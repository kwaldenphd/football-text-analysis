THIS UNIVERSITY was founded in 1842, by the Congregation of
the Holy Cross, under the direction of Very Rev. E. Sorin, and
was chartered by the Legislature of the State of Indiana in 1844,
with power to confer all the usual degrees.
The College buildings are on an eminence near two small picturesque
lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of the fine and healthy farm-
ing region of the Saint Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the
river. The College can easily be reached from all parts of the United
States and Canada by means of three great trunk lines of railway—
the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, the Chicago and Lake Huron,
and the Great Western and Michigan Central; the former passing
within a mile of the College grounds, and the latter connecting at
Niles with the recently-built railway between that place and South
Bend, which runs within a half mile of the College. At the Michigan
Southern Railroad depot, South Bend, omnibuses or private convey-
ances can be obtained.
The buildings are well adapted for the purposes for which they
were erected. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleeping
apartments and Recreation-Halls are commodious, and capable of giv-
ing accommodation to five hundred resident students.
THE SITE
of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the
Students. It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering
■a spot naturally beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution : a description of all
that pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limit, of these
PROSPECTUS.
9
pages. We prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons, and
to all who think of confiding their sons to our care, to come and see,
and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from the
RETIRED POSITION
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at
heart the education of their children; and even the careless student,
when once interested in his studies, soon finds out the benefits he can
derive from an uninterrupted attention to class and study. Though
secluded in a great measure from the busy world without, yet the num-
ber of students and the extensive College grounds give him a world of
his own, in which, what with Class, Examination, Notes, Literary So-
cieties, Religious Associations, Baseball Clubs, Boat Clubs, Dramatic,
Musical, Literary, and Scientific Entertainments, he finds full enjoy-
ment and amusement, and companions, ideas and sentiments that all
concur to fix his mind on his studies and establish him in habits of
piety, application and order, the influence of which will be felt during
his entire life. He breathes for a few short years the atmosphere of
order, of regularity, in all that he does ; of profound application to
studies, broken only b}r healthy and regular recreation; and certainly
in our times, when serious and solid studies are becoming so rare—
when all kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time are
forced upon young students—when morals are so lightly watched over
—the advantage of the retired location of Notre Dame cannot be
too highly spoken of.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to
health; and .those who have had their sons in the College can give
their testimony that the regular course of life, added to the salubrious
climate and the fresh country air, has done much to improve the health
of their children.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to pre-
serve order and regularity. The morals and general deportment of the
pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal
habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their
own families.
THE EDUCATION
given at Notre Dame is calculated to form both the heart and intel-
lect of the students. Every attention is given to their moral and relig-
10	UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.
ious culture. Every clay the students have an opportunity of attending
classes where they may acquire a knowledge of Christian Doctrine.
Twice a week, lectures and instructions on religious topics are delivered
to all the students together. Finally, a regular course of Dogmatic
Theology is established in the University for the benefit of the more
advanced students, who may desire to enter the world having their
minds stored not only with profane science but also with what is much
more important—a thorough knowledge of their religion. The religious
instruction is, of course, confined to Catholic students. The intellec-
tual training is carried on with care and diligence by the officers and
Professors of the University. The best systems of teaching are
adopted, and the best authors for each branch selected; so that no pains
are spared to secure the objects which the University has in view as an
educational institution.
THE MINIM DEPARTMENT.
For the care and training of children under the age of thirteen, there
has been established a Department distinct from, and independent of
the University; it is known as the Minim Department, and has ever
been one of the greatest objects of interest to persons visiting Notre
Dame. The pupils in this Department, unless for their out-door sports,
pass the day entirely under the care of Sisters who take a tender and
motherly care of their young charges.
All the elementary branches of an English education are here taught,
together with French and German. Also, for the Minims, Music (piano)
is not an extra. In order to develop this Department, and thereby ex-
tend the advantages it affords for the forming of the young heart, a
reduction of |25 a session (of five months) has lately been made in
favor of the Minims.
Not the least considerable of the advantages enjoyed by the pupils
of the Minim Department is their complete separation from the larger
students. The discipline to which they are subject is much milder
than that of the students more advanced in age.
REGULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
All students are required to attend the exercises of public worship
with punctuality and decorum.
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful towards the
Professors and Prefects of the Institution. They must never absent

themselves from the place in which they ought to he, without permis-
sion from proper authority.
Students must carefully avoid every expression in the least injurious
to religion or morals, their Professors, Prefects or fellow-students.
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden, except to such students of
the Senior Department as have received the written permission of their
parents to use it, and intoxicating liquors are absolutely prohibited.
Compensation for all damage done to the furniture or other property
of the College will be required from the person or persons causing such
damage.
Nd branch of study, once commenced, shall be discontinued without
permission from the Director of Studies.
No one shall leave the University grounds without the permission of
the President or Vice-President, or the one delegated to represent
them.
Students are expected to take baths regularly.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the class-room, or
who have been guilty of misconduct, must perform such tasks as may
be assigned them, and shall be excluded from all College exercises
until these tasks be accomplished.
No book, periodical, or newspaper shall be introduced into the
College without being previously examined and approved by the Di-
rector of Studies. Objectionable books found in the possession of
students will be withheld from them until their departure from the
University, or destroyed.
All letters sent or received by students may be opened by the Presi-
dent or his representative.
GENERAL INFORMATION.
The academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September,
and closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Com-
mencement, the Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums
take place. It is divided into two Sessions of five months each. At
the termination of each Session a strict examination of all the different
classes is made in the presence of the Faculty. There is no vacation at
Easter.
When a student presents himself for admission into the College he
is examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which
his previous attainments may have qualified him. His further promo-
tion depends on his application and progress. Should any student,
12	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
during the year, be found capable of passing to a higher class, he will
be promoted, and such promotion is equivalent to the honors of the
class he left.
The Decree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the
students as shall have completed the Classical Course, and passed suc-
cessfully an examination in all the branches of the course, before the
Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the grad-
uates of the first degree who shall have devoted at least two years to
literary or scientific studies, and shall have sustained satisfactorily an
appropriate thesis. Students desiring to receive this degree should
make application in writing.
The degree of LL.B., as also those of Bachelor of Science, Master of
Science, and Civil Engineer, will be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course and passed a satisfactory examination before the
Board of Examiners. In all cases, students receiving diplomas are
supposed to be of good moral character.
No student will receive a Diploma or University Honor of any Icind
until such time as all indebtedness to the Institution shall have been
satisfactorily settled.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the
French and German Languages. Not only are these Languages
taught very carefully by persons of acknowledged competency, but
also there is every opportunity for conversation in these tongues.
All students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions
and By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty : such as the Arch-
confraternity, Holy Angels, Holy Childhood, St. Aloysius Philodemic,
Classical, Scientific, Thespian, St. Cecilia, Columbian, Saint Stanislaus
Philopatrian, and Philharmonic Societies, Cornet Band and Orchestra,
with some of which students are recommended to connect themselves.
JO" In case of sickness the student does not remain in the College
rooms, but is immediately taken to the Infirmary, where he is attended
and nursed with devoted care, by experienced Sisters, whose attention
to the sick needs no recommendation.

CIVIL ENGINEERING.
Candidates for admission into this Course must pass a thorough ex-
amination in the Chemistry and Physics of the Scientific Course and
in the several branches of Pure and Mixed Mathematics, besides Gram-
mar, Rhetoric, History, Geography, and Geology. The Course requires
one year, as follows :

Students wishing to pursue a scientific course will find every fa-
cility for doing so at Notre Dame. Fully aware of the demands of the
age, the authorities have spared neither pains nor expense to meet all
the requirements of the students of the Physical and Natural Sciences.
The Physical Cabinet
contains an extensive collection of apparatus of the latest style and
most improved construction. Several of them were on exposition at
the Centennial, and obtained for those who-exhibited them the highest
26	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
awards given for physical instruments. Among these may be men-
tioned Konig’s Apparatus for analyzing sound, electrical and optical ap-
paratus by Edgerton, instruments for projection, etc. Besides the appa-
ratus designed for subjective use and for experimental purposes in the
class-room, there is a large number of select instruments for lecture
purposes, especially for illustrating those interesting branches of phys-
ics, acoustics, optics, magnetism and electro-magnetism, and statical and
dynamical electricity. In acoustics the instruments for studying the
origin and nature of sound, the existence and interference of vibrations,
together with the beautiful apparatus designed by Lissajous, Konig
and others for the observation of sonorous vibrations by the optical
and stroboscopic method and by means of manometric flames, are of
the most improved character. The instruments for illustrating optics
are also most select and complete. Besides the stereopticons, verti-
cal lanterns, microscopes, spectroscopes, etc., for projection, there is a
large number of slides, transparencies and preparations for illustrating
the various branches of physical and natural science, astronomy, archi-
tecture, art, etc. The apparatus for the study of spectrum analysis—
including a fine Heidelberg spectroscope, a collection of Plucker tubes
for obtaining the spectra of gases and vapors—prisms, lenses and other
apparatus for projecting spectra on the screen, as well as those used in
studying the phenomena of the double refraction and polarization of
light, should also be mentioned. Eor studying statical and dynami-
cal electricity, magnetism, and electro-magnetism there is a large num-
ber of electrical machines, and batteries of different kinds, coils, helices,
• magnets, electro-magnets, galvanometers, thermo-electric multipliers,
Geisler tubes, rotators, magneto-electric and electro-magnetic machines,
telegraph apparatus, telephones, etc.
The Chemical Laboratory
is fitted up with all the appliances necessary for the successful study
of General Chemistry and Chemical Analysis. As in the Physical
Cabinet, additions are constantly being made to the Laboratory, and it
will be the object of the authorities to make it in all its details as com-
plete and perfect as possible.
The Museum of Natural History,
embracing large and rare geological, mineralogical, zoological and bo-
tanical collections, is as complete in all its arrangements as the student
could desire. During the past year upwards of $15,000 worth of
NATURAL AND PHYSICAL’ SCIENCES.
27
specimens have been secured for the Museum, many of which are of
great rarity and value. Besides the specimens obtained by donation
and purchase, two of the largest Museums in the West have during the
past year been added to the already extensive collections of the Univer-
sity. These were Dr. Boyd’s large collection of Skeletons, the same
that was on exhibition at the Inter-State Exposition in Chicago last year,
and Mr. J. M. Veasey’s extensive Museum of minerals, fossils and ani-
mals, collected in Colorado and the adjoining territories, and said to
have been one of the largest and most valuable collections illustra-
tive of the Fauna and mineralogical resources of the Rocky Mountain
Range ever exhibited.
The Cabinet of Natural History and Comparative
Osteology
is rich in stuffed specimens, both native and foreign, alcoholic prepara-
tions, shells, skeletons, etc. The collection of skeletons is one of the
most complete in the country. Most of them were prepared in Lon-
don and Paris, or by Dr. Ward, of Rochester, N. Y. They are all
artistically mounted and embrace typical specimens of all the classes
of vertebrates. Among the more rare and valuable specimens of this
collection may be mentioned the skeleton of a gorilla, one of the few
in the United States; the skeletons of a chimpanzee, and of several
other Primates; the skeletons of a large number of carnivores, rodents,
ruminants, pachyderms, marsupials, edentates, birds, chelonians, sau-
rians, ophidians, batrachians, fishes, etc. Among the most conspic-
uous of these may be named the skeletons of the serval, grey wolf,
black bear, capybara, beaver, white-haired porcupine, American bison,
common sheep, horse, wapiti or American elk, collared peccary,
two-toed sloth, condor, emeu, silvery spoonbill, bald eagle, the black
mute, and whistling swan, alligator, boa-constrictor, skull of babyrussa,
etc., etc.
The Mineralogical Cabinet
contains a large collection of minerals from all parts of the world. It
is especially rich in specimens illustrating the crystalline structure,
modes of occurrence, etc., of the various ores and minerals, and embraces
a large number of magnificent specimens of pellucid quartz crystals,
cairngorm stone, amethyst, agate, jasper, sardonyx, chalcedony, geodes
of various kinds, calcite of all the principal crystalline forms, amazon
stone, fluorspar, mica, tourmaline, beryl, dendrite, selenite, garnet,

the various ores of gold, silver, iron, copper, lead, zinc, as well as of the
other metals of rarer occurrence. For the practical study of the phys-
ical properties of minerals the student of mineralogy will find in this
collection all he could wish for. Besides this there is also a rich store
of specimens for blow-pipe analysis.
The Geological Cabinet
is very complete, both in the number and character of the specimens it
contains. It embraces fossils of all the geological formations, both of
this country and Europe. Among them are many unusually well pre-
served, and of more than ordinary size. In a word, it is furnished with
all the specimens that the student needs to make the study of Geology
easy and interesting.
The Herbarum
embraces, besides a collection of American plants, a most beautiful
and interesting collection of New Zealand plants, principally ferns,
collected by the learned missionary, Rev. S. Barthos, during a resi-
dence of several years in New Zealand, and donated to the University.
In addition to this it contains probably the most complete collection
of European plants ever made—the celebrated Herbarium of M. Gauvin,
for many years President of the French Institute. M. Gauvin and his tal-
ented lady, also an excellent botanist, spent upwards of twenty years in
making this collection, which for illustrating the Flora of Europe was
at the time considered one of the most complete and valuable in France,
if not in Europe. It contains all the species of marine and terrestrial
plants that untiring industry and perseverance could procure.
Popular Features on the Physical and Natural Sciences
form one of the most interesting features in connection with the Scientific
Department. These are intended mainly for those students who cannot
or who do not wish to take up the Scientific Course, but who never-
theless desire to have a general knowledge of the leading facts and
principles of the Physical and Natural Sciences. All these lectures, es-
pecially those on Physics and Chemistry, are illustrated experimentally,
and, to attain most effectually the object in view, the best of apparatus
and specimens, especially those designed for projection, have been
secured. This method of popularizing science is, we believe, pecu-
liar to Notre Dame, not having yet been introduced, at least as far
as we are aware, in any other college in the country. All who
LAW DEPARTMENT.	29
have had an opportunity of judging of its results speak of it with
praise and commendation.
Donations to the Museibm.
During the past year, many donations of specimens have heen made
to the Museum, all of which the authorities of the College most grate-
fully acknowledge. Mark S. Foote, of Burlington, Iowa, has contrib-
uted a large and valuable collection of geodes of various species; Mr.
Rudolph Rheinboldt, of Cincinnati, Ohio, a number of beautiful speci-
mens of quartz crystals, agate, amethyst, and petrified wood; Mr. Thos.
Shortis, of Toronto, Canada, a fine selection of Canadian ores; Mr.
Frank Cannon, of Philadelphia, Pa., a collection of marbles, American
and foreign; Dr. Muller, of Carthagena, Ohio, a classified collection
of silver, copper and antimony ores; Prof. Chapman, of Toronto, Can-
ada, a number of beautiful crvstals of various ores and minerals ; Bro.
Francis Regis, 0. S. C., a collection of gold and of silver ores from
Nevada and Utah; Charles Clarke, of Laramie, Wyoming, a num-
ber of petrifactions; Hon. John Gibbous, of Keokuk, Iowa, a collec-
tion of geodes of unusual size and beauty; and Louis and Pius Zahm,
of Huntington, Ind., fossils and Indian relics. Besides the foregoing the
Curator is under obligations to many other kind friends, who from
time to time have made valuable donations to the Museum.
The Curator of the Museum most respectfully solicits the assistance
of the old students and friends of Notre Dame, in enlarging and com-
pleting the collections illustrating natural history, ethnology, etc.
Specimens of minerals, shells, stuffed animals, alcoholic preparations, ।
Indian relics, coins, etc., will be most thankfully received and labelled
with the name of the donor.

All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included
in the Course. The Common Law System of Pleading and Practice is
taught. The Course of Studies in this Department embraces, chiefly,
Constitutional and International Law, Municipal Law, Law of Con-
tracts, Equity Jurisprudence, Criminal Law, Evidence, Pleading and
Practice.
For the purpose of acquiring a practical as well as a theoretical
30	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
knowledge of the legal profession, the students shall, during the Course,
be required to argue cases, draw up pleadings, and conduct Law and
Chancery suits according to the rules and formalities of regular courts
of justice.
As it is a matter of the highest importance to a young lawyer that
on being admitted to the practice of his profession he should be able
to express himself clearly and fluently, full opportunity will be offered
for cultivating the art of public speaking. As one means of attaining
this end, and for the purpose of familiarizing the student with the
practical workings of his future profession, Moot Courts, under the
direction of a Professor, will be frequently held during the Course.
For the cultivation of other kinds of eloquence, still further facilities
are afforded in the various Literary and Debating Societies of the
University.
The entire Course for those commencing the study of the Law is
intended to be completed in two years, divided into four terms, which
correspond with those of the other departments of the University.
Every applicant for admission into this Department is expected to
have, at least, a complete English education. It is very desirable that
he should also have a Classical training before commencing the study
of the Law; nevertheless those who may not possess this advantage
will without extra charge be offered ample opportunities for acquiring
a knowledge of the Classics wdiile pursuing their legal studies.
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time,
but it is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves
at the beginniug of a term.
The students will be required to pass an examination at the close of
each term, and to present an essay of not more than seven pages of
legal cap on some of the matters which they shall have seen, and fur-
thermore to give proof of proficiency in Rhetoric, English Literature
and Logic, before being allowed to graduate. The notes of the special
examinations and essays, as well as those of the application and general
standing of the members in class throughout the Law Course, will be
placed to their respective credits in the result of the final examination
for the degree of LL. B. The following comprises a list of the authors
generally read during the Course:—Walker’s American Law ; Black-
stone’s Commentaries; Parsons’ Contracts; Greenleaf’s Evidence;
Washburn on Real Property; Stephen on Pleading; Equity Jurispru-
dence—Story; Constitutional Law; Criminal Law—Bishop.

Post- Gradziate Course.
I
i The Students in this Course occupy themselves with Philosophy,
! History, the Natural and Physical Sciences. Law, Medicine and Civil
Engineering may be optional studies of the Course.
Lazo Department.
; We trust to see our Law Department better and better attended
I year after year. We have every reason to be proud of the young men
i who each year have sought the classic retirement of Notre Dame to
i pursue their Law Studies. We shall endeavor to make their sojourn
j among us an agreeable one, and give them every facility for study.
C ivil Eng in eering.
This important Course is now thoroughly established, and will afford
j our advanced students the opportunity of fitting themselves for the
‘ practice of the eminent profession whose name it bears.
{	Languages.
i It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame
1 to promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is so
SPECIALTIES.	35
frequent and necessary for business or scientific purposes. To facili- ’
tate this study, no extra fee is now exacted.
The German language—the classes of which are so numerously al- 1
tended—has been taught by five Professors during the past scholastic
year. The number of German students attending the University is
becoming greater every year. The French language—though more
especially the language of the Collegiate Course—will be of great
advantage to the Scientific students. Other languages—such as Ital-
ian and Spanish—may be taught when required.
Phonography and Tdegraph y.
These two branches invite the special attention of the students of the
Commercial Course. The Telegraph Department is fully organized,
and' placed under the management of a skilful electrician. Notre
Dame is now in direct communication with South Bend and the rest
of the world by electric wires.
Anatomy and Materia Medic a.
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find
opportunities to do so at Notre Dame. The Course of Studies in this
Department embraces Materia Medica, Anatomy and Surgery. For
acquiring a thorough knowledge of Anatomy, the student will find the
Museum, mentioned on pages 26 and 27, of invaluable practical as-
sistance. As a Preparatory Course, that which is given here, under
L. Neyron, M. D., leaves nothing to be desired.
Drawing and Painting.
The Drawing Classes each year show a large increase over the pre-
ceding years. The University enjoys means adequate to all demands
in this branch. It possesses a large number of models in all sorts of ■
drawings, a fine Studio, and vigilant and zealous teachers of the art.
Painting promises, likewise, to be one of the popular branches of
Art taught at Notre Dame. That famous painter, Greg obi, of Rome, ;
has been engaged to give instructions in oil painting. Gbegori has
no superior in Rome.
Music.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has five
Professors, and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory
system. An Orchestra of fifteen pieces, with an excellent Quartette,
; 36	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
and a Brass Band of twenty-five instruments, are some of the leading
i features of the Musical Department.
; Vocal music receives special regard. We call the attention of our
students and patrons to this favorite and useful branch of music, which
is now so deservedly popular. At present it may be studied free of
charge.
.zl stronoiu ical Observatory.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which
the fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been
placed. The studies of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered
practically interesting.
Libraries.
The College Library contains some thirteen thousand volumes,
very carefully arranged by the Librarian. Donations of books, espec-
ially to the Law Library, -will be thankfully received.
The Circulating Library was commenced three years ago with
four hundred volumes. It now numbers over three thousand. All the
Libraries which formerly belonged to the Literary and Religious So-
cieties have been merged into it. Instead of the dozen or more book-
cases which often hid away instructive books, a collection of Literary,
Religious, Historical and Scientific works is now open to the students,
in an apartment fitted up as a reading-room.
Lecture Course.
There are a great many students who, owing to different causes,
progress but slowly in the acquisition of knowledge in the class-room, |
but who in the lecture-hall advance most rapidly, whilst all gain a !
more comprehensive and practical perception of the various branches
of Science when clearly and concisely elucidated by the discourse of an
expert. The importance of Lectures has, therefore, never been over-
looked at Notre Dame, but of late the authorities of the University
have been led to devote particular attention to the organizing and
developing of Lecture Courses on all the different important studies of
the Institution. Henceforth, therefore, students may expect to have
every facility, without any interruption of classes, to assist at regular
Lectures on Philosophical, Historical, Literary and Scientific subjects.
In this respect, the success reached during the past two years forms an
epoch in our educational training, and there is every reason for be-
lieving that the future will witness still greater triumphs.

office of President, Vice-President, or Director of Studies of the Uni-
versity, and those on whom honorary Degrees have been conferred by
the Faculty. Those who have been prominently connected with the

The Notre Dame Scholastic
is the title of a neat 16-page paper published every week during term
time at the University. This journal opens a field for young aspirants
to literary fame, who might otherwise for want of a proper medium
allow their talents in this line to remain inactive. It also contains
many articles of an instructive and literary character from writers of
mature and acknowledged ability, thus rendering The Scholastic a
valuable publication for all who desire variety and instruction in their
reading. During the past years there have appeared in its pages many
interesting Biographical Sketches of men of note in Literature, Science,
Painting, Sculpture, etc., Essays in prose and verse, and notes on Art,
Music and Literature, gleaned from the best sources. It will be the
honest endeavor of the Editor, during the coming year, to merit the
encouragement given the paper in the past, and the high encomiums |
bestowed upon it by gentlemen of high culture and by first-class papers !
among the weekly press.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic attaches to itself
a local importance to students, to their parents, and to all who have
in former years attended class at the University, by a weekly summary
of events transpiring at Notre Dame, by personal notices of the old
students, weekly Bolls of Honor, Class Honors, and lists of excellence.
Deports relative to the arrangement of classes, the promotion of the
more talented and energetic students, etc., will also find a place in this
paper, and keep parents and friends accurately informed on all that
concerns their children.

parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters. A
regular omnibus line between South Bend, Notre Dame and St. Mary’s, connects
