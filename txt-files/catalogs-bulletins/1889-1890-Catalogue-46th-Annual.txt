Notre Dame University.
Historical.

HE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME, like all
permanent institutions in this country and abroad, is
the result of gradual growth. It was founded in the
year 1842 by the Very Reverend Edward Sorin, Superior
General of the Congregation of the Holy Cross; in 1844
it was chartered by the general assembly of the State of
Indiana. In older countries a university requires many more
years for development than in ours, and fifty years seem only a
short space in the history of Oxford or Paris, Cambridge or Lou-
vain. But with us the progress of the country stimulates devel-
opment more quickly. Building was added to building, and course
to course, until Notre Dame became a veritable University. On
April 23, 1879, five of the college buildings were destroyed by fire.
The loss included the library, museums, and scientific apparatus.
In this case the destroyer proved a friend. In September, 1879,
the colleges had been rebuilt, and the beginning of the present
extended group of buildings had . been made. The new order
of things fulfilled a hope rather than a promise of the old, and
the Notre Dame of to-day, with its magnificent equipment, its
standard of studies, and its increasing influence, more than real-
izes the most sanguine expectations even of those who had the
firmest belief in the probabilities of higher education in the
West. A brief review of the
Material Equipment of the University
seems not inappropriate.
Main Building. This is five stories- high; while its dimen-
sions are 320 x 155 feet. The distance from the ground to the
electric light just above the statue surmounting the dome is 207
feet. This building contains the libraries, museums, art galleries,
6
IO	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
class-rooms, study-halls, dormitories, lavatories, refectories, etc.
On the first floor are the refectories, lavatories, trunk-rooms,
armories, etc. The refectories are richly ornamented with mural
paintings, representing many of the most celebrated churches and
buildings in the world, and beautifully illustrating the progress
of architecture. The lavatories are supplied with hot and cold
water, and have all the customary accommodations. The
armories contain about 150 stand of arms, with bayonets, accou-
trements, etc. These arms were procured from the State, and
students of the Senior and Junior departments may make use of
them, form companies, and learn to drill. The reception parlors,
and offices of the President, Secretaries, and Prefect of Discipline
are on the main floor, as are also the study-halls, several of the
class-rooms, the telegraph office, and the Students’ office. This
floor is made of tiling, while the corridor is lined with a series
of superb mural paintings (the work of the distinguished Roman
artist, Signor Lugi Gregori), which illustrate the leading events
in the life of Columbus, or, more particularly, such of them as
history associates with the discovery of America. Portraits of
distinguished ecclesiastics, including almost all the Catholic
Bishops in the United States, those living as well as those who
have gone to their reward, line the walls of the corridors on the
floor above, and it-is appropriately called the “Bishops’ Gallery.”
The society-rooms are on the same floor, as are also some of the
class-rooms. They are tastefully ornamented with paintings,
mural decorations, and busts of noted personages. Two large
dormitories are likewise on this floor. The Lemonnier Library
is on the third floor, and there also is a Museum of Curiosities.
Two large dormitories, that correspond in size and appearance to
those below, occupy the rest of the floor. The music-rooms of
the vocal classes and the Department of Drawing take up the
greater part of the fourth floor. The Lemonnier Library
contains 30,000 volumes, -besides miscellaneous objects of interest
gathered from all parts of the United States and many other
countries. Three wide oaken staircases afford communication
. between the different floors from the first story to the top of .the

building; and these, supplemented by exits to. the roofs of verandas
and porticoes, with ample means of descending safely to the
ground, remove all danger of personal injury in case of fire.
But the fullest precautions have been taken to guard against that
peril. With a watchman constantly on duty, water on each floor
and hose at hand, there is absolutely no danger of fire. The' halls
throughout the building are wide, high, and spacious. The
many angles which distinguish the building were planned and
constructed in accordance with the prevailing style of architecture
at Notre Dame, which is known as the modern Gothic. These
angles serve to give great strength and solidity to the entire
building, rendering it secure against the fury of the wind and
storm, not to mention the incidental advantages of good light
and perfect ventilation which they afford. Just east of the Main
Building is the magnificent new
Music Hall. This is 170 feet in length by 100 in width, and
over 100 in height. The first floor is divided into recreation and
reading rooms, the north end being for the Juniors and the south
for the 'Seniors. These rooms are supplied with newspapers,
periodicals, games of all kinds, billiard-tables, etc. The dressing
rooms of the Bicycle Club and of the Athletic Association are
also on this floor. The second and third floors at the north end
are appropriately divided into music - rooms, and instrumental
music of all kinds is there taught. The Exhibition Hall occupies
the remainder of the building. In it are given the more formal
lectures, as well as concerts and dramatic entertainments. Fully
furnished with the scenes, accessories and decorations appropriate
to such uses, and capable of accommodating 1200 persons, it
ranks as one of the largest and most attractive college halls in
the country.
Science Hall. The corner-stone of this imposing edifice was
laid by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Watterson, of Columbus, in 1883.
It is situated a few steps south of the Music Hall.- The dimen-
sions are 104 x 131 feet, and the height is three stories, or 75 feet.
It is divided into two departments, and supplied with all the
agencies requisite to facilitate the acquisition of a complete knowl-
12
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
edge of the sciences. The laboratories, machinery department,
lecture-rooms, museums, engine-rooms, microscopic division,
incandescent electric light plant, etc., are admirably arranged and
elegantly finished. The Hall is fully equipped with all necessary
chemicals, preparations, specimens, charts, tools, instruments,
and the innumerable accessories of a great school of science. It
is said to be one of the largest buildings devoted exclusively to
scientific studies in the United States, and its merits, we trust,
will entitle it to rank among the best. The Seniors’ campus or
play-ground, a level tract containing about ten acres, lies south-
east of it. South of it is the
Institute of Technology, a large and commodious building
devoted to the exclusive use of the students of civil, mechanical
and electrical engineering. It is fully equipped with all the
appliances for wood and metal working, and is supplied with the
most approved forms of forges and cupolas for blacksmithing
and foundry work. The rooms for mechanical drawing, and the
laboratories for special experimental work in mechanical engi-
neering, were specially designed for the purposes for which they
are used, and are complete in all their appointments. Northeast
of this is
The Gymnasium, which measures 160 feet in length and 45 in
width, and is two stories in height. It is abundantly supplied
with swings, turning-poles, horizontal bars, and other apparatus
calculated to inspire a taste for gymnastic exercises. The north
half is for the use of the Juniors, whose campus surrounds it,
while the south half is set apart for the Seniors. Just north of
the Gymnasium and Music Hall is St. Edward’s Park; and
fronting this, facing south, is
St. Edward’s Hall, a building four stories high, and 155ft.
in length, by 50 in width. This is for the exclusive use of pupils
under thirteen years of age. It is entirely separate from the
University, though under the same general management. The
building is new, and lacks none of the appointments suggested
by experience as useful or desirable. It is divided into study-
halls, class-rooms, dormitories, etc. The recreation hall is just

east of it, while farther east and north lies the play-ground. The
pupils are under the immediate direction of competent and expe-
rienced teachers—Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.
The Infirmary adjoins St. Edward’s Hall on the west. In
dimensions it is 100 x 45 feet, and three stories high. The
General Office occupies a portion of the first floor. The rooms
on the floor above are kept in readiness for the reception of
students who at any time become too ill to attend class and
discharge their customary duties. The regular physician of the
University and the Sisters in charge minister to the sick in all
cases,
e
The Church stands a little west and south of the main build-
■ ing. It is generally regarded as one of the most symmetrical
and beautiful churches in the country. In size it is 275 x 120ft.,
and the distance from the ground to the apex of the roof is
about 125 feet. It is ornamented with paintings, statuary, altar
accessories, architectural devices, etc., and hours may profitably
be given to the examination and study of these and the multitu-
dinous objects of interest and beauty in which it abounds. In
its tower is one of the largest bells on the American continent.
Besides, there are 32 smaller bells in the tower. These vary in
size and constitute the noted “ chimes of Notre Dame.” South
and west of the Church stands
Sorin Hall. The style of the building is what is currently
called mixed Gothic and Roman. The height from the ground
to apex is about 70 feet. It has a measurement of 144 feet along
its front, or from north to south, while in depth, or from east to
west, it will measure, when completed, 112 feet. The basement,
about two-thirds of which is over the ground level, has a height
of 9 feet from floor to ceiling. Above the basement the structure
rises to the altitude Of three stories. The distance from the first
floor to the ceiling is 15 feet; from the second floor to ceiling,
13 feet, and from the third floor to ceiling, about 12 feet. Three
wide and substantial staircases afford ample means of passing
readily from floor to floor. The basement is sub-divided into
lavatories, bath - rooms, boiler and engine rooms, etc. The
14	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
building is heated throughout by an automatic self-feeding
apparatus placed in the basement. On the first floor are two or
more of the principal offices, a chapel, law lecture room, moot-
court room, law library, society rooms, etc. A large room in
the north part of the building serves as a chapel, while the law
rooms are south of the entrance, with an east and south exposure.
All of them are of ample size, and well fitted for the uses they
are severally intended to subserve. The second and third floors
are almost exclusively appropriated for rooms, corridors, etc.
The building is commodious, thoroughly ventilated, and the
rooms and. corridors are well lighted, and comfortably heated at
all times.
A regularly established United States post-office is situated
on the University grounds, a short distance from the main build-
ing. It is particularly intended for the accommodation of the
University and St. Mary’s Academy. But there are too many
buildings at Notre Dame to receive notice in this connection.
Indeed so numerous are they that, if brought together, they
would cover at least four or five acres of ground. Nevertheless,
the work goes steadily forward and great improvements are
made from year to year.
Surroundings.
The University is situated about a mile and a half north of the
flourishing city of South Bend, Ind., and about eight miles south
of Niles, Mich. It is surrounded by a fertile and prosperous
farming country. And yet, by reason of its proximity to South
Bend, it combines the conveniences and accommodations of city
life with the salutary isolation, wholesome climate, and natural
beauties of the country. A great broad avenue runs directly
south from the University for a mile or more, and on both sides
for half the distance it is lined with shade trees. North and
west of the University are two beautiful lakes—St. Joseph’s and
St. Mary’s. The area of the former is but' a little less than
23 acres. The ground slopes picturesquely down to the lakes,
and beautiful walks along the shores almost surround them. On
PROSPECTUS.	15
the higher ground, above the walks, and overlooking the lakes,
are magnificent groves of oak, hickory, sycamore, and other
varieties of hard timber. St. Joseph’s River, swift of current and
tortuous of channel, sweeps grandly past the University grounds
on the west. The scenery along its steep and timber-lined
banks is bold, wild, romantic.
Accessibility.	■
Notre Dame occupies a position almost central with reference
to the most important cities of the Mississippi Valley. The rail-
roads running directly to South Bend are the Lake Shore and
Michigan Southern, the Grand Trunk, the Vandalia Line, and
the Michigan Central. The road last named is connected with
South Bend by a lateral line which runs south from Niles, Mich.,
and passes through the University grounds. Omnibuses and
other conveyances, by which visitors can expeditiously reach
Notre Dame, may be found on the arrival of trains at the stations
of the roads indicated.
(Discipline.	'
The regulations looking to the maintenance of discipline are
sufficiently liberal to meet the reasonable expectations of all who
try to conduct themselves as gentlemen. To these the rules are
easy of observance, and students whose deportment is not that
of gentlemen must not expect to remain at Notre Dame.
There is probably no great educational institution in the
country in which students become acquainted with one another
more intimately than at this University. They are brought, in
connection with their several duties, into daily, if not hourly
contact. This fact serves to emphasize the importance of requir-
ing compliance with regulations calculated to render them
courteous, upright, honorable, pure in expression, respectful
to religion, and emulous to excel in their several studies.
They are required to rise at the same time in the morning,
and meals are taken by all at the same hours during the day.
All retire not later than io o’clock p.m., and the signal for rising
16	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
is given not later than 6.30 a. m. At proper times, too, they are
expected to take necessary out-door exercise.
While persons of all religious denomination’s are admitted to
participation in the privileges of the University, it is nevertheless
a strictly Catholic institution, and all the students are required
to attend divine service at stated times.
Other regulations, which time has sanctioned as salutary, may
be summarized as follows: 1. No branch of study shall be dis-
continued without permission of the Director of Studies. 2. No
student shall leave the University grounds without permission
of the President or Vice-President, or the persons delegated to
represent them. 3. The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden,,
except to such students of the Senior department as receive from
their parents written permission to use it. 4. The use of intox-
icating liquors is absolutely prohibited under all circumstances,
5. Any person who injures the property of the University must
make compensation for the same. 6. To guard against clan-
destine and improper correspondence, the President reserves
the right to supervise letters to and from students. 7. Books,
periodicals, and newspapers are subject to the approval of the
Director of Studies.
General Remarks.
Neither pains nor expense has been spared to secure- the
services of able, experienced and gentlemanly professors, and
the authorities of the University have reason to believe that their
efforts in this direction have been attended with results particu-
larly gratifying. It may, too, be confidently stated that there- is
no educational institution in the Union that affords students
more time for study or better opportunity to acquire a sound
and comprehensive education than Notre Dame offers. Its
comparative isolation insures immunity from distractions of
every kind: society throws no allurements in the way of the
student to tempt him from the performance of his duties;
PROSPECTUS.	17 j

association with depraved tastes and bad habits is necessarily j
avoided; the surroundings are favorable to study, and the I
student must learn, — even the common pride of wholesome ;
emulation compels him to do so. Moreover, the course of life
pursued under the salutary discipline in force can hardly fail
to establish firmness of character and habits that go to form a
moral, temperate, honorable and conscientious man.
Students are classified according to age as Seniors, Juniors,
and Minims. The Seniors range in age from 17 years upward.
Their dormitories, study-hall, refectory, lavatories, etc., are in
the east half of the University. The Juniors, whose ages range
from 13 to 17 years, occupy the west portion of it. The Minims
have a building exclusively to themselves. The three depart-
ments to which students are thus assigned, are entirely separate
from one another. Seniors and Juniors are seldom brought
together, except in a few classes of the Collegiate Course. The
Minims have no direct intercourse with the students of the other
departments.
There are ample accommodations for six hundred resident
students at the University. The ventilation is exceptionally
good. Scrupulous cleanliness prevails everywhere. The fare is
abundant in quantity, varied in quality, and always wholesome.
The class-rooms are large and well lighted, as are also the rooms
used by the literary, debating, dramatic, and other societies.
The societies devoted more particularly to the cultivation of
music and the drama have always been very popular, and many
of their members have reached a higher degree of proficiency
than mere amateurs are commonly expected to attain. This is
largely due to the fact that they are aided and stimulated by the
sedulous co-operation and encouragement of professors well
qualified to give instruction in music and the drama. Then, too,
there are societies specially intended to promote the interests of
religion and lead to a thorough knowledge of Christian doctrine.
By means of essays and debates great readiness in speaking, as
well as felicity in the expression of thought, is attained by many
members of these societies.
The students of the different departments are under the super-
18	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
vision of their respective prefects and professors; and while they
enjoy all the freedom compatible with the requirements of good
order, they are firmly held to an observance of the courtesies
and manners recognized by gentlemen in their intercourse with
one another. But there is very little occasion for the exercise
of rigor in this respect, as the students come almost invariably
from homes in which they have been brought up under the
salutary influence of careful and proper training. They have
been taught to observe the manners that distinguish upright and
honorable young men; and it is an important aim of the discip-
line in force at Notre Dame to habituate them to such manners,
and to make them in all respects thorough, accomplished and
carefully educated gentlemen — gentlemen whose lives will be
useful and honorable, and tend to reflect credit upon their
parents, themselves and the University.

I.—Special English Course.
TT7HE Faculty of the University of Notre Dame, recognizing
the fact that the exclusive study of the ancient languages
and of pure science is not in itself sufficient for a liberal educa-
tion, have instituted a course which shall provide for a more than
ordinarily thorough acquaintance with the English language and
with English and American literature. At the same time, all that
is most serviceable in the Classical and Scientific courses will be
made an indispensable requisite.
The course will extend over a period of four years, and those
who have completed the prescribed studies and passed the exami-
nations satisfactorily will receive the degree of Bachelor of Tetters.
A high standard will be kept up throughout the course in all
English branches, and the degree will be conferred on no one who,
besides giving evidence of proficiency in the Classics and Science,
has not also given proof of ability to apply the principles of com-
position and shown an acquaintance with the writings of the
best authors in English and American literature.
The appended scheme of the course explains itself; it is only
necessary to emphasize the following points :
[i]	From the beginning of the course to the end special attention will be paid
to Essay writing, and each essay will be read and criticised in its
author’s presence.
[2]	Facilities are afforded for* a training in journalism by the publication,
weekly, of the Notre Dame Scholastic, a twenty-four page paper devoted
to the interests of the students, the columns of which are open to their
contributions. Every student of the course will be expected, after the
expiration of the first year, to contribute to the Scholastic at least two
articles per session.
[3]	A familiarity will be required with the masterpieces of the leading
English and American authors, and students will be encouraged to
ENGLISH COURSE.	37
peruse the works of such authors during their leisure hours by having
access at all times to a library containing a complete collection of all
the English Classics.
[4]	A Graduation Thesis will be required of every student ; this must show',
besides grace of style, a scholarly treatment of the theme selected. The
choice of themes will be left to the graduates, subject to the approval
of the Faculty.
The preparatory studies for this course are the same as those
introductory to the Classical course, with the exception that Latin
or Greek may be replaced by one of the Modern Languages.
The Faculty have determined to spare no pains to render this
course of the utmost value and interest to the students, and to
encourage them to acquire a thorough familiarity with their native
language and a facility in speaking and in composition, which are
everywhere recognized as an indispensable requisite for success in
any profession in which they may be engaged in after life.
The programme of studies is as follows :

English and Mathematics of the Preparatory Department are
requisite for admission into this course. Instead of Greek and
Latin, however, one or more of the modern languages should be
studied. French is particularly recommended for choice, in view of
the valuable contributions to engineering science which continually
appear in French periodicals and cotemporary literature. Either French
or German having been selected, and the usual course, as laid down in
its proper place, having been followed through the Preparatory and
Freshman years, this course will be supplemented, during the Sopho-
more and Junior years, by technical readings in works of acknowledged
merit among Engineers. In French, Rondelet, Chomienne, Lagrene,
and other authors will be read, with selections from current numbers
of the Annales des Ponts et Chaussees and the Revue Scientifique. In
German, current numbers of the Zeitschrift filr Eisenbahnen und
Dampfschiffahrt, of Glaser s Annalen, and of the Mittheilungen aus
den Gebiete des Seewesens, with extracts from Huber, Kreuter and Von
Benko, will form the class exercises.
A course of drawing is also begun in the preparatory years, as this is
an art in which the future Civil Engineer can hardly have too much
practice.

TTTHIS course is designed to familiarize the student simultaneously
A with the principles and practice of Mechanical Engineering. He
will be required to devote from nine to twelve hours a week to the ex-
ercises of the laboratory and workshop, and to give good evidence of
manual dexterity, and an acquaintance with all the operations of the
machine-shop, the wood-working departments, foundery, and black-
smith-shop. The exercises of the fourth year will be confined chiefly
to the making of precise measurements, the testing of materials, engines,
pumps, boilers, etc; a tour of inspection, original research, and prep-
aration of thesis.
Candidates for the Freshman Year must pass an examination in
the branches of the Commercial Course (with the exception of
book-keeping), in Ancient and Modern History, Algebra (through
Quadratic Equations), and Plane Geometry. Practical shop work may
be taken by students of the preparatory grades.

Commereial Course.
THIS Course requires two years’ study for graduation; it includes
arithmetic, grammar, letter-writing, geography, United States
History, reading, orthography, penmanship, book-keeping, and Com-
mercial Law,—in other words, all the branches of a complete business
education.
Considering the character and needs of the country — especially
of the great West in which we live—this course is the most practical,
and one of the most important that an educational institution can
afford.	,	.
Those, therefore, who have not the time or the means to take a com-
plete College course, in the Classics and Sciences, would do well to
enroll themselves' in the Commercial Course. No plan of study is more
injudicious than a hap-hazard selection of such studies as ap inexperi-
enced young man may fancy. The training resulting from a fixed
course of studies is of the utmost benefit to the student.
The Commercial Course at Notre Dame has always received the
most careful attention from the officers and the Commercial Faculty of
the University. Notre Dame claims to give the graduates of this course
a more complete business training than can be obtained in any purely
commercial college. Believing that a business education includes
something more than a mere knowledge of Book-keeping, and that a
good education cannot be had in a few weeks, the authorities have
extended this course over two years,—the shortest time in which the
studies necessarily used in business life can be mastered. Should a
student desire during this period to pursue any other studies in which
he may be interested, and for which he has time, he will have liberty
to do so. General History and Linear Drawing are- especially recom-
mended to the students of this course. They will also in the future
have the opportunity of attending an elementary course of the Physical
and Natural Sciences. Many commercial students find it also to
their advantage to take up the study of German or French, for which
there are the amplest facilities. A talented and studious young man
may thus in the course of two years find himself in the possession of a
most valuable practical education, which will fit him to take his place
in the front rank of educated business men.

Tost= Graduate Course.
THE students in this course occupy themselves with Philosophy,
History, and the Natural and Physical Sciences. Law, Medicine,
and Civil Engineering are optional studies of the Course.
Civil Engineering.
The Course of Civil Engineering has been established of late years,
and it affords advanced students the opportunity of fitting themselves
for the practice of this eminent profession.
The (Department of (Physical and Natural Sciences.
Notre Dame has always given special attention to the cultivation of
the Physical and Natural Sciences, but during the past few years extra
efforts have been made in this direction, with a view of affording to
her students all the facilities and advantages that may be found in the
best equipped scientific schools. A large and commodious building,
in the Romanesque style, known as (l Science Hall,” has been erected
for this purpose, and it is the intention of the authorities to make it as
perfect in all its appointments as any similar institution in the country.
It is one hundred and thirty-one feet long by one hundred and four
feet deep, and proportionally high. There are upwards of twenty-five
spacious, well lighted and well ventilated rooms in the building, nearly
all of which are designed either as lecture rooms or laboratories for the
various branches of experimental science.
The building has been carefully planned for the purposes to which it
is appropriated,and embodies in its construction all the improvements
and conveniences to be found in the most approved scientific structures
of this country and Europe.
Special attention has been given to make the building convenient
both for the professor and student. The laboratories, lecture-rooms,
and cabinets are so connected with one another, and with the grand
apartments set aside for the museum, that specimens and apparatus are
always at hand when desired, and where they can be used. The
students of Natural History have their specimens systematically
Physical, IyAporatory

5 8	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
arranged in rooms adjoining their laboratories, whilst the students of
Chemistry and Physics have their cabinets conveniently near, and, at
the same time, independent of each other, owing to the peculiar
plan of the building. The various classes can enter the rooms and
laboratories without interfering in any way with one another, and can
continue their studies and experiments indefinitely without interruption.
The general principles of science are taught by lectures, and these are-
supplemented by practical work in the various laboratories.
In Chemistry and Physics the necessary apparatus are at the disposal'
of the student, and he is expected to verify, by observation and exper-
iment, what has not been experimentally illustrated in the lectures he
has attended.
In all these departments, as well as in those of Physics and Chem-
istry, special stress will be laid on practical work, and a student’s
proficiency will be estimated by his record of observation and experi-
ment in the laboratory and workshop.
In the study of Botany, Zoology, and Physiology, each student is
provided with a microscope and the necessary accessories, and most
of his time is spent in microscopic study, under the direction of the
professor.
In Geology and Mineralogy the system is the same. The student
commences work in the laborat ry at once, and thus early becomes
acquainted with the various minerals, rocks, fossils, etc. The blow-
pipe, microscope, polariscope and clinometer are in constant use to
verify what has been learned in the lecture room, and to fix it on the
memory.
In the Department of Mechanical Engineering there are fully
equipped workshops, for wood and metals Steam engines and
dynamo-electric generators, and motors of various types and sizes
furnish the power required, and afford the student special facilities
in making experiments concerning the various forms of energy.
A Photographic Laboratory is also fitted up in the building, where
the student is enabled to learn, practically and in a short time, the art
of modern Photography, and thus prepare himself for professional
work in the studio. ,	.
Rooms have likewise been set aside for Assaying and Metallurgy,
and it is the purpose of those in charge to leave nothing undone to
make the work in this department compare favorably with that accom-
plished in the others.
MISCELLANEOUS.

Additions of apparatus, specimens, and books for reference are con-
stantly being made to the various departments, and no effort will be
spared to make ‘ ‘ Science Hall ’ ’ a recognized centre of thorough
work in genuine practical science.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame
to promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is so
necessary for business or scientific purposes.
The German language — the classes of which are so numerously
attended—has been taught by five instructors during the past scholastic
year. The number of students attending the German classes is
becoming greater every year. The study of French is recommended
to all students of the Collegiate Course. The course of Spanish will
receive special attention in the future, and other modern languages
may be taught when required.
Telegraphy and Type=Writing.
These branches invite the special attention of the students of the
Commercial Course. Both departments are fully equipped for practical
work. The Telegraphic Department is superintended by a skilful
electrician, and the classes are under the personal instruction of an
experienced operator who has seen much actual service and held
responsible positions in the railway service.
In the Type-writing Department the machine in use is a first-class
Remington, with the latest improvements. Thorough instruction is
given in the manipulation and care of the machine, in the correct
forms of business letters, law work, essays, and general writing.
Phonography, or Shorthand,
is of very great assistance to those in the higher classes, enabling its
possessor to take verbatim-notes of lectures, etc. It is adaptable to
the English, French, German or Spanish languages. With a good
English education it is a profession in itself, and one not likely to be
overcrowded for years to come. First-class phonographers and type-
writers are always sure of employment, and pupils in both branches
6o
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
here find every facility to fit them for the highest grades of practical
work.
Phonography and Type-writing have of late come into general use
in legal and commercial work—in the court, the law office, and the
counting-room, in business houses, banks, insurance and railroad
offices, etc.,—and, for first-class stenographers especially, the demand
exceeds the supply. A knowledge of these useful arts will therefore
prove a strong recommendation for confidential and lucrative positions.
Elocution.
No educational institution in the country surpasses Notre Dame in
the facilities afforded to students for acquiring proficiency in elocution.
The instruction is thorough, the exercises are practical, and the subjects
of study exhibit judicious variety. These exercises are held in St.
Cecilia Hall, which is peculiarly adapted for the purpose, being eligibly
situated, large, and elegantly furnished. The exercises constitute an
important part in the studies of young men who strive to cultivate,
with success, literature, oratory, and the dramatic art. The approved
methods of stimulating and developing the natural elocutionary powers
are called into requisition as occasion seems to warrant. To this end
the drama receives a due share of attention; from time to time an
appropriate tragedy or comedy is rendered by students, on the stage
of the new Music Hall, with all the customary accessories and appoint-
ments used in connection with dramatic performances. Four public
exhibitions are given during the year, and public literary exercises are
held seven times during the same period, An oratorical contest is one
of the notable features marking the close of the year. For the purpose
of encouraging and stimulating students to put forth their best efforts,
premiums and gold medals are offered to those who most distinguish
themselves. When all these things are duly considered, there need be
no hesitation in repeating that “no educational institution in the
country surpasses Notre Dame in the facilities offered to students for
acquiring proficiency in elocution.”
Anatomy and Materia Medica.
Young men desiring to prepare for the Medical profession will find
opportunities to do so at Notre Dame. The Course of Studies in this
department embraces Materia Medica, Anatomy, and Surgery.

• (Drawing and (Painting.
The University, which is becoming every year more widely and
favorably known as an art center, enjoys ample facilities for imparting
instruction in these branches It possesses a large number of models,
a fine studio, and able and zealous teachers. The eminent artist
Signor Luigi Gregori, of Rome, is still in charge of this department.
(Music.
This department is complete in all its appointments. It has able
Professors and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory-
system. An Orchestra of fifteen pieces, an excellent Quartette, and a
Brass Band of twenty-five instruments, are some of the leading’features
of the Instrumental Music Department.
Vocal Music, to which special attention has been paid, and which
has contributed so much to the pleasure of the students during the
past few years, will receive even more careful attention in future, and it
is hoped that this branch will become every year more popular.
(Peadin g=(Rooms.
The lower floor of the new Music Hall is divided into large and
neatly furnished Reading rooms, for the benefit of the Senior and Junior
departments. These reading rooms are supplied with books and
periodicals from the library, and students have access to them during
the hours of recreation.
The Lemonnier Library
continues to receive contributions from liberal friends, and now numbers
over 25,000 volumes. A reading room has been opened in connection
with the library, in which the leading periodicals of Europe and America
are to be found on file. The members of the Library Association
desire to give their Alma Mater a collection of books which can stand
comparison with those possessed by any other educational establishment
in the United States; therefore they call on the friends of the University
to assist them by donations of books, pamphlets, periodicals, and
manuscripts. All contributions should be addressed to the Librarian
of the Lemonnier Library, Notre Dame University, Notre Dame, Ind.
J^irxinx Department
FOR the care and training of boys under the age of thirteen,
there has been established a Department to which the most
scrupulous attention has always been paid by the College author-
ities ; it is known as the Minim Department, and has ever been
one of the greatest objects of interest to the Faculty as well as to
all persons visiting Notre Dame.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all the elementary
branches of an English education is here imparted, together with a
rudimentary knowledge of Latin, French, and German. Vocal
Music and Drawing form no extra charges. The pupils of this
department are taught by Sisters of the Holy Cross, under whose
maternal and tender care they pa^s nearly the entire day. During
the hours of recreation, and while in the refectory and dormitory,
they are under the charge of kind and efficient Prefects.
n
'	(Discipline.
The following is the order of the day : Rising at half-past six ;
toilet, etc. ; seven, breakfast, after which there is a short time
given for exercise in the Campus ; half-past seven, study ; half-past
nine, recreation and lunch ; ten, study ; a quarter to twelve, toilet ;
twelve, dinner, followed by recreation ; half-past one, study ; half-
past three, recreation and lunch ; half-past six, supper and recrea-
tion ; half-past eight, retiring. From this it may be seen that while
the Minims devote never less than six hours a day to study, they are
never more than two hours in succession in the class-room. The
recreation and exercise in the fresh air, between each two hours of
study, unbend the mind- and prepare the boys to return to their
classes refreshed and ready for work.
The Minims are always under supervision, during the hours
of recreation, as well as in the class-room and study-hall. The
presence, however, of the Prefects is far from being a restraint on
the amusement of the boys ; for while it is the duty of the Prefects
to insist that their young charges shall always keep within the
limits of the strictest propriety, they, at the same time, take part in
64
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
all sports, organize games, and do everything in their power to I
foster a love of healthful exercise. The play-grounds consist of a
fine level five-acre field, well supplied with turning-poles, swings,	*
ladders, rings, parallel-bars, and all other. necessary gymnastic	;
apparatus. That the boys make good use of them can best be seen (
from their healthy, happy appearance, which invariably attracts '
the notice of visitors.	i
Connected with the play-ground is a fine brick play-hall, !
160 feet long, heated by steam. There the boys play in rainy
or cold weather. In this building is one of the finest hand-ball (
alleys at Notre Dame. Adjoining the grounds is a large orchard
to which the Minims have access in proper season. They are
allowed so many privileges of a similar nature that, among the
students of the other departments, they are often pleasantly spoken
of as the “privileged class of the little college world.” The Sisters
preside at the toilet ; they clean and mend the clothing, see to all i
the needs and to the comfort and convenience of the Minims.
Baths are taken every Saturday. Underclothing is changed regu- ' i
larly twice a week. Great care is taken that the boys be neatly
dressed, and that the clothing be suitable for the season.
Societies.
There are two societies in the Minim Department : that of the
Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its object to
supply servers for the Church offices ; and the Sorin Association,
which has been established with a view to give the pupils a start,
as early as possible, in Elocution. The Society is in charge of one
of the Professors, who finds it a pleasant duty to draw out the
talent of these interesting young orators. Meetings.are held once
a week, after school hours. These meetings are a source of
pleasure as well as of profit. The members prepare original
compositions, deliver declamations, are trained to debate, etc.
Only the best behaved and more advanced in studies are admitted
to membership. To encourage this young Literary Society a Gold
Medal is annually awarded at Commencement for Elocution to the
most deserving member.
------------------------------------------n
MINIM DEPARTMENT.	65	'
General (Remarks.
The discipline to which the Minims are subjected is much
milder than that which is suited to students more advanced in age.
Recourse is scarcely ever had to punishment. Those in charge
endeavor to govern by kindness and gentleness, and by appealing
to the boys’ sense of honor. The names of all whose conduct and
application to studies are satisfactory appear under the heads of
Roll of Honor and Class Honors in the Scholastic^ a paper pub-
lished weekly at Notre Dame. To find his name mentioned in
these rolls is found to be as great a reward for the deserving pupil,
as its non-appearance is a punishment for the undeserving.
Then, again, there is a Gold Medal awarded at the end of two
full years to all whose deportment has been unexceptionable during
that period. As this fact is made known to the Minim immediately
after his entrance, he generally endeavors to shape his conduct with
a view to receiving an “ Honor.” The greatest care is taken to
form their young hearts to habits of virtue, and to inculcate the
practice of refined manners. Every effort is made to foster respect
and affection for parents, to whom they are expected to write, at
least, once a week.
Not the least of the advantages enjoyed by the Minims is their
complete separation from the larger students. An elegant and
commodious building, known as St. Edward’s Hall, affording
ample accommodations for over one hundred pupils, is devoted to
their use. It is four stories in height, ninety-five feet long, and
forty-five feet wide ; heated by steam, supplied throughout with
the Edison incandescent electric light, and provided with hot and
cold water. The ceilings in the Study Hall, Class Rooms, and
sleeping apartments are fifteen feet high. The windows are large
and numerous, affording abundant light and ventilation. The
Study Hall commands a charming view from each of its eleven
large windows. It is tastefully decorated with statuary, beautiful
pictures, choice plants, and beautiful flower caskets, etc. Besides
the pleasure the Minims derive from studying in this bright, beau-
tiful hall, their habits and tastes are cultured by coming into contact
with such refining objects. Fronting the building is a handsome
66
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
park, which, with its sparkling fountain, rare trees and flowers,
adds not a little to the beauty of St. Edward’s Hall, as well as to
the happiness of the Minims.
These remarks, which have been made to satisfy parents and
others, who frequently write for more detailed information, will
show that, while the Minims have every possible advantage to aid
them in acquiring a good, solid education, they have also a most
happy home where they enjoy the same ease and freedom that
they would enjoy under the care of their mothers.

SENIOR DEPARTMENT.
RELIGIOUS.
Archconfraternity of tlie Immaculate Heart of Mary.
This pious Association is affiliated to the Archconfraternity of the
Sacred and Immaculate Heart of Mary, established in the Church of
Our Lady of Victories, in Paris. Its primary object is to pray for the
conversion of sinners and persons in error. It aims at the mutual
edification and personal sanctification of all its members by regular
weekly religious exercises, monthly communions, and other religious
practices. The Archconfraternity is the oldest society in the Univer-
sity, and recruits its members from amongst the Catholic students of
the Senior and Junior Departments. It was canonically established at
Notre Dame by the Very Rev. Father Sorin in 1845, and bids fair
to continue to be in the future, as it has been in the past, for the
students of Notre Dame, a source of many blessings from the hands
of their tender-hearted Mother, the Immaculate Mother of God.
Number of members in the Senior Department, 175.

Society of the Holy Childhood.
The primary object of the Society of the Holy Childhood, of which
this society forms a part, is to offer an opportunity to children through-
out the world to contribute their share towards the redemption of pagan
children from the darkness of heathenism. The monthly contributions
are small, but the aggregate is considerable, while thousands of children
are by this means trained up to habits of charity.

ATHLETIC.
Tlie Hoynes Light Guards.
This battalion has within the past-two or three years attained to a
degree of proficiency in military tactics that entitles it to a high rank
among the cadet military organizations of the Northwest. It is armed
with “three-click” Springfield rifles of the latest pattern, and supplied
with all the requisite accoutrements of light infantry. It comprises
three companies, and has a total membership of about 125. These
companies are composed respectively of Seniors and Juniors, all of
whom are tastefully uniformed, and have a soldierly appearance and
bearing. Their proficiency in the use of arms has long been a subject
of general remark and compliment. They are taught the maneuvers,
manual of arms, and all the ordinary evolutions described in “ Upton’s
United States Tactics.” In what is technically known as the school of
the soldier and the school of the company they are instructed by their
captains, lieutenants, and non-commissioned officers, while in battalion
and regimental drill they come more immediately under the command
of the colonel. Enlistment is altogether voluntary. No student need
become a member unless he desires to do so. However, the authorities
of the University duly encourage such organizations on account of the
salutary physical exercise they afford, the respect for wholesome discip-
line they tend to promote, and t]je manly bearing they serve to assure
and establish.

SORIN HARL is a commodious building recently erected for
the use of advanced students. It is situated a short distance
southwest of the church. Facing east, it is on a line with
Science Hall, from which it is separated by an extensive green
sward and a beautiful grove. It is a three-story and-basement
building, and presents a very attractive appearance. In its con-
struction special attention was paid to sanitary conditions, and
every apartment and hall is well lighted and ventilated. During
the day sunshine visits every room in the building. All the
recent improvements in architecture were considered and discrim-
inatingly introduced in constructing and completing Sorin Hall
and arranging its interior with reference to the convenience of
the inmates. It contains a large number of rooms for the use of
students, besides several apartments intended for other purposes.
Bach of the students’ rooms is supplied with a 16-candle electric
light, and is heated by steam in cold weather. This building
has its own furnace and heating apparatus and its own dynamo
or electric-light plant. All its arrangements are suggestive of
the conveniences and comforts of a home.
The basement is divided into a reading-room, where the student
finds all the late magazines, both American and foreign ; a large
apartment designed for recreation purposes at suitable times ; a
room for the furnace, coal, etc. ; also bath-rooms, toilet-rooms,
and the like.
On the first floor, at either side of the main entrance, are two
suites of elegant rooms for offices and chambers. The large
apartment at the north end of the building is used as a chapel,
and here the students assemble morning and evening for prayer.
The Raw Department, with its library, lecture-room, moot-court
room, etc., is at the south end.
The second and third floors are uniform in arrangement and
similar in appearance. Here are the rooms that the students
occupy. All of them are regularly numbered and neatly fur-
• nished ; and there is not one of them that does not command an
extended and beautiful view. They serve as chambers for the
young men at night and study-rooms during the day. Bach
room has only one occupant. Thus it is sought to insure a
proper and profitable use of time by all. This same considera-
tion has led the College authorities to prohibit the inmates of
Sorin Hall from calling on one another or visiting the rooms of
others. While not at class, nor at meals, nor engaged in taking
necessary recreation upon the campus, students are supposed to
be at work in their rooms, although at suitable times they may
106	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
meet in the reading room or recreation apartment. This build-
ing is intended for earnest and well-disposed students who desire
to make the best possible use of their time ; and the rules pre-
scribed for its inmates are practically in harmony with the regular
standard of living to which young men of that class seek to i
conform. For these the rules will be found very simple and easy ‘
of observance. For others there can be no relaxation of them.
The penalty for the violation of any of them consists in the for- '
feiture by the offender of his room and the privileges of Sorin
Hall. Where the offence is gross the forfeiture is permanent ;
but where relieved by mitigating circumstances, it may be only
temporary.	;
The rules governing students at Sorin Hall are found liberal	:
enough by all who earnestly desire to work, to be manly and	?
honorable, to be temperate and industrious to be pure in speech	I
and above reproach in conduct But for such as do not seek to	j
conform to that standard in the general tenor of their lives, or do
not endeavor to square their actions in accordance with it, the ‘
discipline will soon be found sufficiently stringent to prevent
their remaining as inmates of the building.
The advanced students referred to as entitled to quarters at
Sorin Hall comprise young men of the Senior and Junior years
in the classical, scientific, or any other regular course of a
university curriculum. When a student has attained to that
rank in educational proficiency, whether he has studied here or I
elsewhere, he is entitled without extra charge to a room and 1
the privileges of Sorin Hall. There he may remain until he
finishes, or as long afterward as he wishes, should he desire to
pursue post-graduate studies. The same rule applies to students
of the Junior or the Senior year, or to post-graduates, who desire
to study law.
Sometimes young men of unexceptionable habits—young men
who, though of a lower grade than the Junior year in studies,
are nevertheless models of industry and studiousness—earnestly
desire to have rooms and to share the privileges of Sorin Hall.
A certain number of these may be accommodated upon payment
of Jioo yearly. The number who can thus be accommodated
must necessarily be limited, as but comparatively few rooms •
remain vacant after provision has been made for all entitled to
them under the prescribed rules.

REV. THOMAS E. WALSH, C. S. C.,

The course of study in this Department covers a period of three
years. However, where students are entitled to advanced standing
by reason of previous study, or have been actually engaged in the
practice of law, one or two years of faithful work may enable
them to complete the course. And so where they have studied a
year or two in other law schools. While it is desirable that three
years should be given to the prosecution of legal studies before
seeking admission to the bar, yet persons who attend all the lectures
and exercises of the course and diligently apply themselves to the
discharge of the duties devolving upon them may finish in two
years.
The regular course comprises three years. The student in it
must be at least 17 years of age. He must have a fair general
education and be able accurately to write the English language.
A preliminary examination may be resorted to as a means of ascer-
taining his standing in that regard. Once he has been admitted
to the course he may attend at his option any of the collegiate
classes.
The other course comprises a period of two years. The stand-
ard of qualifications for graduation is practically the same in both
courses. The shorter course is designed more particularly for the
LAW DEPARTMENT.	I09
accommodation of students who have reached or passed the age of
18 years and acquired not only a good general education, but also
an accurate knowledge of the English language. Students of the
two years’ course must apply themselves chiefly to the study of
law. A proper performance of the duties devolving upon them
leaves but little time for other studies.
With the exception of collegiate graduates, whose general edu-
cation is presumably finished, all young men about to enter upon
the study of law should endeavor to take the three years’ course.
Knowing how comprehensive the study of law is, and how
available all branches of human knowledge may be made in its
practice, the officers of the University aim to afford law students
special advantages—all reasonable and approved facilities—in the
work of qualifying themselves for the legal profession. Conse-
quently students of the Law Department may, without additional
expense, enter the classes and pursue the studies of the classical
and scientific courses. They may study the natural and physical
sciences, civil and mechanical engineering, mathematics, surveying,
rhetoric, literature, elocution, logic, philosophy, ancient and modern
languages, and the like, in connection with the law. In these
classes they have the same privileges and are subject to the same rules
as the other students.
It has been demonstrated that students of the sophomore or
junior year in the classical and scientific courses may enter with
advantage upon the study of law, attending daily at least one of
the lectures. In such instances students have been able to qualify
themselves for graduation and admission to the bar in from three
to four years. In other words, they have been able to finish the
law either contemporaneously with their graduation in the col-
legiate course or within a year afterward.
Students who do not intend to practice law or become candidates
for the degree of LL. B., but wish simply to complete their educa-
• tion by adding to their acquirements a knowledge of legal prin-
ciples, may at any proper time during the year have their names
enrolled upon the list of students in the Law Department. No
extra expense is thereby entailed. However, such students must
be sufficiently advanced in age and education to justify the belief
that' they can understand and appreciate instruction in the law.
The number of students of this class is likely to increase steadily,
for year by year it is becoming more and more manifest that an
education in our time is not complete without a knowledge of at
least the elementary principles of the law. Many a business man
has had to face financial ruin on account of want of acquaintance
with the law. Many a person has by an inconsiderate act due to
his ignorance of the law forfeited claim to the protection of the
IIO	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
courts and the vindication of his rights. Many a person has been
compelled to do exactly the contrary of what he intended through
his failure to understand the essential elements of a contract.
Many a one has been compelled to pay heavy damages for per-
sonal injuries caused by negligence, or failure to perform a duty,
or improper performance of it, where no liability would exist if
the “law of torts” had been known and observed. As the law is
over and around every creature from the first moment of his being
until the grave has closed upon him, it would be impossible to
overestimate its utility and importance. Indeed, there is no study
that can at all compare with it in practical utility, in training the
mind to accuracy of observation, in enlarging the sphere of the
common sense and guiding it to wisdom of plan and effectiveness
in action, in strengthening the judgment and directing it to intel-
ligent discrimination in* the whole wide range of secular affairs.
Without a knowledge of at least the elementary principles of the
law education in our day can hardly be pronounced complete.
The Chief Methods of Instruction
in the Law Department consist in the delivery daily of two
lectures, the taking of copious notes of the same by the students,
the subsequent reading by them of the decisions cited in the notes,
the study of the standard elementary text-books, the analysis and
recitation in substance at least of the most important leading cases,
oral examinations daily and written examinations weekly, the trial
of actions at law aud suits in equity in the Moot-Court, debates
and exercises in public speaking at least once a week. One of the
professors presides* as jud^e of the Moot-Court and chairman of
the society meetings. The Moot-Court is regularly organized,
having the necessary officers, such as judge, clerk, prosecuting
attorney, sheriff, bailiff, reporters, etc. Pleadings are filed and
actions or suits begun in as close accordance as possible with the
practice of the county, State and Federal courts.
Three classes are taught daily. Two hours are devoted to the
lectures, while one hour is given to “ quizzing ” and recitations..
Wednesday and Saturday evenings are devoted to society and
Moot-Court proceedings. Students take full notes of the lectures.
These cover the whole domain of the law and state princi-
ples pithily and intelligibly. They state what seem to
be the correct or established rules and avoid the contra-
dictions that perplex so many students. They are deemed highly
valuable not only in preparing for examination, but also in subse-
quent practice, as4he latest decisions are often found cited in them.
In the “ quiz ” class it is sought by question and answer to cover the
LAW DEPARTMENT.	Ill
whole ground of the law. Questions bearing upon every branch
and phase of it are put to the students during the two or three
years of their course, and almost necessarily they become familiar
not only with them, but also with the proper answers. Hence the
ground is covered, ist, by the lectures ; 2d, by the study of the
notes aud the reading and the analysis of important decisions ;
3d, by the .study of the best elementary text-books, lists of which
may be had from the professor ; 4th, by daily examinations or
“quizzes.” These “quizzes” are exceptionally instructive and
interesting. They are conducted orally— in conversational style.
They are not conducted with a view to puzzling or confusing the
students. On the contrary, the aim is to make everything clear
and intelligible to them. Moreover, they are invited to ask the
examiner for information upon any and every topic that may seem
in any way obscure to them. At certain times adjudicated cases
of special importance are analyzed and explained. The rise,
development and organization of courts likewise receive due atten-
tion. The common law and code methods of beginning an action,
filing the pleadings, joining issue, impaneling the jury, examin-
ing witnesses, applying the rules of evidence, preparing instruc-
tions, receiving the verdict, moving for a new trial, arguing the
motion for it, taking the case to a higher court on appeal, preparing
the record, abstract and brief, and doing all things necessary in the
’ management of a trial, are fully described and exemplified. Mat-
ters that could not profitably be treated at length in the lectures,
« with the requisite variety of illustrations and qualifications, are
; taken up and considered with due particularity at “ quiz.” Hypo-
thetical cases involving the principles that students find it most
' difficult to master are frequently submitted, analyzed and explained.
•’	The questions and answers cover all the most important principles
।	stated in the notes, but the range of the “ quiz ” is broader in
certain directions than the notes. Nothing is overlooked which
i may legitimately be made the subject of a question in the exami-
■	nation for admission to the bar. It is evidently due in no small
1	measure to this fact that the graduates of this Department have
been so exceptionally successful in their examinations. Certain it
1 is that no law school in the country has a more creditable record
than Notre Dame in that regard. However, the Supreme Court
1 of Indiana has adopted a rule providing for the admission of grad-
i nates of this Department on motion, or without examination.
Under this rule they may present themselves before the court
■ and receive certificates of admission to the bar. They are likewise
; admitted on motion to the bar of the Federal courts. It is
’ required, however, that applicants for admission to the bar in this
:	State shall be voters.
112	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
i
The Common Law	\
I
is taught primarily at Notre Dame. That is the law generally	j
prevalent throughout the Union. It addresses itself to almost all	■
the relations of life. In fact, about 19 out of every 20 cases tried
in our courts are decided in accordance with its principles. It is '
generally uniform in its operation. However, the statutory enact-
ments of State Legislatures overcome and displace it so far as they 3
conflict with it. These enactments differ materially in different j
States, owing to unlike conditions and local differences. Thus it !
is that the laws of certain States are so radically unlike the laws of «
other States. Of course, there are instances in which statutes are	1
passed to cover acts and conditions not provided for by the common	J
law ; but in most instances the existing statutes qualify, displace or '
render inoperative some rules of the common law. The repeal of
statutes having this effect restores the common law rules to their ;
former force and efficacy. In view of these facts, thorough in-
struction is here given in the common law. Neither lawyers nor I
judges pretend to know the statutes of any other State than that in :
which they practice or preside. Moreover, no court pretends to
take judicial cognizance of or know the statutes of any other	?
State than that in which it has its being and jurisdiction. In fact	J
a knowledge of the statutes of different States would be more
confusing and bewildering than profitable to judge, lawyer and	’s
student. In an examination for admission to the bar in any State	-
of the Union no question is put and nothing is said relative to the
statutes of any other State. There are, however, certain funda-	j
mental statutory enactments that exist without material diversity in	•
their scope and purpose in almost all the States. Again, other	•
statutes somewhat less important and fundamental in character	*
exist in groups of States. Such statutes as these may profitably be	*
studied in class, in connection with the common law ; but it would	'•
be worse than useless for a student to attempt to investigate and
study the mazes of statutory differences in the several States.
Hence it is recommended as advisable for each student to bring	:
with him when he comes here in September to pursue the study	/
of law a copy of the revised statutes of his own State or of the '
State in which he proposes to practice the profession.	j
In the Matter of Expenses	|
no discrimination is made between law students and the students 2
of the regular collegiate courses. Board, lodging, tuition, washing, J
mending of linens, etc., cost $150 per session, or $300 for the two
LAW DEPARTMENT.	II3
sessions or ten months comprising the scholastic year. Isolated as
Notre Dame is, students enjoy immunity from the distractions and
temptations of city life and need incur no noteworthy expenses
aside from those stated. They live in an atmosphere of study, and
every incentive and feeling of emulation aroused in them tends to
the formation of studious habits. Thus their work is rendered
particularly effective. It has often been demonstrated that no-
where else do students accomplish more work in a given time.
This fact is not to be overlooked in considering the matter of
expense. In order to maintain this salutary state of things the
same rules of discipline apply to all students, whether in the Law
Department or in the collegiate courses. Free access may be had
at reasonable hours not only to the Lemonnier Library, but also to
the Law Library. This contains all the standard text-books and
reports. Every decision rendered for several years in the State,
Territorial and Federal courts may be found in the Law Library.
Consequently students need purchase but very few law-books. In
this regard they are specially favored, for at other law schools the
item of books alone for each student frequently amounts to from
$100 to $300.
Young men eligible to begin the study of law may be matricu-
lated as students of this Department at any time during the year.
They are charged only from the date of entrance. However, it is
advisable to enter at or near the beginning of the session. Students
in the graduating year are known as Seniors. The others are
called Juniors. All law students, whether Seniors or Juniors, whose
general education is sufficiently advanced to place them on a footing
with students of the Senior or Junior class in the collegiate course,
are entitled to free rooms in Sorin Hall. Other young men of
unexceptionable habits may likewise have rooms for themselves, if
they so desire, but an extra charge of $50 per session is made in
such cases. For further information upon this subject reference
may be had to the article on “ Sorin Hall.”
A CP 0 st = Graduate Course
for law students has recently been established. Graduates may
return at any time and enter upon the studies of this course. By
devoting a year to the work prescribed and passing the examination
they become entitled to the degree of Master of Laws. They are
given free rooms and have all the rights and privileges of other
post-graduates. The course of instruction consists mainly in the
analytical study and writing of pleadings, the examination of
witnesses, the taking of depositions, the trial of actions at law and
suits in equity, the practical application of rules of evidence, the

preparation of briefs and arguments for the higher courts, the study
of leading cases, practice from time to time in what is popularly
called “ office-work,” daily participation in the exercises of the
“ quiz class,” a comparative study of the legislation of different
countries, and the influence of the civil law upon the development
of modern jurisprudence. It is believed that, the student who
finishes this course and reads carefully the revised statutes of his
State will be qualified to enter at once upon the practice of law.
QEvery student who is a candidate for the degree of Bachelor of
Laws or Master of Laws is required to write at least six weeks
before graduation
A Thesis
upon some legal topic selected by himself. It should not be less
than 40 folios in length. The writer is expected to read the thesis
at a special meeting of the class and to defend the propositions set
forth in it. Having read and defended it successfully, he places it
in the hands of the Dean of the Faculty, whose approval it must
have. If it be not meritorious in matter, form and style, the
student may forfeit the right to be considered a candidate for
graduation until the following year and the submission by him of
a satisfactory thesis.
In Conclusion
it may be stated that nowhere can the study of law be more profit-
ably pursued than at Notre Dame. The diligent student may here
qualify himself to pass the most rigid examination in any State.
He may lay broad and deep the foundation of his legal knowledge
and fit himself to become notable in the profession and worthy of
its honors.
Students here have a decided advantage over those of some
other law schools, in that they are not so numerous as to make the
Law Class unwieldy and cumbersome. It is hardly noticed in
some places who does or who does not attend class, and the relative
standing of the students is often quite unknown to the professors.
So numerous are they that the books of even a vast library would
be inadequate for their use. Fifty or more of them may desire to
refer to and read the same book at the same time. Taking moot-
court cases in turn, they can hardly try before the professors
more than one or two in the year. They may not be required to
answer each on an average more than one question a week. They
receive little or no practical instruction. Left almost wholly to
themselves in the choice of methods of study, it is not remarkable
that there should be an absence of system in the work they do, nor

is it singular that many of them utterly fail to make substantial
progress. Such evils almost inevitably attend the work of in-
structing a class very large, unwieldy and cumbersome. More-
over, a large corps of professors would be requisite in such case.
And who does not know that the larger the corps of professors the
more difficult for them to act in unison, to avoid repetition, to cover
the law in its entirety, to understand readily and work effectively
to overcome the peculiar weaknesses and drawbacks of each student?
Law students at Notre Dame have none of these evils to contend
against. Here each member of the class comes frequently in con-
tact with the professors and becomes well known to them. He is
directed and aided in his work. He is required to attend class
regularly and to obey in his deportment and the discharge of his
duties certain prescribed rules of discipline — rules of discipline
deemed necessary for his welfare. Thus he may be strengthened
at every weak point. Thus he may be rounded out into sym-
metrical and useful manhood. Thus may his plastic character
be formed in the mold of honor and impressed with the noble traits
and admirable qualities of gentleman, scholar and lawyer.
College of Mechanical Engineering and the
Mechanics’ Arts.
The buildings of this college were erected on the most approved
plans, after a study of the,best institutions of the kind at home and
abroad. Convenience, ventilation, and an abundance of light are
provided for in all the rooms. The main building is 107 feet long by
40 feet wide and three stories high. To the rear of this is a building
70 feet long by 30 feet wide and one story high, used as a foundry
and blacksmith-shop. The old machine-shop serves as a mechanical
laboratory, and consists of two rooms: the one 50 feet long and 20
feet wide, the other 30 feet long and 20 feet wide.
The college is divided into three principal departments: that of
Theoretical and Experimental Engineering, the department of Prac-
tical Mechanics, and the department of Machine Drawing and Design.
I	.—Engineering D epartment.
This department is divided into two principal sections : that of the
class-room or Theoretical Engineering, and that of the Mechanical
Laboratory or Experimental Engineering.
(1)	Section of Theoretical Engineering. — The course of studies
in the class-room during the Junior Year comprises the subjects of
Materials of Construction, Kinematics or Mechanical Movements,
and the Principles of Machine Design. The study of the materials of
construction in the class-room is supplemented in the laboratory by
testing and examination of the various ores, metals, and woods. The
principles of Kinematics and Machine Design are illustrated by models
in the lecture-room and further explained in the drawing room.
The Senior Year is devoted to the study, by text-book and lecture,
of Thermodynamics, the Theory of the Steam Engine and other
motors, the construction and operation of boilers and pumps. A
graduating thesis and drawing, and a specimen of shopwork are
required of each candidate for a degree at the close of the year.
(2)	Section of Experimental Engineering. — This department is
devoted to calorimetry and the standardization of instruments; the ad-
justing and operation of prime movers, boilers and pumps, with precise
measurements of their power and efficiency; the testing of the strength
and properties of the materials of construction, the metals, woods, oils,
etc. The purpose of this course is not only to familiarize the student
with the apparatus employed but to teach him some of the methods of
research and prepare him for the prosecution of original investigations.
II	.—Department of Practical Mechanics.
This department is divided into four sections: Wood-working,
Foundry Work, Blacksmithing, and Machine-shop Work.
COLLEGE OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.	117
(1)	Section of Wood-working.—This section comprises three courses :
1 st, the course in Joinery, in which the student is taught the use
and care of hand tools, the making of joints and parts of structures,
and the best methods of laying off and executing the most familiar
operations of the joiner and carpenter; 2d, the course of Wood-
Turning, in which he learns the use of the lathe and acquires a fair
degree of skill in working to measurement; 3d, the course of Pattern
Making, which is a combination of the other two for mechanical pur-
poses. The machine tools used in this course, besides the lathes, are
the scroll saw, the planer, the saw bench, and universal trimmer. o
(2)	Section of Foundry Work. — In this course the student is
given a variety of graded patterns to model, sufficient to give him
dexterity and acquaintance with the tools and methods most common
in practice. He then learns to charge the cupola and pour success-
fully ; and dually studies crucible melting and the mixing of metals in
the brass furnace.
(3)	Section of Blacksmithing. — This course is intended to famil-
iarize the student with the behavior of iron and steel when worked
under heat, the best conditions for forming and welding, and the
proper method of making and tempering tools for use in the forge-
room and machine-shop. It also gives him a dexterity that will be of
value in the following course.
(4)	Section of Machine-Shof Work.—The exercises of this course
are graded and designed to illustrate the use of the tools rather than
for purposes of market or further use. The tools employed are the
lathe, planer and shaper, drill-press, milling-machine, grinding appa-
ratus, etc., such as are most commonly met in general practice.
III.—Courses in Machine Drawing.
Instruction in this course begins with free-hand sketching of the
parts of machines some of which may afterwards be made to scale.
Linear drawing and the use of instruments follow; and the principles
of descriptive geometry are taught until the student can work with
certainty and precision. Students in the courses of kinematics and
machine design study on the drawing-board more fully the details of
mechanisms and the relations of connected parts. This is done under
the direction of the instructors in those branches, who also assist in
thesis work and the designing of complete machines. Tracing, blue-
printing, coloring, and the conventionalities of drawing are practiced
extensively. Many of the prints are used in the shops, thus rendering
the work more interesting and instructive.
Special Courses.
Those who do not take the course of Engineering may, if recom-
■ mended by the Director of Studies, enter the shops for a course in
manual training or for the purpose of acquiring skill in practical
mechanics.
The “Notre Dame Scholastic”
is the title of a neat 24-page paper, devoted to the interests of the
students, which is published at the University every week during
Term time. This journal opens a field for young writers, who
might otherwise, for want of a proper medium, allow their talents
to remain inactive.
The Scholastic contains articles of an instructive and literary
character, interesting Biographical sketches, Essays, Poetry, Notes
on Art, Music, Science and Literature, Notes of New Publications,
etc., etc.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic has a local
importance for students, their parents, and all who have attended
class at the University in times past, on account of the weekly
summary of events transpiring at Notre Dame, personal notices of
former students, Rolls of Honor, Class Honors, List of Excellence,
etc., which appear in its columns every week. Reports relative to
the arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented and
energetic students, etc., also find a place in this paper, and keep
parents and others informed on all that concerns their children and
friends.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the coming year
to merit the encourgement given the paper in the past, and the
encomiums bestowed upon it by the press in general.
