In the year 1836, the Rev. S. T. Badin, of venerable memory, -while travel-
ing through the northern section of the State of Indiana, visited the spot now
known by the name of “Notre Dame but, then, lying unnoticed in its native
forest wilderness and beauty. Struck by its loveliness, or, to speak more
correctly, influenced by that Providence which directs the most apparently
unimportant events for the accomplishments of its own eternal designs, Father
Badin resolved at once to secure this place to the Church as the site of a future
College. This resolution he executed: not long after, it passed into the hands
of the Right Rev. Bishop de La Hailandiere, who transferred it. to the Very
Rev. E. Sorin, Priest ot the Society of the Holy Cross, who with a few Bro-
thers of the same Society had come to America about a year before. In 1844,
they first took possession of it, and in a few years were enabled, by the bless-
ing of God, to erect spacious College Buildings which have been year after
year, much enlarged and furnished with various modern improvements, such
as “steam heating apparatus, cold and warm baths, and gymnasiums.”
This Institution was incorporated by an act of the State Legislature of In-
diana, in 1844, under the name and style of “ University of Notre Dame,” and
empowered to confer Degrees in all the learned Professions.
The University of Notre Dame is situated in the lovely valley of the St.
Joseph, scarcely a mile from that river, and on the banks of two beautiful
lakes of clear spring water. It is in the midst of a fine and healthy farming
region, and by means of two great trunk lines of Railroad—the Michigan
Central and the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana, the latter passing
within a mile of the College grounds—is easily and quickly accessible from
every part of the County. At the Southern Michigan Railroad Depot, at South
Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained. Besides this, a
stage passes the College twice a day, connecting the two lines of Railroad. In
the town itself, there is a large and commodious hotel where every comfort
may be enjoyed.
The University is conducted by the Fathers of the Society of the Holy Cross;
a number of highly competent Lay Professors assist in the various branches
of Studies; other Teachers and the Prefects of Discipline are supplied by the
6

Brothers of the Holy Cross, who are, like the Fathers, devoted by their sacred
calling, to the education and instruction of youth.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve the
most perfect order and regularity. The morals and the general deportment of
Pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal habits
receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own families.
Only conciliatory means of correction are used, but if any Student proves in-
sensible to these, he is promptly dismissed from the College.
The tables of honor, weekly notes, monthly certificates, quarterly Bulletins,
semi-annual examinations, annual distribution of premiums, are among the
many means made use of to excite emulation and love of study in the minds
of Pupils, and reward the diligent.
Experience constantly proves that a young man may be kept within the line
of duty more by a sense of honor and justice, than by fear of punishment.
Catholic parents may rest assured that the most zealous care will be taken
that their children comply regularly with their religious duties, and that no
efforts will be spared in instructing them fully in the principles and obligations
of their holy Religion.
Although all the members of the Faculty and other College officers profess
the Catholic Religion, Students belonging to any other denomination are re-
ceived; nothing is required of them, in this respect, but to assist, for uni-
formity’s sake, at all the public and regular exercises of Religion with pro-
priety and decorum.
The Pupils are divided according to their age, into the Minim, Junior and
Senior Departments, each having its separate dormitory, study-hall, class-
rooms, play-grounds, etc., its own complete Gymnasium, with its own prefects
and teachers.
The Institution possesses a valuable Library of about seven thousand
volumes, besides three other small Libraries for the use of the different Col-
lege Societies, a complete set of Philosophical and Chemical Apparatus, a
Museum, of Natural History, and a rich Collection of Pldnts. Among the
peculiar advantages which this Institution presents, as a place of Education,
may be noticed—

1	.—Its Retired Location —At a time and in a country where serious and
solid studies are rare; where dissipations of every kind are thrown in the way
of the young Student; where visitors often interrupt the course of the scho-
lar; and where morals are but slightly watched over, it seems that every
parent who desires to secure to his son an opportunity of spending the few
years of his education usefully and profitably, and passing safely the danger-
ous season of early youth, removed from all the temptations of our large cities,
should readily comprehend the advantage of placing him in such an Institu-
k
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.

tion as Notre Dame. Here, the young student is under the most watchful and
paternal care—here he can apply himself, undisturbed, to his studies, under
competent professors—and, may acquire a solid knowledge of everything to
which he may wish to devote his attention—here, also, his young mind breathes
an atmosphere of piety, the influences of which will hover around him through-
out his life.
2	.—Its Extensive Grounds.—If Students are here deprived of hurtful
pleasures and dissipations which abound in large cities, they are amply remu-
nerated by those delightful and innocent amusements which the nature of this
locality so abundantly provides. Nearly one thousand acres of land are at-
tached to the College, and are well laid out, both by nature and art, for Col-
lege purposes. Whilst the moral and intellectual culture of the Students is
attended to with all possible care and solicitude, their physical development is by
no means neglected. Two ball-alleys, two ten-pin alleys, three gymnastic ap.
paratuses, lately built with much ingenuity and skill, together with a variety
of the latest and most interesting games, viz.: foot-ball, cricket, etc., tend
alike by their judicious use to invigorate the body and recreate the mind.
Moreover, the extensive forests surrounding the College give the best oppor-
tunities to those who are fond of hunting, whilst the two beautiful Lakes,
upon whose banks the University stands, afford choice fishing grounds and
baths in summer, and almost uninterrupted skating during winter. No one
can for a moment doubt, that those manly sports are highly conducive to the
health and happiness of the Pupils. All Educators know that innocent, exhi-
larating and somewhat exciting amusements are the best safeguard of morals
for children—especially for young men.

3	.—The Care taken in Sickness.—Students, when ill, have not to remain
in the College Rooms, but are immediately transferred to the apartments of
the Infirmary, where they are attended and nursed, with devoted care, by ex-
perienced Sisters, who never suffer them to be alone, but strive to supply the
place of their absent mothers. An eminent and experienced Physician—a
graduate of the “Ecole de M^decine” of Lyons, France—resides permanently
in the College.
The last Scholastic year^lras been marked with a success unprecedented in
the annals of the Institution:—the number of Pupils, both here and at St.
Mary’s Academy, exceeded by over one-third that of any former year.
The different departments have likewise been more fully developed both in
reference to classes and discipline. The Faculty is also more efficient and more
numerous than ever before.

Students are not allowed to keep money in their possession : whatever pocket
money parents may choose to allow to their sons must be placed in the hands
of the Treasurer of the Faculty, who will give it out as prudence may suggest
or occasion require.
No Student will be received for a shorter period than one session of five
months The most eligible time for entering is at the beginning of the scho-
lastic sessions in September and February, but Pupils are admitted at all times
during the year, and their session commences with the date of their entrance.
When Parents wish to have their children sent home, they must give timely
notice, settle all accounts, and supply means to defray all traveling expenses.
Should a Student withdraw himself or be withdrawn by his parents or guar-
dians before the expiration of the session, no deduction is made, except in
cases of sickness or dismissal.

The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and closes
on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the confer-
ring of Degrees and the Distribution of Premiums take place. It is divided
into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each Session, a
strict examination of all the different classes is made in the presence of the
Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is exa-
mined by the Prefect of Studies, and placed in that class for which his pre-
vious attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends on
his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be found
capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted and such promotion
is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their classical course, and passed successfully a strict
examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates of
the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to literary or scien-
tific Studies.
Diplomas will be given to those Students who shall have completed the Com-
mercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of Exa-
miners, and given clear evidence of their moral character.
Students who do not desire to graduate, may adopt a partial or irregular
course, fitting them for commercial life, for civil engineering, &c , or for any
pursuit outside of the learned professions, which requires a special training.
Such a course would run parallel with the regular course, and would include
all the advantages, literary and otherwise, which the Institution offers to its
inmates in common.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French and
German languages. Not only are these languages taught very carefully by
persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the Insli-
tution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times occur
for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
All letters sent or received by Students may be opened and read by the Pre-
sident or his substitute.

15th. On the first Wednesday of every month, “Certificates of Good Con-
duct” and of “Improvement in Class” are issued by the Faculty to such Stu-
dents as deserve them. On either side of the President’s table, and conspicu-
ous to every visitor, are the “ Tables of Honor,” presided over by the Vice-
President and the Prefect of Discipline. At these are seated twenty-two of
the Students whose conduct has been most exemplary during the preceding
week. They are elected by the unanimous vote of the Professors and Prefects.
I
16th. In winter, on Saturday, at 4 o’clock, P. M., the Students must wash
their feet. In summer, this regulation is rendered unnecessary by the rule

Lake.

17th. On. Sunday and Wednesday mornings, the Students must place upon
their beds, wrapped up in a bag, their soiled linen of the previous half week.
On Monday morning, the Students of the Senior and Junior Departments re-
pair, in ranks and in silence, to their Dormitories, whence they take their
Sunday clothes, and carry them to their trunks. And on Saturday, at half-
past three o’clock, they go in the same manner to the Trunk Room, and bring
their Sunday clothes to their Dormitories. The pupils of the Minim Depart-
ment change as often as they find a change on their beds. The Sisters take
charge of their wardrobe. The Students will be reviewed at eight o’clock on
Sunday and Wednesday mornings, with special reference to their personal
neatness.
i
J
18th. Stationery, &c., will be delivered to Students, as follows: On Mon-
days and Thursdays, at half-past twelve o’clock, to the Students of the Senior
Department; and on Tuesdays and Fridays, at the same hour, to the Students
of the Junior Department. Every Student should have a memorandum book
in which to enter all his receipts and expenditures, and his notes for recitation
in class, and for conduct during his stay in College. Books prepared expressly
for this purpose can be obtained from the Secretary.

s
19th. Students who may have failed to give satisfaction in the Class Room,

examined and approved by the Prefect of Studies, Objectionable books found
in the possession of Students, will be withheld from them until their depar-
ture from the University.

N. B. The happiness, no less than the improvement of Students, is so
closely connected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the College,
that, no young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own welfare and
the accomplishment of his purpose in entering the Institution, can fail to dis-
cover the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing Rules If the
Authorities of the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere and unwavering
zeal in keeping those Regulations, they demand of Students nothing more than
the promotion of their own interest.

In this Department, conducted by the Brothers of the Holy Cross,
boys are taught several useful trades, and receive, at the same time, a
good, common English education. They are constantly under the
vigilant and paternal care of skillful Brothers, who devote their lives
and energies to the noble task of preparing the children of the labor-
ing class to become good Christians and useful members of society.
The Manual Labor School has been recently much improved. The
building and the different shops have also been considerably enlarged
to meet the demands of the increasing number of applicants.
CONDITIONS FOR ADMISSION.
1st. Each applicant must have attained the age of twelve years,
and shall remain until he is twenty-one; (at eighteen, the period
when a youth is supposed to have become master of his trade, he
begins to enjoy the fruits of his industry, and from this time forward
receives wages for his labor.)
2d.
3d.
He must pay a fee of one hundred dollars on entering.

This Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of
the river St. Joseph, is every thing that could be desired, as a locality,
for a Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete
education are taught here,—Music especially, both vocal and instru-
mental, and the Modern Languages, form prominent features in the
Course of Instruction.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, and furnished with all
the modern Improvements—steam heating, baths, &c.
The Grounds are very extensive, and handsomely ornamented.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other, is a great con-
venience to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons
and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are
referred to the Ninth Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy for
1863-4.
