rpHIS University was founded in 1842 by the Congregation of the Holy
Cross, under the direction of Very Rev. E. Sorin, and was chartered by
the Legislature of the State of Indiana in 1844, with power to confer all the
usual degrees.
The College buildings are on an eminence, near two small, picturesque
lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of the fine and healthy farming region
of the St. Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the river. The College
can easily be reached from all parts of the United States and Canada, by
means of three great trunk lines of Railway,—the Lake Shore & Michigan
Southern, the Chicago & Lake Huron, and the Great Western & Michigan
Central; the former passing within a mile of the College grounds, and Ilie
latter connecting at Niles with the recently-built Railway between that place
and South Bend, which runs 'within half a mile of the College. At the
Michigan Southern Railroad depot, South Bend, omnibuses or private con-
veyances can be obtained.
The buildings are'-well adapted for the purpose for which they were
erected. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleeping Apartments,
and Recreation-Halls are commodious, and capable of giving accomodation to
five hundred resident Students.
THE SITE
of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the Students.
It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot naturally
beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution;—a description of all that
pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limits of these pages.
We prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons, and to all 'who think
of confiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from
THE RETIRED POSITION
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart the
education of their children; and even the careless student when once inter-
ested in his studies soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an unin- •
terrupted attention to class and study. Though secluded in a great measure
from the busy world without, yet the number of Students and the extensive
College grounds give him a world of his own, in which, what with Class,
Examination, Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Baseball Clubs,
Boat-Clubs, Dramatic and Musical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment
and amusement, and companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	9
liis mind on. his studies and establish him in habits of piety, application and.
order—the influence of which will be felt during his entire life. He breathes
for a few short years the atmosphere of order, of regularity in all that he does;
of profound, application to studies, broken only by healthy and regular recre-
ation; and certainly, in our times, when serious and solid studies are becom-
ing so rare, when all kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time
are forced upon young Students, when morals are so lightly watched over,
the advantage of the retired locality of Notre Dawe cannot be too highly
spoken of.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to> health;
and those .who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony
that the regular course of life, added to the salubrious climate and the fresh
country air, has done much to improve the health of their children.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
order and regularity. The morals and general deportment of the pupils are
assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal habits receive the
same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own families.
REGULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
All the Students are required to attend the exercises of public worship
with punctuality and decorum.	.
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful towards the Pro-
fessors and Prefects of the Institution—never absenting themselves from the
place in which they ought to be, without permission from proper authority.
Students must carefully avoid every expression in the least injurious to
eligion or morals, their Professors, Prefects or fellow-Students.
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden to- such as have not permission
from their parents or guardians.
Intoxicating liquors are absolutely prohibited.
Compensation for all damage done to the furniture or other property of
the College will be required from the person or persons causing such damage.
No branch of study, once commenced, shall be discontinued without
permission of the Director of Studies.
No one shall leave the University grounds without fhe permission of the
President or Vice-President.
Bath-rooms, provided with hot and cold water, are fitted up for the use
of the Students during the winter. In warm weather, however, the Students
bathe twice a week in St. Joseph’s Lake.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the Class-room, or wflio
shall have been guilty of misconduct, shall perform such tasks as shall be
assigned them, and will be excluded from all college exercises until such
0	7	O
tasks be accomplished.
No book, periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into the College
without being previously examined and approved by the Director of Studies.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Objectionable books found in the possession of Students will be withheld
from them until their departure from the University.
All letters sent or received by Students may be opened by the President
or his representative.
GENERAL INFORMATION.
The Academic Year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums take place. It is
divided into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each |
Session, a strict examination of all the different classes is made in the ’
presence of the Faculty. There is no vacation at Christmas or Easter.
When a student presents himself for admission into the College, he is
examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which his
previous attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends
on his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be
found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such
promotion is equivalent to Lhe honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully an
examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the Graduates
of the first Degree who shall have devoted at least two years to literary or
scientific studies.	•
The Degree of LL. B., as also those of Bachelor of Science, Master of
Science, and Civil Engineer, will be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their good character.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the
Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times
occur for conversation in these tongues.
©
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitution and
By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the Archconfraternity,
St. Gregory’s Society, Holy Angels’, Holy Childhood,. Philodemic, St.
Edward’s, Thespian, St. Cecilia’s, Columbian, St. Stanislaus Philopatrian,
and Philharmonic Societies, Cornet Band, and two Orchestras, with which
Students are authorized and recommended to connect themselves.
8^° In case of sickness, the Student does not remain in the College
rooms, but is immediately taken to the Infirmary, where he is attended and
nursed with devoted care by experienced Sisters, whose attention to the sick
needs no recommendation.

All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included in the
Course. The Code and Common Law systems of Pleading and Practice are
taught. The Course of Studies in this department embraces, chiefly, Ethics,
Political Economy; Constitutional and International Law; Municipal Law;
Law of Contracts; Equity Jurisprudence; Criminal Law; Evidence, Plead-
ing and Practice.
For the purpose of acquiring a practical as well as a theoretical knowl-
ledge of the legal profession, the students shall be required, during the course-,
to argue cases, draw up pleadings, and conduct Law and Chancery suits ac-
cording to the rules and formalities of regular courts of justice.
As it is a matter of the highest importance to a young lawyer that on
being admitted to the practice of his profession, he should be able to express
himself clearly and fluently, full opportunities will be afforded for cultivating
the art of public speaking. As one means of attaining this end, and for the
purpose of familiarizing the student with the practical workings of his future
profession, Moot Courts, under the direction of a Professor, will be frequently
held during the Course. For the cultivation of other -kinds of eloquence,
still further facilities are afforded in the various Literary and Debating
Societies of the University.
In addition to the general course of instruction, students will receive
every assistance in studying the Laws peculiar to their respective States
The entire course for those just commencing the study of the Law, is
intended to be completed in two years, divided into four terms which corres-
pond with those of the other departments of the University.
Every applicant for admission into this department is expected to have,
at least, a complete English education. It is very desirable that he should
also have a classical training before commencing the study of the Law;
nevertheless, those who may not possess this advantage will, without extra
charge, be afforded ample facilties for acquiring a knowledge of the classics,
while prosecuting their legal studies.
24	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time, but
it is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves at the
beginning of a Term.
The students will be required to pass through an examination at the
close of each Term, and also to present an essay, of not more than seven
pages of legal cap, on some one of the matters which they shall have seen.
The notes of these special examinations and essays, as well as those of the
application and general standing of the members in class throughout the
Law Course, will be placed to their respective credits in the result of the
final examination.for the degree of LL. B.

:MZNTM: DEEATCTArENT.
In this Department are admitted young boys under ten years of age, who
are carefully taught—by highly competant lady teachers—Spelling, Reading,
Writing, and the Elements of English Grammar; Geography, History and
Arithmetic; so as to fit them, after a lapse of time more or less extended, for
the higher branches of study.
(1
Post-Graduate Course.
The want of such a Course has been for a long time felt by Students
desirous of continuing to perfect themselves in those studies which require
several years of close attention. The Post-Graduate Course is now open, and
we invite our Graduates, and such others as are able, to enter it and avail
themselves of the advantages it affords of prosecuting their studies to a suc-
cessful conclusion. The Students in this course occupy themselves with
with Philosophy, History, and the Natural Sciences. Law and Civil En-
gineering may be optional studies of the Course.
Law Department.
We trust to see our Law Department better and better attended year
after year. We have every reason to be proud of the young men who each
year have sought the classic retirement of Notre Dame to pursue their Law
i studies. We will endeavor to make their sojourn among us an agreeable one,
and give them the advantages offered by other Institutions.
Civil Engineering.
This important branch of study will be commenced next Session, and
will afford our advanced students the opportunity long desired of fitting
themselves for important professions in life.
Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame to
promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is so frequent
and necessary for business or scientific purposes.
The German mnguage, the classes of which are so numerously attended,
will be taught by four Professors during the next scholastic year. The num-
ber of German students attending the University is becoming greater every
year.
The French language, though more especially the language of the Colle-
giate Course, will be of great advantage to the Scientific students. Other
languages—such as Italian and Spanish—may be taught when required.
Phonography and Telegraphy.
These two branches invite the special attention of the students of the Com-
mercial Course. The Telegraph Department is fully organized, and placed
under the management of a skilful electrician. It is very probable that
58	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Notre Dame will be in direct communication with South Bend and the rest
of the world by electric wires before the end of 1874.
Anatomy and Materia Medica. •
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find oppor-
tunities to do so at Notre Dame. Yet, owing to the want of a sufficient
museum whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the
course of studies in this Department is limited, and embraces principally
Anatomy. The remainder of the course is completed in some of our neigh-
boring Universities. As a Preparatory Course, that -which is given here,
under Rev. L. Neyron, M. D., leaves nothing to be desired. '
Painting and Drawing.,
The Drawing Classes show each year a large increase on the preceding
years. The University enjoys means adequate to all demands in that branch.
It possesses a large number of models in all sorts of drawings, a fine studio,
and a vigilant and zealous teacher of the art.
Painting promises likewise to be one of the popular branches of Art
taught at Notre Dame. The famous painter Gregori, of Rome, has been
finally engaged, by Very Rev. Father Sorin, to come to Notre Dame in
August. His contract is to last three years. Gregori has no superior in
Rome.
Music.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has five Profes-
sors, and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory system. An
Orchestra of fifteen pieces, with an excellent Quartette, and a Brass Band of
twTenty-five instruments, are some of the leading features of the Musical
Department.
Vocal Music will receive special attention next year. A Professor of
merit will have charge of it. We call the attention of our students and patrons
to this favorite and useful branch of music, which is now so deservedly
popular.
Astronomical Observatory.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which the
fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been placed. The
studies of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered practically interesting.
Libraries.
The College Library contains some twelve thousand volumes, very care-
fully arranged by the Librarian, Rev. Joseph C. Carrier, C. S. C. Donations
of books, especially to the Law Library, will be thankfully received.
The Circulating Library wTas commenced bvo years ago, with four hundred
volumes—it now numbers over twelve hundred. All the Libraries wdiich
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	59
formerly belonged to Literary and Religious Societies have been merged
into it. Instead of the dozen or more bookcases which often only hid away
instructive books, a beautiful'collection of Literary and Religious works is
now open to the students in a room fitted up as a Reading Room.
“THE SCHOLASTIC.”
This is the title of a neat little paper published every week, except in
vacation, at the University of Notre Dame. The chief object of this paper is
to keep the parents and friends of our students informed on the various sub-
jects of study and discipline at this University and at St. Mary’s Academy,
and of the progress of their sons and daughters in these two institutions.
For this purpose, regular weekly reports are given, consisting of the names
of those who deserve, by their excellent conduct, to be recorded on the Roll
of Honor, and who by their perseverance and industry deserve special com-
mendation from their various professors and teachers. Other reports relative
to the arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented and ener-
getic students, etc., also find place in this paper, and keep parents and friends
accurately informed on all that concerns their children.
This paper also opens a field for aspiring young writers, who might
otherwise, through timidity, allow their talents in this respect to remain in-
active; while many articles of an instructive and literary character, from
VTiters of mature mind and ability, render The Scholastic a valuable pub-
lication for all who desire variety and utility in their reading. Our little
College paper at present consists of eight wide two-column pages, and as
soon as a sufficient patronage will justify its conductors in doing so, it will be
increased in size and thus rendered still more useful and interesting. 4

SAINT MARY’S ACADEMY,
(One Mile West of Kotre Baine University.)


HIS Institution, situated on. the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education
are taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the
Modern Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of Catholic
A	O
pupils. Pupils of all denominaations are received, and, for the sake of order,
merely required to attend the public religious exercises with the members of
the Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all modern improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths are
attached to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are re-
ferred to the Nineteenth Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy, for the
year 1873-4, or address
ST. MARY’S ACADEMY,
Notre Dame, Indiana.
N. B. The friends of the Academy will be pleased to learn that there is a
regular omnibus line betweeen South Bend, Notre Dame and St. Mary’s,
which connects regularly with all the trains ariving at South Bend.
