RESIDENCE HALLS
AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
The University provides board and lodging for
most of the members of the faculty and all students
in its own buildings on the campus. This arrangement
draws professors and students into close comradeship
and forms an ideal college community.
There are twTo modes of student life at Notre
Dame—the common room system and the private
room system. Bach has special advantages. In the
common room system the students study in a large
assembly room under constant supervision of a member
of the faculty. They sleep in a high-ceilinged, well
ventilated common room, the beds being screened by
curtains to secure privacy. Lavatories are provided
with stationary wash-stands having hot and cold
running water; a locker is assigned each student for
toilet articles. Recreation rooms are furnished with
billiard tables and pianos. Facilities for bathing—
shower, needle and tub baths and a swimming pool
23x57 feet— are arranged in the University natatorium
directly in the rear of the lavatories. The common
room system is especially adapted to young men who
have not formed fixed habits of study or whose general
character is not well solidified. At least one year of
this manner of living is strongly recommended for all
students.
For the private room system the University has
4
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
three residence halls, known as Sorin, Corby and Walsh.
These form part of the group of the University build-
ings, and all are located within short distances of one
another. Cement walks lead from building to building.
The residence halls are constructed, as are the other
buildings, of cream colored brick with stone trimmings.
Bach hall contains ample protection against fire, and
all are provided with modern fire-escapes. A night
watchman within the buildings regularly patrols these
halls, and another does duty around them on the outside.
No oil lamps, candles or any artificial lights other
than electric are used, and smoking in the rooms is
strictly forbidden. The halls are heated by steam.
The residence halls vary in size. The average
floor space in single bedrooms is 8.6 x 13.9. There are
a number of double rooms in each hall. In Walsh
hall most of the rooms in the front of the building are
in suites, a suite consisting of a bedroom, study and
bath. The ceilings are ten feet high. All the rooms
have outside light and exposure. There are baths
and toilet rooms in all the halls, and each has recreation
rooms for general use, in which are billiard tables and
pianos.
The following furniture is provided for the rooms;
chairs, table, book-shelf, wash-stand, bowl, pitcher,
soap-dish, ward-robe, bedside rug, iron bed with spring
mattress, hair mattress, pillow, double woolen blanket,
quilt, bed-linen and counterpane. In double rooms
there are three chairs and double the number of other
articles. It should be understood that the equipment
named above is of the simplest character: students
usually add to it other articles of furniture at their
own expense.

ADMISSION
The University reserves all rights in the assign-
ment of rooms and shall determine when . they-must
be vacated. Choice of room-mates shall receive the
sanction of the University officers. An accumulation
of 300 demerits for violation of house rules or the
general rules of the University, any single serious
breach of discipline or continued neglect of study will
lead to the forfeiture of rooms. Rooms will be ready
for occupancy on the Monday preceding the opening
of the academic year, and must be vacated on the
Thursday following the annual Commencement.
Definite application for the reservation of rooms
may be made as early as May 1 on application blanks,
a form of which will be found on page 24. Later requests
will be granted so far as possible till the supply runs
out. No reservation will be made unless the applica-
tion is accompanied by a fee of fifteen dollars, which
is demanded as an earnest of serious intention. This
fee will be applied toward defraying the charge for
rental when the student takes possession of his room;
it will be forfeited in case the student does not occupy
his room on the day set for the opening of classes. . ,
Graduate students and those of junior and senior
standing and such sophomore students as can be accom-
modated are assigned to Sorin Hall. All sophomores
who can not be provided with rooms in Sorin reside in
Corby Hall. No room rental, strictly speaking, ' is
charged to post-graduates, seniors, juniors and sopho-
mores, the four hundred dollar charge for board, lodging,
laundry and tuition covering the rent of a room for
an academic year. Fifteen dollars to cover the expense
the care of a room: .for one year is charged to these
er classmen. It should be carefully noted that the
6
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME
free rooms available for students referred to are those to
which is attached a rental of not more than eighty
dollars; where the rental is higher the excess over
eighty dollars is added to the fee for the care
of rooms. Upperclassmen may also secure rooms
in Walsh by paying the full rental. By a special con-
cession freshmen are allowed a rebate of thirty dollars
on the cost of any room in Corby Hall. Attention is
called to the fact that only those students who have
completed all the preparatory studies—who have “no
conditions”—are entitled to the freshman rate. Sim-
ilarly only “unconditioned” sophomores get rooms free.
RULES
All students living in residence halls are sub-
ject to the disciplinary regulations of the University.
Failure to observe these rules entails demerits which
are graded according to the gravity of the offence.
For violation also of the special regulations for the
good order and safety in residence halls demerits are
given. When a student has reached three hundred
demerits he is suspended for a period of about six weeks.
The use of intoxicating liquors will lead in every case
to suspension.
Bach student is held responsible for the furniture
and the general condition of his room; any damage
shall be charged to him.
Meals are not permitted in the rooms. When
students are sick they will be cared for in the Univer-
sity Infirmary.

RATES
The rental charged for rooms, which are all pro-
vided with the necessary furniture enumerated above,
covers one academic year and includes heat, lights,
the care of the room, laundry of bed-linens and towels
and service of bed-linens.
The prices are governed by the size of the rooms,
exposure and location.
The location of the rooms may be ascertained by
reference to the numbers on the floor plans. To facilitate
the reference it may be observed that all the one
hundreds are on the first floor, all the two hundreds on
the second floor, etc., etc.
No rental is charged for rooms in Sorin Hall, in
which upperclassmen reside. A fee of $15.00 for service
must be paid in advance by all students residing in
Sorin Hall and by sophomores who live in Corby Hall.
This refers only to rooms costing eighty dollars or less.
Tor more expensive rooms in Sorin or Corby there is
added to the fee of fifteen dollars the ordinary rental
in excess of eighty dollars.
In Walsh Hall suites for one student consist of
a study, a bedroom and a bath; suites for two students
are composed of one large study, two bedrooms and a
bath; suites for four students comprise two large
studies, one double and two single bedrooms and a
bathroom.
Bach room in the suites has a door leading to the
corridor. The larger suites, may, therefore, be divided
into single and double rooms and into suites for one
student. Prices for rooms thus separated may be. as-
certained by applying to the Secretary of the University.
Some few of the large rooms listed as single rooms
may be occupied by two students. When this arrange-
8
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME
ment is made an additional charge of $15.00 to $25.00
Tor service is annexed to the price of the room.
The regulations governing the payment of residence
hall fees are the same as those that apply to tuition
fees. Payment shall be made in advance. A deposit
of $15.00 must be made when a reservation of a room
is reotuired. This amount is deducted from the rental
when the student takes possession. It will be forfeited
if for any reason a student fails to take the room assigned
to him on the day fixed for the opening of classes.

juniors and seniors. A fee of $15.00 is charged for
