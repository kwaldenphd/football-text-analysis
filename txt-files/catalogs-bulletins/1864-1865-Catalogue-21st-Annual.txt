In the year 1886, the Rev. S. T. Badin, of venerable memory, while travel-
ing through the northern section of the State of Indiana, visited the spot now
known by the name of “ Notre Dame,” butthen lying unnoticed in its native
forest wilderness and beauty. Struck by its loveliness, or to speak more
correctly, influenced by that Providence which directs the most apparently
unimportant events for the accomplishment of its own eternal designs, Bather
Badin resolved at once to secure this place to the Church as the site of a
future College. This resolution he executed. Not long after, it passed into
the hands of the Right Rev. Bishop de la Hailandi^re, who transferred it to
the Very Rev. E. Sorin, Priest of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, who
with a few Brothers of the same Order had come to America about a year
before. In 1844 they first took possession of it, and in a few years were
enabled, by the blessing of God, to erect spacious College buildings, which
have been year after year much enlarged and furnished with all the modern
improvements.
Such has been of late the rapid increase in the number of Students, that
the Board of Administration has felt obliged to throw aside all previous
calculations, and to prepare at once ample room to accommodate fully and
comfortablj7 five hundred boarders. It is to meet every want of that number,
including all the modern improvements of the age, and, in a word, everything
that an experience of a. quarter of a century has shown to be beneficial and
desirable, that the new College building already in progress of erection, and
which will be ready for occupancy before the first of September next, has
been planned. Here are the outlines, viz: one hundred and sixty feet in
length, eighty feet in width, and six stories in height.
From the basement to the top of the building there is the greatest sim-
plicity of divisions or arrangements, rendering all movements and inspection
natural and easy; and in this chiefly consists tlie real benefit of experience.
Here is the division of each floor. In the basement two refectories, eighty
by forty; one for the Seniors in the eastern wing, and the other for the
Juniors in the western wing; the central part, eighty by seventy, is- divided
lengthwise by a large corridor, seventeen feet wide, joining the two dining-
rooms, and having, on either side, a spacious wash-room for each department.
6	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
On. tile -first floor, Iwo study-rooms, same size as the refectories, the same
large corridor between, leaving, on the rear, a third study-room, for the Col-
| legiate Course, eighty by thirty-two; and in front, besides the entrance hall, ! |
। the President’s room on the right, with its parlor; and on the left, the Secre- ! J
tary’s office; both of the easiest access at all times.	■ !j
The second floor is reached bjr a double flight of wide stairs; the corridor |
; goes through and through, from east to west; this is the class floor; it is
; divided into thirteen large class-rooms, and five rooms for Professors on
*
i j the central front,	'
t;	The same symmetrical stairs land us on the third floor; but there the corridor |
i extends only from one v'ing to the other, leading oh the right to the first !
| Dormitory of the Seniors, and on the left to the first one of the Juniors, ?
| each eighty by forty; on the front, in the centre, five rooms for Professors ’ |}
and on the rear, five rooms for Music.	11
1	I '
The fourth floor is precisely a repetition of the third.	;'
The fifth is divided into three large Dormitories, and a Chapel on the front-, i1
From the circular walk around the foot of the dome, a beautiful view of (
‘ the city and vicinity by day, and from within, a clear insight into the !
starry regions at night, will richly repay visitors for the little fatigue of their j
ascension. On the top of the dome, you see the colossal statue of Notre '
Dame, with the brilliant crown of the twelve biblical stars, whilst beneath,
under her foot, lies the figure of the serpent, whose head she crushes. The ! ■
countenance of the Virgin is uplifted, directing all eyes and hearts to j
Heaven. The statue is after the model of the famous monument lately *
v j,
erected by Pio Nono on the Piazza di Spagna, in commemoration of the i i
definition of the Immaculate Conception-.	I:
This Institution was incorporated by an act of the State Legislature of J;
Indiana, in 1844, under the name and style of “University of Notre Dame-,” ’:
and empowered to confer Degrees in 'all the learned Professions.	[;
The University of Notre Dame is situated in the lovely valley of the St. !.
Joseph, scarcely a mile from that river, and on the banks of two beautiful j1
lakes or clear spring water-. It is in the midst of a fine and healthy farming i.
region, and by means of two great trunk lines of Railroad'—the Michigan I ’
Central and the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana, the latter passing ; ■
within a mile of the College grounds—-is easily and quickly accessible from 1:
every part of the country. At the Michigan Southern Railroad Depot, at
South Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained. Besides i
this, a stage passes the College twice a day, connecting the two lines of Rail- J
road. In the town itself there are large and Commodious hotels where every j.
comfort may be enjoyed.	‘
The University is conducted by the Fathers of the Congregation of the i!
Holy. Cross; a number of highly competent Lay Professors assist in the various j
branches of Studies; other Teachers and the Prefects of Discipline are sup-
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.

plied by the Brothers of the Holy Cross, who are, like the Fathers, devoted
by their sacred calling to the education and instruction of youth.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
the most perfect order and regularity The morals and the general deport- |
ment of Pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal *
habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own ' i
families. Only conciliatory means of correction are used; but if any Student |
proves insensible to these, he is promptly dismissed from the College.	’
The Tables of Honor, Weekly Notes, Monthly Certificates, Quarterly Bui- j
letins, Semi-Annual Examinations and Annual Distribution of Premiums are j
among the many means made use of to excite emulation and love of study in ; |
the minds of Pupils and reward the diligent.	{• j
Experience constantly proves that a young man may be kept within the j j
line of duty more by a sense of honor andywtzce, than by fear of punishment, j'
i Catholic parents may rest assured that the most zealous care will be taken J j
• that their children comply regularly with their religious duties, and that no j ■
efforts will be spared in instructing them fully in the principles and obliga- d
j tions of their Holy Religion.	; i
i Although all the members of the Faculty and other College officers profess ’ j
‘ the Catholic Religion, Students belonging to any other denomination are | [
received; nothing is required of them, in this respect, but to assist, for uni- j j
formity’s sake, at all the public and regular exercises of Religion with pro- | >
priety and decorum.	; j
' The Pupils are divided, according to their age, into tile Minim, Junior and j i
, Senior Departments, each having its separate dormitory, study-hall, class- q
■ rooms, play-grounds, etc., its own complete Gymnasium, with its own Prefects , j
! - and Teachers.	;;
I	11
! The Institution possesses a valuable Library of about seven thousand J
' volumes, besides three other small Libraries for the use of the different Col- | i
: lege Societies, a complete set of Philosophical and Chemical Apparatus, a i
i Museum of Natural History, and a rich Collection of Plants. Among the j
J peculiar advantages which this Institution presents, as a place of Education, J
may be noticed—	i
1	.—Its Retired Location—At a time and in a country where serious and j;
solid studies are rare; where dissipations of eveiy kind are thrown in the way j.
of the young Student; where visitors often interrupt the course of the scho- J
lar; and where morals are but slightly watched over, it seems that every
parent who desires to secure to his son an opportunity of spending the few
years of his education usefully and profitably, and passing safely the danger-
ous season of early youth, removed from all the temptations of our large
cities should readily comprehend the advantage of placing him in such an
Institution as Notre Dame. Here, the young student is under the most

8	UNIVERSITY OP NOTRE DAME.
watchful and parental care; here he can apply himself, undisturbed, to his
studies, under competent professors, and may acquire a solid knowledge of
' everything to which he may wish to devote his attention; here, also, his young
mind breathes an atmosphere of piety, the influences of which will hover
around him throughout his life.
2	.—Its Extensive G-bounds.—If Students are here deprived of hurtful
pleasures and dissipations which abound in large cities, they are amply remu-
nerated by those delightful and innocent amusements which the nature of this
locality so abundantly provides. Nearly one thousand acres of land are at-
tached to the College, and are well laid out, both by nature and art, for
College purposes. Whilst the moral and intellectual culture of the Students
is attended to with all possible care and solicitude, their physical develop-
ment is by no means neglected. Two ball-alleys, two ten-pin alleys, three
gymnastic apparatuses, lately built with much ingenuity and skill, together
with a variety of the latest and most interesting games, viz: foot-ball, cricket,
etc., tend alike by their judicious use to invigorate the body and recreate the
mind. Moreover the extensive forests surrounding the College give the best
opportunities to those who are fond of hunting, whilst the two beautiful
Lakes, upon whose banks the University stands, afford choice fishing-grounds
and baths in summer, and almost uninterrupted skating during winter. No
one can for a moment doubt that these manly sports arc highly conducive to
the health and happiness of Pupils. All Educators know that innocent
exhilarating and somewhat exciting amusements are the best safeguard of
morals for children, especially for young men.
8	.—The Case taken in Sickness.—Students, when ill, have not to remain
in the College Rooms, but are immediately transferred to the apartments of
the Infirmary, where they are attended and nursed, with devoted care, by ex-
perienced Sisters, who never suffer them to be alone, but strive to supply the
place of their absent mothers. An eminent and experienced Physician—a
graduate of the “Ecole de MGdecine” of Lyons, France—resides permanently
in the College.
The last Scholastic year has been marked with a success unprecedented in
the annals of the Institution; the number of Pupils, both here and at St.
Mary’s Academy, exceeded by over one-third that of any former year.
The different departments have likewise been more fully developed, both
in reference to classes and discipline. The Faculty is also more efficient and
more numerous than before.

lastic sessions in September and February, but Pupils are admitted at all times
during the year, and their session commences with the date of their entrance.

in cases of sickness or dismissal.
10	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,
The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
Conferring of Degrees and the Distribution of Premiums take place. It is
divided into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each
Session, a strict examination of all the different classes is made in the
presence of the Faculty.	।
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is ;
examined by the Prefect of Studies, and placed in that class for which his ;
previous attainments may have qualified him: His further promotion i
depends on his application and progress. Should any Studeny during the {
year, be found capable of passing to a higher classr he will be promoted, and
such promotion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the .
Students as shall have completed their classical course, and passed successful! v 1
a strict examination before the Faculty.	1
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graAiates I
of the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary or J
Scientific Studies.	i;
Diplomas will be given to those Students who shall have completed W ,
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board c j ‘
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their moral character,	}!
Students who do not desire to graduate, may adopt a partial or irregular ;
course, fitting, them for Commercial life, for Civil Engineering, &e,, or for any 1
pursuit outside of the Learned Professions^ which requires- a special training.
Such a course would run parallel with the regular course,, and would include
all the advantages, literary and otherwise, which the Institution offers to its
inmates in common,	i
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French t
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully !,
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the j
Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities’ at all times ;
occur for conversation in these tongues,	<
O	f
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory |
evidence of their moral standing.
All letters sent and received by Students may be opened and read by tie
President or his substitute.

16th. Tn winter, on Saturday, at 4 o’clock, p. in., the Students must wash

Joseph’s Lake.
17th. On Sunday and Wednesday mornings, the Students must place
upon their beds, wrapped up in a bag, their soiled linen of the previous half
week. On Monday morning, the Students of the Senior and Junior Depart-
ments repair, in ranks and in silence, to their Dormitories, whence they take
their Sunday clothes and carry them to their trunks. And on Saturday, at
half-past three o’clock, they go in the same manner to the Trunk Room, and
bring their Sunday clothes to their Dormitories. The pupils of the Minim
Department change as often as they find a change on their beds. The Sisters
take charge of their wardrobe. The Students will be reviewed at eight
o’clock on Sunday and Wednesday mornings, with special reference to their
personal neatness.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	13
books found in. ike possession of Students, will be withheld from them until
their departure from the University.
N. B. The happiness, no less than the improvement of Students, is so
closely connected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the
College, that no young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own
welfare and the accomplishment of his purpose in entering the Institution,
can fail to discover the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing
Rules. If the Authorities of the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere
and unwavering zeal in keeping these Regulations, they demand of Students
nothing more than the promotion of their own interest.
*** There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions
and By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the St. Vincent
de Paul’s, Arch-Confraternity, St. Aloysius’ Literary and Historical, Holy
Angels, and Philharmonic Societies, with which Students are authorized and
recommended to connect themselves.

(ONE MILE TVEST OF NOTRE LAME UNIVERSITY,)
CONDUCTED BY THE “ SISTERS OE HOLY CROSS.”
--------------
HIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph’s River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are
taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Mod-
ern Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of Catholic pupils.
Pupils of all denominations are received, and for the sake of order merely
required to attend the public religious exercises with the members of the
Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all Modern Improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths
are attached to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion winch is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both when they visit their sons and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are
referred to the “ Tenth Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy,” for the
year 1864-5, or address
MOTHER SUPERIOR,
St. Mary's Academy, Deme P. 0.. Indiana.
N. B.—The friends of the College will be pleased to learn that there is a
regular line of omnibuses between South Bend, Notre Dame and St. Mary’s,
which connect regularly with all the trains arriving at South Bend.
