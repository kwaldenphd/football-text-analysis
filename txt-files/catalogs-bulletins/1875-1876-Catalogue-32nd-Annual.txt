University of Notre Dame.
This University was founded in 1842 by the Congregation of the
Holy Cross, under the direction of Very Rev. E. Sorin, and was char-
tered by the Legislature of the State of Indiana in 1844, with power to
confer all the usual degrees.
The College buildings are on an eminence near two small, pictur-
esque lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of the fine and healthy
farming region of the St. Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the
river. The College can easily be reached from all parts of the United
States and Canada by means of three great trunk lines of railway—
the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, the Chicano and Lake Huron,
and the Great Western and Michigan Central; the former passing
within a mile of the College grounds, and the latter connecting at
Niles with the recently-built railway between that place and South
Bend, which runs within a half mile of the College. At the Michigan
Southern railroad depot, South Bend, omnibuses or private convey-
ances can be obtained.
The buildings are well adapted for the purposes for which they
were erected. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleep-
ing Apartments and Recreation Halls are commodious, and capable of
giving accommodation to five hundred resident students.
THE SITE
of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the
Students. It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering
a spot naturally beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution;—a description of
all that pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limit of
these pages. We prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons,
and to all who think of confiding their sons to our care, to come and
see and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from the
RETIRED POSITION
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at
heart the education of their children; and even the careless student,
- .. rr-Hll - ■ —-----------------------------------------------------------
PROSPECTUS.	9
when once interested in his studies, soon finds out the benefits he can
derive from an uninterrupted attention to class and study. Though
secluded in a great measure from the busy world without, yet the
number of Students and the extensive College grounds give him a
world of his own, in which, what with Class, Examination, Notes,
Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Baseball Clubs, Boat Clubs,
Dramatic and Musical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment and
amusement, and companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to
fix his mind on his studies and establish him in habits of piety, appli-
cation and order—the influence of which will be felt during his entire
life. He breathes for a few short years the atmosphere of order, of
regularity in all that he does; of profound application to studies,
broken only by healthy and regular recreation; and certainly in our
times, when serious and solid studies are becoming so rare, when all
kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time are forced upon
young Students, when morals are so lightly watched over, the advan-
tage of the retired location of Notre Dame cannot be too highly
spoken of.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to
health; and those who have had their sons in the College can give
thdr testimony that the regular course of life, added to the salubrious
clinate and the fresh country air, has done much to improve the
hea;th of their children.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to
preserve order and regularity. The morals and general deportment
of the pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and
personal habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom
of their own families.
THE EDUCATION
given at Notre Dame is calculated to form both the heart and intel-
lect of die Students. Every attention is given to their moral and
religious culture. Every day the Students have an opportunity of
attending classes where they may acquire a knowledge of Christian
Doctrine.*. Twice a week, lectures and instructions on religious topics
are deliveied to all the Students together. Einally, a regular course
of Dogmatic Theology is established in the University for the benefit
| of the mop advanced Students who may desire to enter the world
having theii minds stored not only with profane science, but also with
what is mud, more important—a thorough knowledge of their religion.

IO	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
The religious instruction is, of course, confined to Catholic Students
exclusively. The intellectual training is carried on with care and dili-
gence by the Officers and Professors of the University. The best sys-
tems of teaching are adopted, and the best authors for each branch
selected, so that no pains are spared to secure the objects which the
University has in view as an institution of education.
REGULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
All Students are required to attend the exercises of public worship
with punctuality and decorum.
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful towards
the Professors and Prefects of the Institution,—'never absenting them-
selves from the place in which they ought to be without permission
from proper authority.	'
Students must carefully avoid every expression in the least injuri-
ous to Religion or morals, their Professors, Prefects or fellow Students.
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden, and intoxicating liquors
are absolutely prohibited.
Compensation for all damage done to the furniture or other prop-
erty of the College will be required from the person or persons causing
such damage.
No branch of study, once commenced, shall be discontinued vith-
out permission from the Director of Studies.
No one shall leave the University grounds without the permission
of the President or Vice-President.
Students are expected to take baths regularly.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the Class-Room, or
who have been guilty of misconduct, must perform such tasks as may
be assigned them, and shall be excluded from all College exercises
until such tasks be accomplished.
No book, periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into the Col-
lege without being previously examined and approved by the Director
of Studies. Objectionable books found in the possession o: Students
will be withheld from them until their departure from the University,
or destroyed.
All letters sent or received by Students may be opmed by the
President or his representative.
GENERAL INFORMATION.
The Academic Year commences on the first Tuesdayof September,
and closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Com-
PROSPECTUS.	11
mencement, the Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums
take place. It is divided into two Sessions of five months each. At
the termination of each Session a strict examination of all the different
classes is made in the presence of the Faculty. There is no vacation
at Easter.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College
he is examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for
which his previous attainments may have qualified him. His further
promotion depends on his application and progress. Should any Stu-
dent, during the year, be found capable of passing to a higher class,
he will be promoted, and such promotion is equivalent to the honors
of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the
Students as shall have completed the Classical Course, and passed
successfully an examination in all the branches of the course before
the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the
graduates of the first Degree who shall have devoted at least two years
to literary or scientific studies, and shall have sustained satisfactorily
an appropriate thesis.
The Degree of LL. B., as also those of Bachelor of Science, Master
of Science, and Civil Engineer, will be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the Students who shall have completed
the Commercial Course and passed a satisfactory examination before
the Board of Examiners. In all cases, Students receiving Diplomas
'■are supposed to be of good moral character.
No Student will receive a Diploma or University Honor of any
kind until such time as all indebtedness to the institution shall have
been satisfactorily settled.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the
French and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught
very carefully by persons of acknowledged competency, but, many of
the members of the Institution being natives of France and Germany,
opportunities at all times occur for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satis-
factory evidence of their moral standing.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions
and By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty: such as the Arch-
confraternity, Holy Angels, Holy Childhood, St. Aloysius Philodemic,
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Thespian, St. Cecilia, Columbian, St. Stanislaus- Philopatrian, and
Philharmonic Societies, Cornet Band, and Orchestra, with which Stu-
dents are authorized and recommended to connect themselves.
U3V In case of sickness, the Student does not remain in the College
rooms, but is immediately taken to the Infirmary, where he is attended
and nursed with devoted care by experienced Sisters, whose attention
to the sick needs no recommendation.

All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included in
the Course. The Code and Common Law systems of Pleading and Practice
are taught. The Course of Studies in this Department embraces, chiefly,
Ethics, Political Economy, Constitutional and International Law, Municipal
Law, Law of Contracts, Equity Jurisprudence, Criminal Law, Evidence,
Pleading and Practice.
For the purpose of acquiring a practical as well as a theoretical knowl-
edge of the legal profession, the students shall, during the Course, be required
to argue cases, draw up pleadings, anti conduct Law and Chancery suits
according to the rules and formalities of regular courts of justice.
As it is a matter of the highest importance to a young lawyer that on
being admitted to the practice of his profession he should be able to express
himself clearly and fluently, full opportunities will be offered for cultivating
the art of public speaking. As one means of attaining this end, and for the
purpose of familiarizing the Student with the practical workings of his future
profession, Moot Courts, under the direction of a Professor, will be frequently
held during the Course. For the cultivation of other kinds of eloquence, still
further facilities are afforded in the various Literary and Debating Societies
of the “University.
In addition to the general course of instruction, students will receive
I every assistance in studying the Laws peculiar to their respective States,
j The entire Course for those commencing the study of the Law is intended
to be completed in two years, divided into four terms, which correspond, with
those of the other departments of the University.
Every applicant for admission into this Department is expected to have
at least a complete English education. It is very desirable that he should
also have a Classical training before commencing the study of the Law; nev-
ertheless, those who may not possess this advantage will, without extra
charge, be offered ample facilities for acquiring a knowledge of the Classics
while pursuing their legal studies.
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time, bat
it is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves at the be-
ginning of a term.
The Students will be reejuired to pass through an examination at the close
of each term, and also to present an essay of not more than seven pages of
legal cap on some of the matters which they shall have seen. The notes of
these special examinations and essays, as well as those of the application and
general standing of the members in class throughout the Law Course,, will be
placed to their respective credits in the. result of the final examination for
the degree of LL.B.

i	*	j
>	Law Department.
•	Tv’e trust to see our Law Department better and better attended year after
।	year. We have every reason to be proud of the young men who each year
I have sought the classic retirement of Notre Dame to pursue their Law Stud-
: ies. We will endeavor to make their sojourn among us an agreeable one,
i and will give them all the advantages for study.
i
Civil Engineering.
This important Course is now thoroughly established, and will afford
our advanced students the „opportunity of fitting themselves for the practice
of the eminent profession whose name it bears.
Languages.
j It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame to pro-
f mote the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is so frequent and
necessary for business or scientific purposes. To facilitate this study, no
extra fee is exacted.
The German language, the classes of which are so numerously attended,
will be taught by three Professors during the next scholastic year. The
’ number of German students attending the University is becoming greater
every year. The French language, though more especially the language of
i the Collegiate Course, will be of great advantage to the Scientific students.
Other languages—such as Italian and Spanish—may be taught when required.
Phonography and Telegraptiy.
These two branches invite the special attention of the students of the
Commercial Course. The Telegraph Department is fully organized, and
placed under the management of a skilful electrician. Notre Dame is now
in direct communication with South Bend and the rest of the world by elec-
tric wires.
Anatomy and Materia Medica.
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find oppor-
tunities to do so at Notre Dame. Yet, owing to the want of a sufficient mu-
seum whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the
Course of Studies in this Department is limited, and embraces principally
Anatomy. The remainder of the Course is completed in some of our neigh-
boring Universities. As a Preparatory Course, that wThich is given here,
under Rev. L. Neyron, M. D., leaves nothing to be desired.
.	Painting and Drawing.
The Drawing Classes each year show a large increase over the preceding
SPECIALTIES.	S9
years. The University enjoys means adequate to all demands in this branch.
It possesses a large number of models in all sorts of drawings, a fine studio,
and vigilant and zealous teachers of the art.
Painting promises, likewise, to be one of the popular branches of Art
taught at Notre Dame. The famous painter Gregori, of Borne, has been en-
gaged to give instructions in oil painting. Gregori has no superior in Borne.
Music.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has five Profes-
sors, and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory system. An
Orchestra of fifteen pieces, with an excellent Quartette, and a Brass Band of
twenty-five instruments, are some of the leading features of the Musical De-
partment.
Vocal Music has received special attention during the past year. We
call the attention of our students and patrons to this favorite and useful
branch of music, which is now so deservedly popular. At present it may be
studied free of charge.
Astronomical Observatory.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which the
fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been placed. The
studies of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered practically interesting.
Libraries.
The College Library contains some twelve thousand volumes, very care-
fully arranged by the Librarian. Donations of books, especially to the Law
Library, will be thankfully received.
The Circulating Library was commenced three years ago with four hund-
red volumes. It now numbers over two thousand five hundred. All the Li-
braries which formerly belonged to the Literary and Beligious Societies have
been merged into it. Instead of the dozen or more book-cases which often
hid away instructive books, a beautiful collection of Literary and Beligious
works is now open to the students in an apartment fitted up as a Beading-
Boom.
Lecture Course.
There are a great many students -who, owing to different causes, progress
but slowly in the acquisition of knowledge in the class-room, who, in the lec-
ture hall, advance most rapidly; whilst all gain a more comprehensive and
practical perception of the various branches of Science when clearly and
concisely elucidated by the discourse of an expert. The importance of Lec-
tures has, therefore, never been overlooked at Notre Dame; but of late the
authorities of the University have been led to devote particular attention to
the organizing and developing of Lecture Courses on all the different import-
ant studies of the Institution. Henceforth, therefore, students may expect to
have every facility, without any interruption of classes, to assist at regular
Lectures on Philosophical, Historical, Literary and Scientific subjects. In
this respect, the success reached, this year, forms an epoch in our educational
training, and there is every reason for believing that the future will witness
still greater triumphs.

:	ful exercises of rowing, and also to contribute its share to the many pleasing
features of Commencement Day. It possesses two substantial boat-houses,
two four-oar barges, two six-oar barges, named the “ Hiawatha ” and “ Minne.
:	haha,” and one staff-boat—-the “Kina.” Two racestake place annually,—

The Notre Dame Scholastic
is the title of a neat 16-page paper published every week during term time at
the University. This journal not only opens a field for young aspirants to
literary fame who might otherwise, for want of a proper medium, allow their
talents in this line to remain inactive, but it also contains many articles of an
instructive and literary character from writers of mature and acknowledged
ability, thus rendering the Scholastic a valuable publication for all who
desire variety and instruction in their reading. During the past scholastic
year there have appeared in its pages nearly a hundred interesting biograph-
ical sketches of men of note in literature, science, painting, sculpture, etc.,
essays in prose and verse, and notes on art, music and literature, gleaned from
the best sources It will be the honest endeavor of the Editor, during the
coming year, to merit the encouragement given the paper during the past,
and the high encomiums bestowed upon it by first-class papers among the
weekly press.
In addition to its literary features, the Scholastic attaches to itself a
local importance to students, to their parents, and to all who have in former
years attended class at the University, by a weekly summary of events trans-
piring at Notre Dame, by personal notices of the old students, weekly Rolls
of Honor, Class Honors, and lists of excellence. Reports relative to the
arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic
students, etc., will also find a place in this paper, and keep parents and
friends accurately informed on all that concerns their children.

SAINT MARY’S ACADEMY.
(One Mile West of Notre Dame University.)
THIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are
taught here. Music, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Modern Lan-
guages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the religious instruction of Catholic pupils.
Pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of order, merely
required to attend the public religious exercises with the members of the
Institution.
The buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all modern improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths are
attached to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
Por further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are refer-
red to the Twenty-First Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy, for the
year 1875-6, or address,
ST. MARYS ACADEMY,
Notre Dame, Indiana.
N. B.—The friends of the Academy will be pleased to learn that there is
a regular omnibus line between South Bend, Notre Dame and St. Mary’s,
which connects regularly with all the trains arriving at South Bend.
