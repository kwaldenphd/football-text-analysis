HIS UNIVERSITY was founded in 1842, by the
Congregation of the Holy Cross, under the direction
of Very Rev. E. Sorin, and was chartered by the
Legislature of the State of Indiana in
o
to confer all the usual degrees.
with power
Pile Collcg'e building's arc on an eminence near two
small picturesque lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of
the fine and healthy farming region of the St. Joseph Valley.
The College can easily be reached from all parts of the United
States and Canada by means of three great trunk lines of railway
—the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, the Chicago and Lake
Huron, and the Great Western and Michigan Central; the first
two passing within a mile of the College grounds, and the last
connecting at Niles with the recently-built railway between that
city and South Bend, which runs within a half mile of the Col-
lege. At tire Michigan Southern railroad depot, South Bend,
omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained.
The Colleg-e grounds are extensive and well shaded, and contain
ball-alleys, gymnasiums, etc., with abundant room for all games
and athletic exercises. The buildings are new, having all been
erected since the destruction of the old College by fire in April,
1879, and arc well adapted for the purposes which they serve.
They are heated by steam, lighted by gas, supplied with hot and
cold water, and all the other modern improvements and conve-
niences. Particular attention has been given to the subjects of
ventilation and protection against fire, and in furnishing the various
rooms of the University every effort has been made to secure the
•Z
comfort and health of the inmates. The institution is capable of

giving accommodation to over five hundred resident students. It
is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot
naturally beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state onlv the advantages of
Health and Retirement
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution; a description of
all that pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limits of
these pages. We prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our
patrons, and to all who think of confiding their sons to our care, to
come and see, and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from the
Retired Rosition
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have
at heart the education of their children; and even the careless
student, when once interested in his studies, soon finds out the
benefits he can derive from an uninterrupted attention to class and
study. Though secluded in a great measure from the busy world
without, yet the number of students and the extensive College
grounds give him a world of his own, in which, what with Class,
Examination, Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations,
Baseball Clubs, Boat Clubs, Dramatic, Musical, Literary, Scien-
tific Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment and amusement, and
companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix his.mind on
his studies and establish him in habits of piety, application and
order, the influence of which will be felt during his entire life.
He breathes foi* a few short years the atmosphere of order, of
regularity in all that he does, of profound application to studies,
broken only by healthy and regular iecreation; and certainly in
our times, when serious and solid studies are becoming so rare—
when all kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time are
forced upon young students, when morals are so lightly watched
over—the advantage of the retired location of Notre Dame cannot

their testimony that the regular course of life, added to the salu- !
brious climate and the fresh country air, has done much to improve
the health of their children.	.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to j
preserve order and regularity. The morals and general deportment j
of the pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and I
personal habits receive the same attention as if they were in the ;
bosom of their own families.	!
t
The Education	।
given at Notre Dame is calculated to form both the heart and intel-
lect of the students. Every attention is given to their moral and
religious culture. Every day the students have an opportunity of
attending classes in which they may acquire a knowledge of Chris-
w	XX	.	.	.
tian doctrine. Twice a week, Lectures and instructions on religious
topics are delivered to all the students together. The religious ;
instruction is, of course, confined to Catholic students. The intel- ।
lectual training is carried on -with care and diligence bv the officers
and professors of the University. The best systems of teaching
are adopted, and the best authors for each branch selected; so that
no pains are spared to secure the objects which the University has
in view as an educational institution.
The Minim Department.
For the care and training of children under the age of thirteen,
there has been established a Department to which the most careful
attention has always been paid by the authorities of the University;
it is known as the Minim Department, and has ever been one of the
greatest objects of interest to the Faculty as well as to all persons
visiting Notre Dame. The pupils in this Department, unless for
their out-door sports, and in the refectory and dormitory, pass the
day entirely under the care of Sisters who take a tender and moth-
erly care of their young charges.
t4	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
All the elementary branches of an English education are here
taught, together with French and German. Also, for the Miniins.)
Music (fiano} is not an extra. In order to develop this Department !
and thereby extend the advantages it affords for the forming of the |
young heart, these concessions have lately been made in favor of I
the Minims.
Not the least considerable of the advantages enjoyed by the
pupils of the Minim Department is their complete separation from
the larger students. The discipline to which they are subject is
much milder than that of the students more advanced in age.
An elegant and commodious building, four stories in height,
ninety feet in length and forty-five feet wide, and affording every
accomodation for over one hundred Minims, is now in course of
erection, and will be completed for the opening of the classes in
September.

rious to religion or morals, their Professors, Prefects, or fellow- |

No one shall leave the University grounds without the permission
of the President or Vice-President, or the one delegated to represent
them.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the class-room,
or who have been guilty of misconduct, must perform such tasks
as shall be assigned them, and may be excluded from all college
exercises until these tasks be accomplished.
No book, periodical, or newspaper shall be introduced into the
College without having been previously examined and approved by
the Director of Studies. Objectionable books found in the posses-
sion of students will be withheld from them until their departure
from the University, or destroyed.
All letters sent or received by students may be opened by the
President or his representative.
General Information.
The academic year commences on the first Tuesdaj? of Septem-
ber, and closes during the last week of June, when the Annual
Commencement, the Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of
Premiums take place. It is divided into two Sessions. At the
termination of each Session a strict examination of all the different
classes is made in the presence of the Facuity. There is no vacation
at Etaster.
When a student presents himself for admission into the College,
he is examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class
for which his previous attainments may have qualified him. His
further promotion depends on his application and progress. Should
any student, during the year, be found capable of passing to a
higher class, he will be promoted, and such promotion is equivalent
to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of thca
students as shall have completed the Classical Course and passed
successfully an examination in all the branches of the course, before
the Faculty.
16	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
• The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on such of the
l	o
, graduates of the first degree as shall have devoted at least two
years to literary or scientific studies and shall have sustained satis-
; factorily an appropriate thesis. Students desiring to receive this
1	degree should make application in writing.
:	The Degree of LL. B., as also‘those of Bachelor of Science,
■	Master of Science, and Civil Engineer, will be conferred on similar j
j conditions.	j
j Diplomas will be given to the students who shall have completed
the Commercial course and passed a satisfactory examination before
the Board of Examiners. In all cases, students receiving diplomas ।
are supposed to be of good moral character.	,
2\To student 'whose deportment has been unsatisfactory, will re- i
ceive a Diploma or University Honor of any kind; nor will any |
degree be conferred until such time as all indebtedness to the In- }
stitution shall have been satisfactorily settled.	)
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the !
French and German languages. Not only are these languages ।
taught very carefully by persons of acknowledged competency, but
also there is every opportunity for conversation in these tongues.
All students applying for admission will be required to give
satisfactory evidence of their moral standing.
There arc in the Institution several Societies, whose constitutions
and by-laws have been approved by the Faculty; such as the Arch-
confraternity, Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, Holy Angels, Holy
Childhood, St. Aloysius Philodemic, Classical, Scientific, Thespian,
St. Cecilia, Columbian, St. Stanislaus Philopatrian, and Philhar-
monic Societies, Cornet Band, and Orchestra, with some of which
students are recommended to connect themselves.
'J^^In case of sickness the student does not remain in the College
rooms, but is immediately taken to the Infirmary, where he is
attended and nursed with devoted care, by experienced Sisters,
whose attention to the sick needs no recommendation.

DEPARTMENT
OF
Natural & Physical Science.
Students wishing to pursue a Scientific course will find every
facility for doing so at Notre Dame. Fully aware of the demands
of the age, the authorities have spared neither pains nor expense to
meet all the requirements of the student of the Physical and Nat-
ural Sciences.
The (Physical Cabinet
contains an extensive collection of apparatus of the latest style and
most improved construction. Several of them were on exposition
at the Centennial, and obtained for those who exhibited them the
highest awards given for physical instruments. Among these may
be mentioned Konig’s Apparatus for analyzing sound, electrical
and optical apparatus by Edgerton, instruments for projection, etc.
Besides the apparatus designed for subjective use and for experi-
mental purposes in the class-room, there is a large number of select
instruments for lecture purposes., especially for illustrating those
interesting branches of Physics, Acoustics, Optics, Magnetism, and
Electro-Magnetism, and Statical and Dynamical Electricity. In
Acoustics, the instruments for studying the origin and nature of
sound, the existence and interference of vibrations, together with
the beautiful apparatus designed by Lissajous, Konig and others
for the observation of sonorous vibrations by the optical and stro-
boscopic method, and by means of manometric flames, are of the
most improved character. The instruments for illustrating Optics
are also most select and complete. Besides the stereopticons,
vertical lanterns, microscopes, spectroscopes, etc., for projection,
there is a large number of slides, transparencies, and preparations
for illustrating the various branches of Physical and Natural Science,
Astronomy, Architecture, Art, etc. The apparatus for the study
of spectrum analysis—including a fine Heidelberg spectroscope, a
f	"■	-
j 36	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
t______________ ________________________________________________
collection of Plucker tubes for obtaining the spectra of gases and
vapors—prisms, lenses, and other apparatus for projecting spectra
j on the screen, as well as those used in studying the phenomena
of the double refraction and polarization of light, should also be
! mentioned. For studying statical and dynamical electricity, mag-
i netism, and electro-magnetism, there is a large number of electrical
! machines, and batteries of different kinds, coils, helices, magnets,
electro-magnets, galvanometers, thermo-electric multipliers, Geisler
tubes, rotators, magno-electric and electro-magnetic machines, tel-
egraph apparatus, telephones, etc.
The Chemical Laboratory
is fitted up with all the appliances necessary for the successful study
| of General Chemistry and Chemical Analysis. As in the Physical
i Cabinet, additions are constantly being made to the Laboratory, and
it will be the object of the authorities to make it in all its details as
complete and perfect as possible.
The Museum of Natural History,
embracing large and rare geological, mineralogical, zoological and
botanical collections, is as complete in all its arrangements as the
student could desire.
The Mineralogical Cabinet
contains a large collection of minerals from all parts of the world.
It is especially rich in specimens illustrating the crystalline structure,
modes of occurence, etc., of the various ores and minerals, and em-
braces a large number of magnificent specimens of pellucid quartz
crystals, cairngorm stone, amethyst, agate, jasper, sardonyx, chal-
cedony, geodes of various kinds, calcite of all the principal crystal-
line forms, amazon stone, fluorspar, mica, tourmaline, beryl, den-
drite, selenite, garnet, the various ores of gold, silver, iron, copper,
lead, zinc, as well as of the other metals of rarer occurrence. For
the practical study of the physical properties of minerals, the
student of mineralogy will find in this collection- all he could wish
for. Besides this, there is also a rich store of specimens for blow-
pipe analysis.
PHYSICAL AND NATURAL SCIENCES.
The Geological Cabinet
is very complete, both in the number and character of the specimens ,
it contains. It embraces fossils of all the geological formations, ;
both of this country and Europe. Among them are many unusu- *
ally well preserved, and of more than ordinary size. In a word, it is ,
furnished with all the specimens that the student needs to make t
the study of Geology easy and interesting.
Tofular Lectures on the (Physical and Natural Sciences I
form one of the most interesting features in connection with the ।
Scientific Department. These are intended mainly for those stu- 1
dents who cannot or do not wish to take up the Scientific Course,
but who nevertheless desire to have a general knowledge of the
leading facts and principles of the Physical and Natural Sciences.
All these lectures, especially those on Physics and Chemistry, are '
illustrated experimentally; and, to attain most effectually the object !
in view, the best of apparatus and specimens, especially those i
designed for projection, have been secured.	!
Donations to the Museum.
A CARD OF THANKS.
The Curator of the Museum most gratefully acknowledges
donations during the past year, of valuable specimens of Natural
History from the following persons:
Mr. James C. Fenlon, Leavenworth, Kansas, a very complete
and valuable collection of gold and silver ores from the mines of !
Colorado, Old and New Mexico, Nevada, and California.	1
Mr. Aug. Pein, Galena, Ill., a fine collection of ores of lead, zinc, (
and iron.	‘
Messrs. J. and W. J. Coleman, Washington, D. C., a collection
of ores and minerals from various mines in Colorado.
Master Louis Florman, Rapid City, Dakota, a number of valu-
able specimens of gold ore from the Black Hills.
Mr. John C. Larkin, Pottsville, Pa., a collection of specimens
from the Pennsylvania Coal Measures.
Mr. Raphael Becerra, Vera Cruz, Mexico, a number of fine
specimens of calcite from Mexico.
38	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Messrs. T. J. Ortchard, J. A. Burrichter, M. Dingel, A. Kirch-
baum, and T. B. Hughlett, Galena, Ill., for rare and valuable
crystallized specimens of galena, calcite, zinc, blende, and iron
pyrites.
To other kind friends, also, who have in various ways rendered
him material aid in increasing his collections, the Curator returns
his most sincere thanks.
An Appeal.
One of the greatest losses occasioned by the disastrous fire that
laid the Colleo-e buildings in ashes was the almost total destruction
o	o
of the
&
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.
All the valuable collections of years were consumed,—only a
small collection of specimens that happened to he in an out-building
being spared. In order to repair this loss as far and as speedily as
possible, the Curator of the Museum respectfully solicits the aid and
co-operation of the friends and old students of Notre Dame,—of
those especially who live in mining districts, or where specimens of
Natural History can be readily obtained. He would be particularly
obliged for specimens of
Minerals,	Fossils,
Shells,	Corals,
Alchotiolic Preparations,
Indian Relics, Etc., Etc.
All collections, however small, will be thankfully received and
duly acknowledged in the columns of the Scholastic. All contri-
butions should be sent to
Rev. J. A. ZAHM, C. S. C., (Aerator oj~ Afteseecm^
Notre Dame, Indiana.
Law Department.
All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included
in the Course. The Common Law System of Pleading and practice
is taught. The course of studies in this Department embraces,
chiefly, Constitutional and International Law, Municipal Law, Law
of Contracts, Equity Jurisprudence, Criminal Law, Evidence,
Pleading, and Practice.
For the purpose of acquiring a practical as well as a theoretical
knowledge of the legal profession, the students shall, during the
Course, be required to argue cases, draw up pleadings, and conduct
Law and Chancery suits according to the rules and formalities of
regular courts of justice.
As it is a matter of the highest importance to a young lawyer
that on being admitted to the practice of his profession he should
be able to express himself clearly and fluently, full opportunity will
be offered for cultivating the art of public speaking. As one means
of attaining this end, and for the purpose of familiarizing the stu
dent with the practical workings of his future profession, Moot
Courts, under the direction of a Professor, will be frequently held
during the Course. For the cultivation of other kinds of eloquence,
still further facilities are afforded in the various Literary and Debat-
ing Societies of the University.
The entire Course for those commencing the study of the Law
is intended to be completed in two years, divided into four terms,
which correspond with those of the other departments of the
University.
Every applicant for admission into this Department is expected
to have, at least, a complete English education. It is very desirable
that he should also have a Classical training before commencing the
study of the Law; nevertheless, those who may not possess this
advantage will, without extra charge, be offered ample opportunities
for acquiring a knowledge of the Classics while pursuing their legal
studies.
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any

■ time, but it is more advisable and profitable for them to present
I themselves at the beginning of a term.
i The students will be required to pass an examination at the close
, of each term, and to present an essay of not more than seven pages
i of legal cap, on some of the matters which they shall have seen,
! and furthermore to give proof of proficiency in Rhetoric, English
! Literature, and Logic, before being allowed to graduate. The
notes of the special examinations and essays, as well as those of the
application and general standing of the members in class’throughout
the Law Course, will be placed to their respective credits in the !
result of the final examination for the degree of LL. B. The fol-
' lowing comprises a list of the authors generally read during the
: course: Walker’s American Law; Blackstone’s Commentaries;
; Parsons’ Contracts; Greenleaf’s Evidence; Washburn on Real
: Propertv; Stephen on Pleading; Equitv Jurisprudence—Story/
> Constitutional Law; Criminal Law—Bishop.
Commercial Department.
It will be seen that the course requires two years’ study for
graduation; it includes arithmetic, grammar and letter-writing,
geography, United States history, reading, spelling, penmanship,
book-keeping, and Commercial Law,—that is, a complete business
education.
Considering the character and needs of the country, especially
the great West in which we live, this Course is the most practical,
and one of the most important that an educational institution can
i afford.
| Those, therefore, who have not the time or the means to take a
j complete college course, in the Classics and Sciences, would do
• well to enroll themselves in the Commercial Course. No plan of
; study is more injudicious than a hap-hazard selection of such studies
COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT.	41
as an inexperienced student may fancy. The consistent training
resulting from a fixed course of studies is of the utmost benefit to
the student.
The Commercial Course at Notre Dame has always received
the most careful attention on the part of the officers and Commer-
cial Faculty of the University. Notre Dame claims to give the
graduates of this Course a more complete business training than
can be obtained in any commercial college. Believing that a bus-
iness education includes something more than a mere knowledge of
Book-keeping, and that a good education cannot be had in a few
weeks, this course has been extended over two years, the shortest
time in which the studies necessarily used in business life can be
mastered. Should a student desire during this period to take up
any other studies in which he may be interested, and for which he
has time, he will have liberty to do so. General History and linear
drawing are especially recommended to the students of this course.
Many commercial students find it also to their advantage to take
up the study of German or French, for which there arc the am-
plest facilities. A talented and studious young man may thus in
the course of two years find himself in possession of a most valuable
practical education, which will fit him to take his place in the front
rank of educated business men.

Specialties.
Tost=Graduate Course.
The Students in this Course occupy themselves with Philosophy,
History, and the Natural and Physical Sciences. Law, Medicine
and Civil Engineering are optional studies of the Course.
Lazo (Department.
We trust to see our Law Department better and better attended
year after year. We have every reason to be proud of the young-
men who each year have sought the classic retirement of Notre
Dame to pursue their Law Studies. We shall endeavor to make
their sojourn among- us an agreeable one, and g-ive them every
facility for study.
Civil Engineering.
This important Course has long been thoroughly established,
and affords advanced students the opportunity of fitting themselves
for the practice of this eminent profession.
Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame
to promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is
so frequent and necessary for business or scientific purposes.
The German Lanp-uap'e—the classes of which are so numerouslv
o o
attended—has been taught by five Professors during the past
scholastic year. The number of German students attending the
University is becoming greater every year. The French Language
—though more especially the language of the Collegiate Course—
will be of ©Teat advantage to the Scientific student. Other lan-
guages—such as Italian and Spanish—may be taught when required.
Telegraphy.
This branch invites the special attention of the students of the
Commercial Course. The Telegraph Department is fully organ-
ized, and is placed under the management of a skilful electrician.
!	46	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Notre Dame is now in direct communication with South Bend
and the rest of the world by electric wires.
(Phonography, or Short=Hand,
of which Dr. Johnson said “its usefulness is not confined to any
particular science or profession,” and which, with a good education,
is a profession in itself, has been taught for many years at Notre
Dame. A knowledge of this useful art, besides being of incalcula-
ble benefit in the higher branches of education, will also be found
useful in professional life. By its aid, notes of readings and lectures
can be taken with almost the rapidity of thought and vocal utter-
ance. Phonography has of late come into almost general use in
the mercantile community, to expedite correspondence, etc.; a
knowledge of the art will therefore be a recommendation to its
possessor for positions of confidence and trust, and thus perhaps
become a stepping-stone to fortune.
Anatomy and (Materia (Medica.
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will
find opportunities to do so at Notre Dame. The Course of Studies
in this Department embraces Materia Medica, Anatomy, and Sur»
gery. As a Preparatory Course, that which is given here, under
L. Neyron, M. D., a graduate of the Ecole do Medicine, Lyons,
leaves nothing’ to be desired.
(Drawing and (Painting.
The University enjoys means adecpiate to all demands in this
branch. It possesses a large number of models in all sorts of draw-
ing, a fine Studio, and qualified and zealous teachers of the art. The
services of the eminent artist Signor Luigi Gregori have been
secured for the coming year.
(Music.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has able
Professors, and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory
system. An Orchestra of fifteen pieces, with an excellent Quartette,
and a Brass Band of twenty-five instruments, are some of the lead-
ing features of the Musical Department.

Vocal Music, to which special attention has been paid during the
past year, will receive even more careful attention in future, and it
is hoped that this branch will become every year more popular
among the students.

A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in
which the fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has
been placed. The studies of the class of Astronomy are now ren-
dered practically interesting;
(R eading^Tooms.
Before the reopening of the classes in September two reading-
rooms will have been fitted up on the lower floor of the new Music
Hall for the benefit of the Senior and Junior Departments. They
will be supplied with books from the Library, and with such peri-
odicals as the Faculty may deem advisable to permit, and students
will have access to them during their hours of recreation.
The Lemonnier Library
continues to receive contributions from liberal friends, and now
‘ numbers nearly 16,000 volumes. A Reading-room has been opened
in connection with the Library, in which the following periodicals
are to be found on file, viz.: Atlantic Monthly, Lippincott’s
Magazine, Harper’s Magazine, Scribner’s Magazine, Cornhill
Magazine, Macmillan’s Magazine, Geological Magazine, Black-
wood’s Magazine, International Review, North-American Review,
British Review, Edinburgh Review, London Review, Westminster
Review, Contemporary Review, Fortnightly Review, The Nine-
teenth Century, Le Correspondant, Le Contemporain, Revue Cath-
olique, Athemeum, Academy, Scientific American, Science Review,
Dublin Review, Lamp, Catholic Quarterly, Catholic World, Lon-
don Month, Alt und Neue Welt, Der Hausschatz, besides a large
number of dailies and weeklies. The members of the Library As-
sociation desire to give their Alma Mater a collection of books which
can stand comparison with those possessed by the other educational
establishments of the United States, therefore they call on the
friends of the University to assist them, by donations of books,
pamphlets, periodicals and manuscripts. All contributions should
be addressed to the Librarian of the Lemonnier Library, Notre
Dame University, Notre Dame, Indiana.

Society of the Holy Childhood.
The primary object of the Society of the Holy Childhood, of
which this Society forms a part, is to offer an opportunity to
children throughout the Christian world to contribute their share
towards the redemption of pagan children from the darkness of
heathenism. The monthly contributions are small, but the aggre-
gate is considerable—while thousands of children are by this
means trained up to habits of charity.

[From the “ tVotre Dame Scholastic
Commencement Week.
The exercises of Commencement week at Notre Dame were
exceptionally pleasant and interesting—a fitting conclusion to a year
profitably spent by the great majority of the students, and to the
graduates a happy termination of their college career.
The weather was auspicious. Although Vennor and the Scho-
lastic astrologer have been doing their best for some time to flood
the West, to make the summer disagreeably cold and wet, the stu-
dents and concourse of visitors at the Notre Dame Commencement
seem to have been befriended—to have had things just as they
wished,—and, of course, they enjoyed themselves accordingly.
Perhaps the Scholastic astrologer had something to do with this;
if so, we arc all under deep obligations to him, and hope he will
always act with the same consideration for the comfort and hap-
piness of others.
The examination of classes in the various departments—Classical,
Scientific, Commercial, Fine Arts, and Special Branches—were not
concluded till late on Tuesday; but the ever-active St. Cecilia Phi-
lomathean Association, which this year is unusually strong in num-
bers and talent, made an agreeable diversion by their Entertain-
ment—being the twenty-fourth of their annual summer exercises—
in the new Exhibition Hall on Saturday evening. The programme
has already appeared in the Scholastic.
Even on Saturday many visitors had arrived for the Commence-
ment Exercises, and, with those from the neighborhood, the hall
was nearly filled. The music by the University Cornet Band,
song and chorus by F. Kuhn, G. Tracy, L. Florman, C. Echlin,
and others, and a choice selection from “The Bohemian Girl” by
the University Orchestra, were excellently rendered. Geo. J.
Rhodius apostrophized Old Washington Hall, now among the
things that were, and called attention to its more magnificent suc-
cessor, in metrical numbers. Next followed an address in French
by J. V. O’Donnell. The St. Cecilians then presented their new
drama, “ The Outcast,” translated and arranged from the French
by President Walsh. The Cecilians of ’82 have developed no
little elocutionary and histrionic talent under the careful tuition of
Prof. Lyons, and their programme was very creditably carried out.
The following* paragraph is clipped from an editorial in the
Aozdh-Bend Trib line:
“The crowds of visitors at Notre Dame this year exceeds those of any
previous year. The new University building is so much larger than the old,
COMMENCEMENT WEEK.	89
and its corridors and Rotunda so spacious, that a brigade could encamp in
them without being crowded. Besides this there are the new Music Hall
and a half dozen other magnificent buildings, so, all in all, there is no lack
of accommodations, no odds how large the influx of visitors may be. Every
modern improvement to be had is to be found at Notre Dame. Visitors find
so many changes and improvements about the place that they are lost in
wonder and admiration at what can be done in one short year. Gregori, the
great Roman artist, is making Notre Dame famous as a centre of art. His
own work not only wins the most enthusiastic encomiums from those who
see it, but he has found there, and restored for public inspection, one of the
most valuable paintings in America, a Van Dyke. Under President Walsh,
the University has been most successful. The attendance was larger this
college yeai' than any preceding one, and the students speak in the highest
terms of the President and Faculty, and the great advantages at the University
for prosecuting studies.”
On Monday the examinations went on all day; but in the even-
ing the Rotunda was brilliantly illuminated and handsomely deco-
rated in preparation for the Oratorical contest, or closing exercises
of the Graduates and Euglossians. We regret that space prevents
a lengthened notice of the essays, all of which were as good as
could be expected. It is just to say that the Euglossians never
acquitted themselves more creditably than on this occasion. Rev.
President Walsh made the closing remarks, and expressed himself
greatly pleased with the different performances. In lieu of any-
thing of our own, we give a special telegram to the Chicago
Daily Times.
“ South Bend, Ind., June 20.—The closing exercises of the Graduates and
Euglossians, introductory to the thirty-eighth annual commencement of
Notre Dame University, took place last evening in the Rotunda in the pres-
ence, perhaps, of the largest concourse of visitors ever gathered there. The
Rotunda and halls were brilliant with electric lights. The exercises opened
with a comic chorus, and then followed the speeches of the contestants for
the oratorical prize. The first was a Scientific address, by E. C. Orrick; M.
Healy followed with an address on Law. J. Solon declaimed N. P. Willis’s
‘ Absalom,’ and George Clarke spoke on ‘ Our Duties.’ Each of the four
contestants acquitted himself so creditably that it will be difficult for the
judges to decide who was best.”
Examination continued 011 Tuesday up to 3.30 o’clock At 5
the notes and averages were read, taking up the time till supper.
In the evening, Sophocles’ “ GEdipus Tyrannus,” which had been
in preparation for some weeks, was brought out in the Academy
of Music with a degree of success quite unexpected even by the most
sanguine. To avoid what might be considered egotism on our
part, we will let the daily papers criticise the performance and ad-
juncts. We are obliged, however, to abbreviate this and the other
excerpts. The special correspondent deputed by the Chicago daily
Times, writes:
“ Notre Dame, Ind., June 21.—The commencement exercises at the insti-
tution of Notre Dame have drawn, as usual, a large number of visitors from
90
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
all parts of the Union. They have received the genial welcome of the Presi-
dent, Rev. Thos. E. Walsh, taken part in exercises of unusual interest and are
the recipients of a graceful and cordial hospitality for which the University is
noted. The local Hellenists have had the courage to present ‘The CEdipus
Tyrannus,’judiciously framed, it is true, so as to hide its horrible story. With
this they opened the hall on Tuesday.
SOPHOCLES BY THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
seems an anachronism, but the costumes had historic verity. The choruses
were given with surprisingly good effect, many of the voices having large
compass and great sweetness, and the shortened dialogue, it is said, was spoken
with good accent, as certainly it was rendered with force and spirit. What
might easily have proven a ludicrous failure, was presented with good histri-
onic effect. Difficult and ambitious as was the undertaking, it carried the in-
terest of the auditors to the closing chorus, and Avon from Bishop Dwenger,
of Fort Wayne, some cordial words of commendation, though the portly
dignitarv has the appearance of a man who could never do aught than speak
kindly?’
From an editorial in the South Bend daily Times we take the fol-
lowhw extract:
o
“ The new college hall at Notre Dame was opened by the production of ‘ CEdi-
pus Tyrannus ’ by the Hellenists of Notre Dame, complimentary to Right
Rev. Joseph Dwenger, Bishop of Fort Wayne; Right Rev. Francis S. Chatard,
Bishop of Vincennes; and Right Rev. John Watterson, Bishop of Colum-
bus, Ohio. A large and intellectual audience was present. Distinguished
people from all sections of the country, both clergy and laity, greeted the Hel-
lenists, and the applause that was given testified the appreciation of the audi-
ence. This is the first time that a Greek play was ever produced west of the
Alleghanies. The costumes were designed by Signor Gregori, the renowned
artist. The music was composed expressly for the occasion by Mr. Nobles, one
of the Professors of Music at Notre Dame. The professors were ably sec-
onded by the Hellenists in their efforts to make the drama a success.”
As the tale of CEdipus has already been told in the Scholastic^
we need not allude to the plot of the play, which had been carefully
adapted for the occasion. The Times continues:
“ The entertainment commenced at eight o’clock, and occupied an hour and a
half in its presentation. During this time, not one word of English was
spoken (the play being in Greek), but the audience was so interested that not
the least impatience or fatigue was shown.
The singing was the finest ever heard at Notre Dame—especially the duets
by Masters Florman and Schaefer. The play was a success in every particular,
owing to the indefatigable efforts of the Rev. Fathei' Stoffel, well known in
the West as a Greek scholar of the first order. He will ever be remembered by
the students and friends of Notre Dame as a scholar, a gentleman, a good
priest and time friend.”
The following excerpt is from an editorial in the South-Bend
Daily Tribune of the 21st:
“ The new Music Hall at Notre Dame was formally dedicated last night with
one of the most novel and interesting- entertainments ever witnessed in the
West—a Greek play, ‘ CEdipus Tyrannus? The hall was brilliantly illuminated
with electric lights and filled with a large and cultured audience. The Hall,
COMMENCEMENT WEEK.	91
though not yet completed, presented a fine appearance. It contains the very
best of acoustic proportions, the faintest speech on the stage being distinctly
audible in the remotest part of the auditorium. The original play being too
long, Father Stoffel re-wrote it entire for the occasion, by no means a small
task. The music with which the play abounds was adapted to the words by
Mr. Nobles, a talented Professor at the University. This was the most inter-
esting part of the performance to a native-born Yankee, whose early Greek
education had been neglected. The costumes were very fine, being faithful
imitations of the Grecian attire of the ancient period represented in the play.
The parts were well committed, and there was no perceptible hitch in the
performance. All of the characters did admirably, and the music, both solo
and chorus, was finely rendered. This was frequently applauded. The enter-
tainment may be considered a grand success, when taken into consideration
that no other college in the country except classic old Harvard has attempted
CEdi-pusy	‘
Of the Hall in which the play was given, the South-Bend
Evening Register says further:
“ Our readers must take an early opportunity to see the Music Hall at Notre
Dame. It is certainly one of the most attractive rooms in which to give public
entertainments to be seen anywhere. It is octagonal in form, and the acoustic
properties are unusually good. Large, tastefully-designed windows on the
east and west afford ample light for day performances, and at night three
electric lamps make a noonday radiance in every part of the auditorium, stage
and gallery. The gallery, which is reserved for students of the University,
has a seating capacity of 500, and the body of the hall, the tiers of seats in
which are arranged in horse-shoe shape, and slope down from the rear to the
stage, will accommodate about seven hundred people. The stage is well pro-
vided with scenery, and altogether Notre Dame has a public hall of which it
may well feel proud. The interior is still to be frescoed, and further painting
is to be done, but sufficient progress has been made to admit of the use of
the hall, and to afford an intelligent idea of what it will be when fully clothed
with its further adornments.”
Wednesday’s Exercises opened with a solemn High Mass for
the Associated Alumni, which was celebrated at 8 o’clock, by Rev.
President Walsh, assisted by Rev. D. A. Clarke as deacon, and Rev.
D. Tighe as subdeacon. A large number of the Rev. clergy were
present in the sanctuary. The usual sermon was preached by the
Right Rev. Bishop Watterson, of Columbus, who is a cousin of ’
the well-known journalist, Henry Watterson. It was an excellent
discourse, admirably suited to the audience and the occasion. At
the conclusion of High Mass, the Te Deum was sung, and never,
we believe, with more grateful hearts. Formerly the Alumni Mass
used to be celebrated at an earlier hour, before breakfast, but the
change this year was found to be a great convenience. The at-
tendance, too, was larger than on former occasions. The boat-race
came off at 10 o’clock, after which there was a meeting of the
Alumni.
Of the boat race the Chicago Times says:
“ The beautiful lake, embowered almost in the forest primeval, consisting
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
here of a stately growth of hickory, oak, ash, and linden, was the scene of this
trial of strength. The contestants rowing oared boats were to make the length
of the lake thrice. The whites, with R. Anderson for coxswain, and the bines,
coached by J. McIntyre, bent lustily to their work, but as they neared the
shore for the first turn, the whites broke an oar-lock, disabling them, and
victory crowned the blues. They were evenly matched, and the whites were
the favorites, as they won last year.”
The Alumni Association had a large and interesting, meeting as
usual, and elected as officers for the following year: President,
Rev. T. E. Walsh; Vice-Presidents, Rev. D. A. Clarke, of Colum-
bus, and Dennis A. Plogan, of Chicago; Secretary, Rev. N. Stoffel;
Treasurer, J. A. Lyons; Orator, W. J. Clarke, of Columbus; Al-
ternate, John G. Ewing, of Lancaster, Ohio; Poet, Rev. M. B.
Brown, of Wellsville, Ohio; Alternate, Arthur J. Stace, of South
Bend, who was also chosen Historian.
The Alumni dinner came off at 1.30 o’clock, in the Junior dining-
hall, and .was numerously attended, of course. After the inner
man had been refreshed, speeches grave and gay were made, in re-
sponse to appropriate toasts, by Rt. Rev. Bishop Dwenger, Donn
Piatt, Rev. Fathei Stoffel, Mr. W. J. Hoynes of the Chicago Bar,
Prof. Devoto, and Prof. Stace, who also acted as toast-master.
In the afternoon there was a baseball match on the Seniors’ Cam-
pus between two nines composed chiefly of those who had rowed
in the boat-race, and the result will show how closely they are
matched in athleticsports. We give the South Bend Times's ac-
count of the game:
“ At the time foi' the game to commence, the respective nines appeared
on the field, ready for the fray. The Notre Dame Unions wore uniforms of gray,
with caps of the same color, and blue stockings. The Star of the West wore
white uniforms and caps, with red stockings. The Stars won the toss and
sent their opponents to the bat. The first five innings were marked on both
sides by heavy batting and loose fielding, most of the runs of the game
being made before the sixth inning. During the last four innings both nines
got down to work in earnest, and at the end of the seventh the score stood 15
to 14 in favor of the Unions. In the eighth the Unions were presented with
a goose-egg, and the Stars scored one run, making the score a tie. In the
ninth, each nine gave the other a blank, and a tenth inning was necessary to
decide the game. The Unions went to the bat and were re-tied in one, two,
three order. The Stars succeeded in getting a man to third base and one at
second, after one man was out, when, by a splendid double play, the side was
put out, leaving the game still a tie. It being late, it was decided to postpone
the playing off of the tie, and the players left the field. Mr. John Lambin, a
former student of the college, acted as umpire, giving excellent satisfaction.\
At 6.30 o’clock, on the evening of Wednesday, a large and dis-
tinguished audience was gathered in the new Hall to witness the
exercises of the Thespian Society, and listen to a speech by Col.
Piatt. After some excellent music by the Band and Orchestra, and
a chorus by the Choral Union, President Walsh, in a few graceful
words, introduced the orator. Mr. Piatt’s discourse, it hardly need

be remarked, was a characteristic one, and was particularly pleasing,
it is said, to the lady portion of the audience. Next followed
Pizarro, a drama in five acts, which the members of the Thespian
Society rendered so well as to sustain the high reputation for
histrionic talent which the organization has always enjoyed. The
closing remarks were made by the Rt. Rev. Bishop of Fort
Wayne, in his usual felicitous manner.
Thursday morning the sun rose clear and bright, giving promise
of a beautiful day. At an early hour everyone was moving, and
here and there and everywhere, groups of vivacious friends were
gathered together engaged in pleasant converse. Shortly after break-
fast the mammoth bell announced the closing exercises of Com-
mencement. All having repaired to the Hall, the Band played a
stirring march, after which W. B. McGorrisk delivered the
customary valedictory, which was heartily applauded, as it deserved
to be. We have yet to read a more appropriate valedictory. It
was graceful, without being too flowery, and feeling, without be-
ing too pathetic; full, and yet not diffuse. The Oration of the day,
by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Chatard, Bishop of Vincennes, was an able and
scholarly discourse and was listened to with close attention. Later
on, it will be republished in a more permanent form. As soon as
the oration was concluded, came the distribution of premiums,
awarding of honors and diplomas, conferring of degrees, etc. It
was a rather long ceremony, and we are of opinion that many will
be glad to hear that President Walsh intends to curtail it next year
by shortening the exercises of the previous day, and having the
distribution of premiums in the Minim department and in the
Preparatory and Commercial courses at some other time.
When the last diploma had been borne away by the smiling re-
cipient, Right Rev. Bishop Dwenger made a short address to the
assembly, in which he took occasion to congratulate the students on
their peaceful triumphs, remarking that he considered the Com-
mencement of ’82 by far the most successful ever held at Notre
Dame. When the Bishop had ceased speaking, the Band struck
up the tender strains of “ Home, Sweet Home.”
The list of Degrees, Honors, Premiums, etc., being published else-
where in the Scholastic, our task as chronicler of the Commence-
ment Exercises of ’82 is done. We cannot lay aside our pencil,
however, without expressing regret at our inability for wTant of
space to report the evening entertainments at greater length—at
not having been able to bestow a more generous meed of praise on
all who merited it, and to make particular mention of all who dis-
tinguished themselves. Of course, everyone is ready to admit that
the Greek play was the feature, and we have allotted space to it
accordingly.
I.
UZhe Notre Dame Scholastic
is the title of a neat 16-page paper devoted to the interests of the
students, which is published at the University every week, during
term time. This journal opens a field for young writers, who
might otherwise, for want of a proper medium, allow their talents
to remain inactive.
The Scholastic contains articles of an instructive and literary
character, interesting Biographical Sketches of men of note in
Literature, Science, Painting, Sculpture, etc., Essays, Poetry,
Notes on Art, Music, Science and Literature, Notices of new
publications, etc., etc.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic has a
local importance for students, their parents, and all who have
attended class at the University in times past, on account of the
weekly summary of events transpiring at Notre Dame, personal
notices of former students, weekly Rolls of Honor, Class Honors,
lists of excellence, etc., which appear in its columns every week.
Reports relative to the arrangement of classes, the promotion
of the more talented and energetic students, etc., also find a
place in this paper, and keep parents and others informed on
all that concerns their children and friends.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors, during the coming year,
to merit the encouragement given the paper in the past, and the
encomiums bestowed upon it by the press in general.
