When the Congregation of Holy Cross planted its standard in the St.
Joseph Valley in 1842, the time of Very Rev. E. Sorin’s arrival, the prospects
of success were but moderate; but the founder of the College, poor in purse,
yet rich in zeal and energy, strong in his confidence in God and in his devotion
to the Queen of heaven, the help of Christians, to whom he dedicated the great
enterprise he was then beginning, has seen the College gradually expand to its
present growth, and gain the confidence of all who have patronized it.
Tiro University of Notre Dame
has attained its present honorable position among the educational institutions
of the United States by the steady and persevering efforts of its founder and all
connected with it to realize the object for which it was established: to give an
. opportunity to the youth of America of obtaining a thorough education,—men-
tal, moral, and physical.
The experience of a quarter of a century has shown that the system
adopted and gradually developed by the increasing importance of the College
is a good and efficient one. By strictly adhering to it the College has sprung
up vigorously, with no mushroom growth that gives no promise of strength
and long life, but like the sturdy oak that each year adds steadily but surely to
its strength. And though the “improvements”—a word so familiar to all the
friends of Notre Dame-—that have been made in the grounds and buildings are i
more apparent to the casual visitor, yet to those intimately acquainted with the !
Institution it is evident that the same energy and reliance in God, that have i
replaced the old log house on the lakeside—the only house on the premises .
when Very Rev. E. Sorin arrived—by the buildings that are now seen, have .
been busy in	increasing and	perfecting the means	of	rendering the	youth	of	>
Notre Dame	thorough students while in the Institution,	and	good	citizens	!
in the various walks of life.	•
Tire Cliarter	J
i of the Institution, granted by the Legislature of Indiana, in 1844, under the ■
j name of “University of Notre Dame,” empowers it to confer degrees in all the ’
learned professions.	'	*
The University is ‘conducted by the Fathers of the Congregation of Holy 1
Cross; a number of highly competent Lay Professors assist in the various <
branches of studies; other teachers and the prefects of discipline are taken from '
among the Brothers of Holy Cross, who are, like the Father's, devoted by their
sacred calling to the education of youth.	'

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
the most perfect order and regularity. The morals and the general deportment
of the pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal hab-
its receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own families.
Tlxe X-o cation

of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the Students.
It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot naturally beau-
tiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
Healili and Retirement,
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution;—a description of all that
pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limits of these pages. We
prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons, and to all who think of con-
fiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from the
s Retired Position
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart the
education of their children; and even the careless student when once interested
in his studies soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an uninterrupted at-
tention to class and study. Though secluded in a great measure from the busy
world without, yet the number of Students and the extensive College grounds
give him a world of bis own, in which, what with Class, Examination, Notes,
Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Base-ball Clubs, Dramatic and Mu-
sical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment and amusement, and companions,
ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix his mind on his studies and establish
him in habits of piety, application and order,—the influence of which will be felt
his entire life. He breathes for a few short years the atmosphere of order, reg-
ularity in all that he does; of profound application to studies, broken only by
healthy and regular recreation, and certainly, in our times, when serious and
solid studies are becoming so rare, when all kinds of inducements to waste and
fritter away time are forced upon young Students, when morals are so lightly
watched over, the advantage of the retired locality of Notice Dame cannot be
too highly spoken of.
Health.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health, and those
who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony that the regular
course of life, added to the salubrious climate, the fresh country air, has done
much to improve the health of their children. In case-of sickness, the student
does not remain in the College rooms, but is immediately taken to the apart-
ments of the Infirmary, where he is attended and nursed with devoted care by
experienced Sisters, whose care for the sick needs no commendation here to be
duly appreciated.

1	from all parts of the United States by means of either of two great trunk lines	,
i of Railroad,—the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana, and the Michigan

- passes the College twice a day. In South Bend there are several hotels.	p

■ is a structure one hundred and sixty feet long, eighty-five feet deep and six sto-
! ries high, surmounted by a well-proportioned dome, on the summit of which
j stands a statue of the Blessed Virgin—a beautiful work of art. The exterior
i of the building, especially when viewed from the wide avenue that stretches a
mile in front of the College, makes a favorable impression upon all beholders;
' and the interior, admirably arranged and divided up into Study Halls, Recitation
Rooms, etc., for the accommodation and comfort of the Students who live—not
i merely study and recite—in it, completes the good opinion already formed by a
view of the exterior.
The Eastern Wing, eighty-five feet long, forty-five feet wide and six sto-
ries high, contains the Dining-Room, Study-Hall, and Sleeping Apartments of
the Senior Students.
The Western Wing, of the same dimensions as the Eastern, contains the
same apartments for the Junior Students.
In the Central Building are the Wash Rooms for Juniors and Seniors;
Parlors; private rooms for Professors, and Class Rooms; the Museum Library,
and College Chapel.
•	Tire Music Hall
stands to the east, a building one hundred feet long and forty-five feet wide and
two stories high. It is divided off into Music Rooms, each containing a piano,
and other instruments of music. Great attention has already been given to Vo-
’ cal and Instrumental Music. The confined success this year of the Choir, the ,
* Philharmonic Society, the Band and Orchestra, under the direction of their re-
spective Professors, is the best proof that great attention has been paid to this
' department during the past ten months.
; On the ground floor of this building is the
Juniors’ Recreation Kall,
occupying the length and breadth of the building. Close by is the Recreation *
Ground for the Juniors, and a little farther off are the grounds especially set
apart for their great games of Foot-ball, Base-ball, and other sports that require {
more space than is contained in the every-day playgrounds.

All the Students of Notre Dame have pleasing memories of Washington Hall,
The Commencement Exercises are held in ft; and frequently during the year
the students repair to it with pleasure, to be entertained by their fellow-students
with music, declamations and dramatic performances. It is handsomely fitted
up, and is well suited for the purpose for which it was built. On the ground
floor’ is
Wile Seniors* Recreation Hall,
which is properly fitted up for the daily amusements of the Seniors, having on
one side the ordinary recreation yard with Ball Alley and Gymnastic Apparatus,
and on the other, more extensive grounds for the use of those who indulge in

and other buildings directly connected with the College, are in proportion to the
: size of the College. An Observatory is in contemplation, in which will be
I placed the fine refracting
Telescope,
presented to the University by his Majesty, the Emperor of France. It is one
of the best instruments of the size ever manufactured. The focal length of the
instrument is over nine feet, and the diameter of the object-glass six inches
clear. There are two eye-pieces for land objects.' one of seventy-five, and the
other of one hundred, power.
Before leaving this part of our Prospectus relating to Buildings, we must
mention several which, though they are not exclusively for College purposes, do
their part in making up the Establishment of Notre Dame, of which the College
Building is the centre.
Wire CliTircli of Hie Sacredl Heart,
to the west of the College Building, serves as a place of worship to the Cath-
' olics of the neighborhood, to the Students, and other inmates of Notre Dame.
It contains a fine-toned Organ of thirty-two stops. The sacred music per-
formed in this Church is of a superior order. In the Church tower is a peal
of thirty-two bells—the finest peal of bells in the United States;—indeed, the
only one of the kind. The base of the chime is made by the large bell recently
’ imported from France, and presented to the Church of Notre Dame by the
friends of the Institution. Its weight is thirteen thousand pounds, and its di-
ameter, at the base, is eight feet eight inches.
Tlie Manual Labor School,
which deserves a notice apart, has been removed from its former position to give
room to beautify and ornament more extensive grounds in front of the College.
It now stands near the Farm House, and all the Shops have been moved to the
same locality.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	11
Tine Novitiates, and tTte Missionary’s Home,
situated in secluded localities around the lakes, complete the buildings connected
with the College, though we might add to the list the Printing Office of the
Ave Maria, in which is published the journal of that name, and from which,
for ten months in the year, issues The Scholastic Year, a paper edited by the
Students of Notre Dame.
The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums take place. It is divided
into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each Session, a
strict examination of all the different classes is made in the presence of the
Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is ex-
amined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which his previous
attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends on his
application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be found ca-
pable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such promotion is
equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully a strict
examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates of
the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary or Scien-
tific Studies.
The Degrees of Bachelor of Science and of Master of Science will also be
conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to those Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of Ex-
aminers, and given clear evidence of their moral character.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French and
German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully by
persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the Institu-
tion being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times occur for
conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory ev-
idence of their moral standing.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	13
No Student will be received for a shorter period than one session of five

notice, settle all accounts, and supply means to defray all traveling expenses.
Should a Student withdraw himself, or be withdrawn by his parents or
guardians before the expiration of the session, no deduction is made except in
case of sickness or absolute dismissal.

16.	In the Refectory of the Senior Department, and also in that of the Ju-
nior, conspicuous to the eyes of visitors, may be seen the “Tables of Honor,”
presided over by the Vice-President and Prefect of Discipline. At these are
seated twenty-two of the Students whose conduct has been the most exemplary
during the preceding week. They are elected by the unanimous vote of the
Professors and Prefects.	.
17.	Bath Rooms, provided with hot and cold water, are fitted up, in which
the Students take a bath once a week; in warm weather, however, they bathe
twice a week in St. Joseph’s Lake.
18.	On Sunday and Wednesday mornings, the Students must wrap up and
place upon their beds their soiled linen of the previous half week. On Monday
morning, the Students of the Senior and Junior Departments repair in ranks
and in silence to the Dormitories, whence they take their Sunday clothes and
carry them to their trunks. And on Saturday, at half-past three o’clock, they
go in the same manner to the Trunk-room, and bring their Sunday clothes to
the Dormitories. The Students will be reviewed at eight o’clock on Sunday
and Wednesday mornings, with special reference to their personal neatness.
19.	Stationery, etc., will be delivered to Students, as follows: on Mondays

read one day, in order, at dinner and supper. At the end of each meal, any
Student is liable to be called upon to give an account of what he has heard read.
22.	Senior Students will be permitted to read or study from eight to a quar-
ter to nine o’clock, P. M.

Faculty, previous to their being mailed. All letters sent or received may be
opened by the President or Vice-President.
24.	When a Student is sick, he will obtain permission from the Prefect of
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	15

Health to go to the Infirmary, where he must observe the regulations of the
place until his recovery.
25.	No book, periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into the College,
without being previously examined and approved by the Director of Studies.
Objectionable hooks found in the possession of Students will be withheld from
them until their departure from the University.	;
N. B.—Whether in class or in recreation, when permitted to converse at :
table, or during their walks, Students should endeavor to improve the purity of I
their language, and cultivate urbanity of maimers. A few years in College *
would fee profitably employed, if nothing else were learned than to converse and !
behave with the dignity and propriety of gentlemen.	'
The happiness, no less than the improvement of Students, is so closely con- j
nected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the College, that no $
young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own welfare and the ac- '
complishment of his purpose in entering the Institution, can fail to discover the
importance of a^Strict observance of the foregoing Rules. If the authorities of
the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere and unwavering zeal in keeping
those Regulations, they demand of Students nothing more than the promotion
of their own interest

Young gentlemen wishing to enter this Department will find a carefully-
prepared plan of studies, embracing all the departments of Public and Private
'Law, together with the principles of practice and the Law of Evidence.
The complete course will be made in two years, the terms, of which there
are four, corresponding with those of the other faculties of the University. At
the end of the course, students who have passed a successful examination, and
who have in other respects satisfied the requirements of the University, will be
entitled to receive the degree of LL. B.
Students presenting themselves for matriculation in this Department will
be expected to have a good liberal education. Those, however, who may not
have completed their studies in the Faculty of Arts, will have an opportunity of
doing so, without extra charge, while prosecuting their'legal studies.
The proficiency of students will be tested, from time to time, by written
theses and oral examinations, and at the end of each term there will be a gen-
eral examination on all the subjects treated during the term.
Besides the course of general instruction, students will receive every assist-
ance in studying the Laws peculiar to their respective States.
And as it is a matter of the highest importance to a young Lawyer, that on
being admitted to the practice of his profession he should be able to express
himself clearly, fluently, and in a methodical manner, ample opportunities will
be afforded to cultivate the art of public speaking. For this end, and in order
to enable students to acquire those habits of self-command and quickness of de-
cision so characteristic of the learned and accomplished Lawyer, a moot court
will be held from time to time, under the direction of a Professor, at which ques-
tions of Law may be discussed and mock trials held. For the cultivation of
other species of eloquence, still further facilities will be afforded in the Literary
Associations of the University.
Besides the ordinary prizes granted in the different classes, at the end of
each collegiate year, there will also be two grand prizes, of $50.00 and $40.00
each, awarded respectively (subject to the rules and regulations of the Univer-
sity), to the best and second best treatise or discourse, as the case may be, writ-
ten by students of the graduating class, on some subject chosen by the Faculty,
and which will be submitted in due time and form.
Gentlemen intending to follow the course of Law are advised to present
themselves at the beginning of a term, and, if possible, at the beginning of the
first term of the collegiate year, first Tuesday of September. The propriety of
this recommendation will be fully appreciated when it is understood that at
those times preliminary lectures will be delivered, for the purpose of making the
Students attending1 tlie Law Course will have the privilege of consulting
the library, but each one would do well to provide himself with a few of the
leading authors whose works are generally used as text-books. The principal

ones required by students of the first year are: Blackstone’s Commentaries, Po-
thier on Obligations, Bishop on Criminal Law, Cooper’s Justinian, and Burrell’s
Law Dictionary. And in the second year should be procured Kent’s Commen-
taries, Parsons on Contracts, Storey’s Equity Jurisprudence, Story on Constitu-
tional Law, Greenleaf on Evidence, Stephen on Pleading, and Domat on the
Civil Law. The usefulness of these works will not cease with the student’s ca-
reer, but, as they are standard authorities on most of the subjects of which they
treat, they will continue to be of service in subsequent practice. Hence the de=
sirability of acquiring them as early as possible.
The authorities of the University have determined to spare nothing that
can be done by them to place the Law Department on a first-class footing; and
have in contemplation, as soon as circumstances will permit, the erection of a
separate building for the use of students pursuing this Course.
The students will be expected to conform to the rules of the University.
Further information may be obtained by addressing Rev. W. Cobby, S. S. C.,
President of the University.

time, a Debating, Dramatic and Musical Association. Its exercises include
Public Reading, Declamations, Essays and a Moot Court. It has a good li-
brary, and numbers forty members—the elite of the Junior Collegiate Depart-

Hitherto all the Gold Medals, Gold Prizes, Silver Medals and Silver
Prizes, given to the students at Notre Dame, have been given at the expense of
the University. We are, however, convinced that many of our friends would
be pleased to have the privilege of endowing one or more of these Medals which
would bear the name of the donor. Let, for example, $500 be deposited, the
interest of which would purchase one of the Gold Medals given for first honors
and would perpetuate the name of the donor, as a friend of Education and a
benefactor of the Institution. This is no new custom, but one well known even
in our American Colleges and Universities. Many persons admire those who
give their whole life to the benefit of Education, and here we offer an occasion
to these true friends of Education, but whose vocation is not that of professor,
to lend a helping hand and thus become hearty co-operators with those whose
vocation it is to teach. Teachers, fired with an ardent zeal for the success of
their sublime duty, are frequently held back for want of means and the proper
encouragement. Here is a chance to encourage teachers and gladden the hearts
of noble youth who win the honors of their Alma Mater, In like manner
Professorships could be endowed, providing a salary of from $800 to $1500 per
annum. Colleges-'and Universities which are endowed by State or otherwise,
do not feel these wants, but a University like this, which has no endozoment '
whatever, must appeal to its friends for help, which no doubt will be promptly
rendered.

This is the title of a neat little paper, published weekly at the University of
Notre Dame. The chief object of this paper is to keep the parents and friends
of our students informed on the various subjects of study and discipline, as
practiced at this University and Saint Mary’s Academy, and of the progress
and standing of their sons and daughters in these two Institutions. For this
purpose regular weekly reports are given, consisting of the names of those who
deserve by their good deportment to sit at the Tables of Honor, and who by then.’
perseverance and industry deserve special commendation from then- various
professors and teachers. Other reports relative to the arrangement of Classes,
the promotion of the more talented and energetic students, etc., also find place
in this paper and keep parents and friends accurately informed on all that
concerns their children.
This paper also opens a field for aspiring young writers, who might other-
wise, through timidity, allow their talents in this respect to remain inactive ;
while many articles of an instructive and literary character, from writers of

mature mind and ability, render the Scholastic Year a valuable publication
for all who desire variety and utility in their reading. Our little College
paper at present consists of eight large double-column pages, and as soon as a
sufficient patronage will justify its conductors to do so, it will be increased in
size, and thus rendered still more useful and interesting.
Terms : By mail, for one Scholastic year (10 months), $2 00.
To students residing at the College or Academy, one year, special terms.
All who desire a sprightly little paper, full of interest and College news,
especially the parents of our students, who are most interested, should at once
subscribe for the Scholastic Year.

ST. MARY’S ACADEMY,
ONE MILE WEST OF NOTRE DAME UNIVERSITY,
<^HIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are
taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Modern
Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Although particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of Cath-
olic pupils, yet pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of
order, merely required to attend the public religious exercises with the mem-
bers of the Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all Modern Improvements. Every
portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths are attached
to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion' which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are
referred to the “ Fourteenth Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy,” for the
year 1869-70, or address

regular line of omnibuses between South Bend, Notre Dame and St. Mary’s,
which connects regularly with all the trains arriving at South Bend.
