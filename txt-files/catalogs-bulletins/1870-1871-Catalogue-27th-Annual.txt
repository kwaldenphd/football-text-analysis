The University was founded in 1842 by the Congregation Of the Holy
Cross, and was chartered by the Legislature of the State Of Indiana in 1844,
with power to confer all the usual degrees^
The College Buildings ale oh an eminence, near two small, picturesque
lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of the fine and healthy farming region
of the St. Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the river, The College can
easily be reached from all parts of the United States and Canada, by means of
two great trunklines of Rail way,—the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana,
and the Michigan Central; the former passing within a mile of the College
grounds, and the latter connecting at Niles with the recently built Railway
between that place and South Bend, which runs within half a mile of the Col-
lege. At the Michigan Southern Railroad depot, South Bend, omnibuses or
private conveyances can be obtained.
The Buildings are well adapted for the purpose for which they were erec-
ted. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleeping Apartments,
and Recreation Halls are commodious and capable of giving accommodation to
five hundred resident students^
The Site
of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the students.
It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot naturally
beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
Health, and Retirement
that are enjoy'ed by the inmates of the Institutiona description of all-that
pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limits of these pages. We
prefer to give a hearty invitation to all oUr patrons, and to all who think of
confiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge for themselves/
The advantages arising from •
The Retired Position
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart the
education of their children; and even the careless student when once interested
in his studies soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an uninterrupted
attention to class and study. Though secluded in a great measure from the
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	7
busy world without, yet the number of Students and the extensive College
grounds give him a world of his own, in which, what with Class, Examination,
Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Base-ball Clubs, Dramatic
and Musical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment and amusement, and com-
panions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix his mind on his studies and
establish him in habits of piety, application and order—the influence of which
will be felt his entire life. He breathes for a few short years the atmosphere
of order, of regularity in all that he does; of profound application to studies, |
broken only by healthy and regular recreation; and certainly, in our times, |
when serious and solid studies are becoming so rare, when all kinds of induce-
meats to waste and fritter away time are forced upon young Students, when
morals are so lightly watched over, the advantage of the retired locality of
Notre DaxEe cannot be too highly spoken of.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health, and
those who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony that
the regular course of life, added to the salubrious climate, the fresh country
air, has done much to improve the health of their children. In case of sick-
ness, the Student does not remain in the College rooms, but is immediately
taken to the Infirmary, where he is attended and nursed with devoted care by
experienced Sisters, whose attention to the sick needs no recommendation.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
order and regularity. The morals and general deportment of the pupils are
assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal habits receive the
same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own families.
Regulations of the University.
All the Students are required to attend the exercises of public worship I
with punctuality and decorum,	I
As soon as the bell announces the beginning or end of a College exercise,
every one shall repair in silence to the discharge of that duty to which he is I
called.
The time of recreation excepted, silence must be inviolably observed in
all places.
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful toward the I
Professor and Prefects of the Institution—never absenting themselves from
the place in which they ought to be, without permission from proper authority.
Students must carefully avoid every expression in the least injurious to ;
Religion, their Professors, Prefects, or fellow-Students.
Students are not permitted to visit private rooms.
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden.	'
Intoxicating liquors are absolutely prohibited.
Compensation for all damage done to the furniture, or other property of
the College, will be required from the person or persons causing such damage.
No branch of study, once commenced, shall be discontinued without
permission of the Director of Studies.
8	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
No one shall leave the University grounds without the permission of
the President or Vice-President.
Any hreach of pure morals, either in words or actions, must be reported
forthwith to the President or Vice-President.
No one shall keep in his possession any money, except what he receives
weekly from the Treasurer, on Wednesdays, at 9 o’clock A. M. The College
will not be responsible for any valuables, such as watches, money, etc., unless
deposited with the Secretary.
Bulletins are sent to parents every month.
On the first Wednesday of every month, “ Certificates of Good Conduct ”
and “Improvement in Class” are issued by the Faculty to such Students as I
deserve them.
In the Refectory of the Senior Department, and also in that of the Junior,
conspicuous to the eyes of visitors, may be seen the “ Tables of Honor,”
presided over by the Vice-President and Prefect of Discipline. At these are
seated twenty-two of the Students whose conduct has been the most exemplary
during the preceding week. They are elected by the unanimous vote of the
Professors and Prefects.
Bath-rooms, provided with hot and cold water, are fitted up for the use
of the Students during the winter; in warm weather, however, the Students
bathe twice a week in St. Joseph’s Lake.
Stationery, etc., will be delivered to Students, as follows: on Mondays
and Thursdays, at half-past twelve o’clock, to the Students of the Senior
Department; Wednesdays, at half-past seven A. M., to the Students of the
Junior Department. Every Student should have a memorandum book in
which to enter all his receipts and expenditures, and his notes for recitation
in class and for conduct during his stay in college. Books prepared expressly
for this purpose can be obtained from the Secretary.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the Class-room, or who
shall have been guilty of misconduct or breach of rule, will be sent to the
Detention-room during the recreations or the promenades, and required to
prepare their lessons, or perform such tasks as shall be assigned them, and
will be excluded from all College exercises until such tasks be accomplished.
Senior Students will be permitted to read or study from eight to a
quarter to nine o’clock P. M.
Every month all the Students must write to their parents or guardians.
All letters sent or received may be opened by the President or Vice-President.
When a Student is sick, he will obtain permission from the Prefect of
Health to go to the Infirmary, where he must observe the regulations of the
place until his recovery.
No book, periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into the College,
without being previously examined and approved by the Director of Studies.
Objectionable books found in the possession of Students will be withheld from
them until their departure from the University.
Whether in class or in recreation, when permitted to converse at table, or
during their walks, Students should endeavor to improve the purity of their
language, and cultivate urbanity of manners. A few years in College would

be profitably employed, if nothing else were learned than to converse and
behave with the dignity and propriety of gentlemen.
The happiness, no less than the improvement, of Students, is so closely con-
nected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the College, that no
young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own welfare and the ac-
complishment of his purpose in entering the Institution, can fail to discover
the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing Rules. If the authorities
of the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere and unwavering zeal in keep-
ing those Regulations, they demand of Students nothing more than the promo-
tion of their own interests.
General Information.
The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums take place. It is divided
into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each Session, a
strict examination of all the different classes is made in the presence of the
Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is ex-
amined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which his pre-
vious attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends on
his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be found
capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such promotion
is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully a strict
examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates
of the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary or
Scientific Studies.
The Degrees ofLL. B., and LL. D., Bachelor of Science and Master of Science
will also be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their good character.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the
Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times
occur for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
All letters sent and received by Students may be opened and read by the
President or his substitute.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions and By-
Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the Archconfraternity, Holy
10	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,
Angels’, Holy Childhood, Philodemic, St. Edward’s, Thespian, St. Cecilia’s, and
Philharmonic Societies, with which Students are authorized and recommended
to connect themselves.

LAW DEPARTMENT.*
All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included in? the
course. The Code and Common Law systems of Pleading and Practice are
taught. The course of studies in this department embraces, chiefly, Ethics;
Political Economy; Constitutional and International Law; Municipal Law r
Law of Contracts; Equity Jurisprudence; Criminal Law ; Evidence, Plead- ■
ing and Practice.	;
In addition to the general course of instruction, students will receive every
assistance in studying the Laws--peculiar to their respective States.	।
The entire course for those just commencing the study of Law, is intended ;
to be completed in two years divided into four terms which correspond with !
those of the other departments of the University.	0'
Every applicant for admission into this department is expected to have, at ‘
least, a complete English Education. It is very desirable-that he should also '
have a classical training before commencing the study of the Law; neverthe- ■
less, those who may not possess this advantage, will, without extra charge, be 1
afforded ample facilities for acquiring a knowledge of the classics, while prose- 1
cuting their legal studies.	.	*
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time, but
it is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves at the begin-
ning of a Term.	,
The students will be required to pass, through an examination at the close .
of each Term, and also to present an essay, of not more Than seven pages of
legal cap, on some one of the matters which they shall have seen. The notes ;
of these special examinations and essays, as well as those of the application
and general standing of the members in class throughout the Lawr Course, will
be placed to their respective credits in the result of* the final examination for h
the degree of LL. B.	•
■Without entering into details, the order of studies is substantially pre- '
sented under the following general heads.-
First Term.	(
Nature and divisions of Law; Ethics; Common Law and Pleadings; Law
of Contracts as to Personal rights and obligations.	,
UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.	15
S&cotlcL Term,.
International and Municipal Law; Constitutional Jurisprudence of the
United States. Law of Contracts, as to Personal Property. Pleading and
Practice.
Third, T&rm.
Political Economy; Law of Evidence; Criminal Law; Pleading and
Practice.
Fourth Term,.
Law of Real Property; Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure. A general
review.
The hours for classes are, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays,
from 10 to 12 a. m., and from 2^ to 3X p. m.; on Saturdays from 10 to 12 a. m.
Besides the ordinary prizes granted in the different classes, at the end of
each collegiate year there will also be two grand prizes, of $50.00 and $40.00
each, awarded respectively (subject to the rules and regulations of the Univer-
sity), to the best and second best treatise or discourse, as the case may be,
written by students of the graduating class, on some subject chosen by the
Faculty, and which will be submitted in due time and form.
Students attending the Law Course will have the privilege of consulting
the library, but each one is requested to furnish himself with the leading text-
books which are generally used. All the works need not be procured at once,
but the student can supply himself with those of more immediate application
as indicated by his Professor, from time to time, in the progress of the course.
* Among the lext-books principally recommended are, Kent’s Commentaries;
Parson on Contracts; Colyer on Partnership ; Edwards on Bills of Exchange
and Promissory Notes ; Angell & Ames on Corporations; Bishop on Criminal
Procedure; Chitty, and Stephen on Pleading; Washburne on Real Property;
Greenleaf on Evidence; Burrill’s Law Dictionary; Story on Constitutional
Law; Story’s Equity Jurisprudence, and others which can be obtained as
needed. The usefulness of these works will not cease with the student’s
career, but as they are standard authorities on most of the subjects of which
they treat, they will continue to be of service in subsequent practice. Hence
the desirability of acquiring them as early as possible.
The authorities of the University have determined to spare nothing that
can be done by them to place the Law Department on afirst-class footing; and
have in contemplation, as soon as circumstances will permit, the erection of a
separate building for the use of students pursuing this-Course.
The students will be expected to conform to the rules of the University.
Further information may be obtained by addressing Very Rev. W. Corby,
S.S.C., President of the University.

"NOTRE DAME 8CI-IOEASTIC.”
This is the title of a neat little paper published every week, except in
vacation, at the University of Notre Dame. The chief object of this paper is
to keep the parents and friends of our students informed on the various sub-
jects of study and discipline, at this University and at St. Mary’s Academy,
and of the progress of their sons and daughters in these two Institutions. For
this purpose regular weekly reports are given, consisting of the names of
those who deserve, by their excellent conduct, to sit at the Tables of
Honor, and who by their perseverance and industry deserve special commen-
dation from their various professors and teachers. Other reports relative to
the arrangement of Classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic
students, etc., also find place in this paper, and keep parents and friends accu-
rately informed on all that concerns their children.
This paper also opens a field for aspiring young writers, who might other-
wise, through timidity, allow thier talents in this respect to remain inactive;
while many articles of an instructive and literary character, from writers of
mature mind and ability, render the Scholastic a valuable publication for
all who desire variety and utility in their reading. Our little College paper at
present consists of eight large three-column pages, and as soon as a sufficient
patronage will justify its conductors to do so, it will be increased in size, and
thus rendered still more useful and interesting.
Terms : By mail for one scholastic year, $2 00.
To students residing at the College or Academy, one year, special terms.

in each of the above branches. The routine of study in the Coarse of Book-
keeping embraces the following, the whole being completed in one scholastic
year.-—Preparatory Instructions and definitions; Initiatory sets by Double
Entry—1st Series, Embracing the Buying and Selling of Merchandise on
Private account; 2d Series, On Account of others; 3d Series, Buying and Sell-

ducting and closing of Stock and Partnership books—gaining and losing
business, &c., &c. Saturdays are devoted to Commercial Law. For this pur-
pose, “ Parson’s Laws of Business for Business Men ” is used as a text-book, and
the students are required to prepare the lessons the same as recitations in other
classes of the College, Particular attention is paid to the explanation of the
Law of Negotiable Paper.

ANATOMY	MATERIA MEDICA.
Young men desiring to study for-the Medical profession will find oppor-

whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the course of
studies in this department embraces principally Anatomy. The remainder of
the course is completed in some of our neighboring Universities. As a prepar-

[Extract from Scholastic, June 38,1871.]
CONSERVATORY O1P MUe*IG.
| Owing to the large attendance in the Musical Department, which necessi-
i tated that all the time and attention of the teachers should be entirely devoted
| to giving lessons to the pupils, it was found impossible during the scholastic
i year just elapsed to establish firmly and develop the Conservatory of Music as
j intended the preceding year. However, greater facilities and a larger number of
| music teachers will permit us to carry out next session the original plan of this
higher department of music. Students capable of entering the Cmser-
Datory of Music will have to pass an examination in the general theory and
perform on an instrument as required by the resolutions published in the
Scholastic, No. 4, October, 1869. They alone will have the privilege of two
hours’ practice each day, during the study hours, and the same on Wednesday.
I Public soirees will be given by, and under the auspices of, the Conservatory of
; Music at least once a month.	'
The Methods to be used in the Primary Department of Music are the
following :
Organ—Zundel’s.	Guitar—Carcassi’s Method.
Piano—Bellack’s, and Richardson’s.	Clarionet—Winner’s.
Violin—Wichtel’s Series.	Violoncello—Romberg.
Flute—Wragg’s Elute Preceptor.	Contra Bass—Friedheim.
Cornet—Doddsworth.	•	Vocal Music—Conconi, and Bassini.
The courses will be two in number—the Preparatory, comprising five-
classes or grades, each one corresponding to a session, with, however, the
privilege of promotion during the session; the Conservatory, having two classes,
or grades, each corresponding to a whole scholastic year.
In order to enter into the Conservatory Course, studentswill be required
I to know well the theory of music, and be good performers on an instru-
ments: viz., Pianists will be expected to master all the exercises of Richard-
son’s Method; Violinists, the exercises of Wichtel’s Series, and so on with all
the other instruments. The study of Harmony and Composition will be the
special object of the Conservatory.
Prof. Regniers, a graduate of the Royal Conservatory of Music, Ghent,
Belgium, has been engaged for three years to teach Piano in the Music De-
partment of Notre Dame. Prof. Regniers obtained all the first premiums at
the yearly concursus of the Royal Academy,'and studied vocal music under
Cabel, of the Grand Opera of Paris. The Professor is an excellent performer
on the piano, and a remarkably fine vocalist.
60	UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.
PAINTING-	DRAWING.
These two sister branches of Art will be made more than ever the object
of a special attention at Notre Dame. For the Course of Painting and Draw-
ing during the next three years, an able Professor has been secured, and,
moreover, the usual fees have been considerably reduced in the hope that a
greater number of Students will join the Course. '
Mr. J. De Bleye, a distinguished Artist of the Academic Royale des Beaux
Arts, of Antwerp, Belgium, is now at Notre Dame, where he will direct the
Department of Painting and Drawing, assisted by Bro. Albert, S.S.C. Mr.
DeBieye, has an experience of fifteen years as a teacher of Painting; he studied
in the Atheneums and Academies of a country rich in paintings and widely
famed for its Artists, and he will no doubt merit the confidence already placed
in his ability.
The terms for Drawing and Painting—marked $15 per session in the
Catalogue—will be altered as follows for the future:
Linear Drawing and Principles (Per Session)................................. $ 2 50
Architectural, Machine, etc.................................................   5	00
Landscape and Academic....................................................... 10	00
Painting..................................................................... 15	00
All materials except models to be procured at the Student’s expense.
Young men who desire a fine education should give some attention to a
o	o
branch hitherto much neglected in this country, and which, however, ought to
form an integral part of their studies, since it contributes so efficiently to elevate
and ennoble the mind.
ASTRONO MICAL OBSERVATORY.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which the fine
instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been placed. The studies
of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered practically interesting.

a Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Educa-
tion are taught here. Mrrsic especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the
Modebn Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.- :
Although particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of
Catholic pupils, yet pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake
of order, are required to attend the public religious exercises with the
members of the Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious^ suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all Modern Improvements. Every
portion of the building is heated by steam; and hot and cold baths are attached
to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual powers.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both; when they visit their sons and daughters.
