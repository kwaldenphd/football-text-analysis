♦ This distinguished Elocutionist is engaged to give a special course of Lectures and Drill
in Elocution.
In the year 1836, the Rev. S. T. Badin, of venerable memory, while trav-
eling through the northern section of the State of Indiana, visited the spot
now known by the name of “ Notre Dame,” but then lying unnoticed in its
native forest wilderness and beauty. Struck by its loveliness, or, to speak
more correctly, influenced by that Providence which directs the most appa-
rently unimportant events for the accomplishment of its own eternal de-
signs, Father Badin resolved at once to secure this place to the Church as
the site ot a future College. This resolution he executed. Not long after,
it passed into the hands of the Right Rev. Bishop de la Hailandi&re, who
transferred it to the Very Rev. E. Sorin, Priest of the Congregation of the
Holy Cross, who, with a few Brothers of the same Order, had come to America
about a year before. In 1842, they first took possession of it, and in a few
years were enabled, by the blessing of God, to erect spacious College build-
ings, which have been year after year much enlarged and furnished with all
the modern improvements.
Such has been of late the rapid increase of the number of Students, that
the Board of Administration has felt obliged to throw aside all previous
calculations, and to prepare at once ample room to accommodate fully and
comfortably five hundred boarders. To meet every want of that number, a*
new building, 160 feet long, 85 feet deep and six stories high, has been erec-
ted, finished with all the latest improvements of the age,—every thing that
an experience of a quarter of a century has shown to be beneficial and de-
sirable ; also a new Infirmary Building, 100 feet long, 50 feet deep and three
stories high ; a Music Hall of the same dimensions, Recreation Rooms, and
an Exhibition Hall.
To the already spacious grounds very large additions have been recently
made, which are being artistically laid out in landscape form, thus at once
affording excellent means for physical development, and the cultivation of
refined taste.
This Institution was incorporated by an Act of the State Legislature of
Indiana, in 1844, under the name and style of “University of Notre Dame,”’
and empowered to confer Degrees in all the learned Professions.
The University of Notre Dame is situated in the lovely Valley of the Saint
Joseph, scarcely a mile from that river, and on the banks of two beautiful
lakes of pure spring water. It is in the midst of a fine and healthy farming
region, and by means of two great trunk lines of Railroad,—the Michigan
Central and the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana, the latter passing
within a mile of the College grounds—is easily and quickly accessible from
every part of the country. At the Michigan Southern Railroad Depot, at
South Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained. Besides
B	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
this, a stage passes the College twice a day, connecting with the two lines
of Railroad. In the city itself there are large and commodious hotels, w'here
every comfort may be enjoyed.
The University is conducted by the Fathers of the Congregation of the
Holy Cross ; a number of highly competent Lay Professors assist in the various
branches of Studies $ other Teachers and the Prefects of Discipline are sup-
plied by the Brothers of Holy Cross, who are, like the Fathers, devoted by
their sacred calling to the education of youth.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
the most perfect order and regularity. The morals and the general deport-
ment of the Pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and per-
sonal habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their
own families.
The Tables of Honor, Weekly Notes, Monthly Certificates, Quarterly Bul-
letins, Semi-Annual Examinations and Annual Distribution of Premiums are
among the many means made use of to excite emulation and a love of study
in the minds of Pupils and reward the diligent.
Experience constantly proves that a young man may be kept within the
line of duty more by a sense of honor and justice., than	fear qf punishment „
Catholic parents may rest assured that the most zealous care will be taken
that their children comply regularly with their religious duties, and that no
'efforts will be spared in instructing them fully in the principles and obliga-
tions of their Holy Religion.
Although all the members of the Faculty and other College officers profess
the Catholic Religion, Students belonging to any other denomination are
received; nothing is required of them, in this respect, but to assist, for uni-
formity’s sake, at all the public and regular exercises of Religion with pro-
priety and decorum.
The Pupils are divided, according to their age, into the Minim, Junior and
Senior Departments, each having its separate dormitory, study-hall, class-
rooms, play-grounds, etc., its complete Gymnasium, with its own Prefects
and Teachers.
The Institution possesses a valuable Library of about seven thousand
volumes, besides three other smaller Libraries for the use of the different Col-
lege Societies, a complete set of Philosophical and Chemical Apparatus, a
Museum of Natural History, and a rich Collection of Plants.
This year the Astronomical Department has been enriched by the addition
of a Telescope of rare worth, an imperial gift from his Majesty, Napoleon III.
Among the peculiar advantages which this Institution presents, as a place
of Education, may be noticed-*-
1	.—Its Retired Location. At & time and in a country where serious and
solid studies are rare; where dissipations of every kind are thrown in the
way of the young Student; where visitors often interrupt the course of the
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
student; and where morals are but slightly watched over, it seems that every
parent who desires to secure to his son an opportunity of spending the few
years of his education usefully and profitably, and passing safely the danger-
ous season of early youth removed from all the temptations of our large
cities, should readily comprehend the advantage of placing him in such an
Institution as Notre Dame. Here, the young student is under the most
watchful and parental care; here he can apply himself, undisturbed, to his
studies, under competent Professors, and may acquire a solid knowledge of
every thing to which he may wish to devote bis attention; here also, his
young mind breathes an atmosphere of piety, the influence of which will
hover around him throughout life.
2	.—Its Extensive Grounds. If Students are here deprived of hurtful
pleasures and dissipation which abound in large cities, they are amply remu-
nerated by those delightful and innocent amusements which the nature of
this locality so abundantly provides. Nearly one thousand acres of land are
attached to the College, and are well laid out, both by nature and art, for
College purposes. Whilst the moral and intellectual culture of the Students
is attended to with all possible care and solicitude, their physical develop-
ment is by by no means neglected, Two ball-alleys, two ten-pin alleys, three
gymnastic apparatuses, lately built with much ingenuity and skill, together
with a variety of the latest and most interesting games, viz: foot-ball, cricket,
etc., tend alike by their judicious use to invigorate the body and recreate the
mind. Moreover the extensive forests surrounding the College give the best
opportunities to those who are fond of hunting, whilst the two beautiful
Lakes, upon whose banks the University stands, afford choice opportunity
for fishing, boating and bathing in summer, and almost uninterrupted skat-
ing during winter. No one for a moment can doubt that these manly sports
are highly conducive to the health and happiness of Pupils. All Educators
know that innocent, exhilarating and somewhat exciting amusements are the
best safeguard of morals for children, especially for young men.
3	.—The Care taken in Sickness. Students, when ill, have not to remain
in the College Rooms, but are immediately taken to the apartments of
the Infirmary, where they are attended and nursed, with devoted care, by ex-
perienced Sisters, who strive to supply the place of their absent mothers.
An eminent and experienced Physician—a graduate of the “ Ecole de Mede-
cine” of Lyons, France—-resides permanently in the College.
The last scholastic year has been marked with a success unprecedented in
the annals of the Institution, the average number of Pupils greatly exceed-
ing that of any former yean
The different-Departments have likewise been more fully developed, both
in reference to classes and discipline. The Faculty is also more efficient and
more numerous than before.

lastic session, viz: in September or February, but Pupils are admitted at all
times during the year, and their session commences with the date of their
entrance.
When Parents wish to have their children sent home, they must give timely
notice, settle all accounts, and supply means to defray all traveling expenses.
Should a Student withdraw himself, or be withdrawn by his parents or
guardians before the expiration of the session, no deduction is made, except
in case of sickness or absolute dismissal. .

The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
Conferring of Degrees and the Distribution of Premiums take place. It is
divided into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination, of each
Session, a strict examination of all the different classes is made in the pres-
ence of the Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is ex-
amined by the Director of Studies, and placed in that class for which his
previous attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends
on his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be
found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such
promotion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully a
strict examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred? on each of the graduates
of the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary or
Scientific Studies.
The Degrees of Bachelor of Science and of Master of Science will also be
conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to those Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their moral character.
Students who do not desire to graduate, may adopt a partial or irregular
course, fitting them for Commercial life, for Civil Engineering, &c., or for
any pursuit outside of the Learned Professions, which requires a special train-
ing. Such a course would run parallel with the regular course, and would
include all the advantages, literary and otherwise, which the Institution offers
to all its inmates.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the
Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times
occur for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
All letters sent and received by Students may be opened and read by the
President or his substitute.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAM1
N. B.—Whether in class or in recreation, when permitted to converse at
table, or during their walks, Students should endeavor to improve the purity
of their language, and cultivate urbanity of manners. A few years in College
would be profitably employed, if nothing else were learned than to converse
and behave with the dignity and propriety of gentlemen.
The happiness, no less then the improvement of Students,- is so closely
connected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the College,
that no young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own wel-
fare and the accomplishment of his purpose in entering the Institution, can
fail to discover the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing Rules.
If the authorities of the University eshort all to exhibit a sincere and
unwavering zeal in keeping those Regulations, they demand of Students
nothing' more than the promotion of their own interest.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions
and By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the Archconfra-
ternity, Holy Angels’, Holy Childhood, Philodemic, St. Edward’s, Thespian,
St. Cecilia’s, and Philharmonic, Societies with which Students are author-
ized and recommended to connect themselves;-

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	G9
ST. MARY’S ACADEMY,
[-ONE MILE WEST OE NOTHE DAME UNTVERSITYj
CT HIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
-St. Joseph River, is every thing that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are
taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Mod-
ern Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of Catholic pupils.
Pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of order, merely
required to attend the public religious exercises with the members of the
Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
"requirements of the day, and furnished with all Modern Improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths
are attached to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
•charming seclusion which is so favorable to the 'healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions "io each other is a great convenience
to parents having-children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are
•referred to the “ Eleventh Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy,” for-the
year IS&tblZ, or address

THE FRENCH LANGUAGE.
The French Language is now one of the branches which are required to
be pursued by those who follow the Scientific Course and though Latin or
German may be taken as an equivalent yet wTe wish to impress upon the minds
of parents and students the great importance of the study of this beautiful .
tongue. The intercourse between France and America is becoming more
intimate, year by year; and even at present the majority of American youth -
look forward with more certainty and pleasure to the time w’hen they
shall visit Paris and France than they do to any event that may happen during j
their travels in other parts of the world. A knowledge of the French lan- |'
guage has indeed become a necessary part of a polite and of a professional ! ‘
education. The United States government has recognized this fact, by re- i;
quiring that the French tongue shall be taught in the army and navy schools
of the nation. At Notre Dame the facilities for becoming thoioughly and
practically acquainted with the French language and literature are unrivaled, ।;
the Professors in this department being natives of France and teaching their ! I
pupils to speak the language fluently as well as to read and write it correctly. 11
It is hoped that during the coming year the classes in. French will be much '
larger than usual.	i
The higher classes of the French course wrill be taught exclusively in ;
French.	|
THE GERMAN LANGUAGE..	!
i
The importance of the study of'German is so generally felt and acknowl-
edged that it is unnecessary for us to insist upon its advantages. It is noW
a necessity for every one who would be a thoroughly educated business man.
We have accordingly placed this language among the studies of the Com-
mercial course, earnestly hoping that every young man- who wishes to grad-
uate in this department as master of a complete business education will not
fail to make himself well acquainted with the German tongue. The j
facilities at Notre Dame for learning to speak the German language fluently,. 1
are equal to those enjoyed by the students of the French department. The
Professors are natives of Germany, and th© language is taught in class as a
living tongue; the recitations in the advanced classes are always conducted
in German, and the pupil has thus the means of learning to speak the lan-
guage like a native. The German classes in the University have always been
large and numerous ; and we have good reasons for believing that during
the coming year the number of those studying German will be even greater
than usual;	I

MUSIC.
Great attention lias always been given at Notre Dame to Vocal and In-
strumental Music ; and so successful have been the efforts of the Officers of
the University, and the teachers of Music to develop a taste for this elegant
art that the number of those taking lessons in Music is now so great as to
form of themselves a separate department for the study and practice of the
art in all its branches. It is but a few years since a large hall was built and
supplied with instruments for the exclusive use of this department; but dur-
ing the past year the number of music pupils has largely increased ; and it
I is now found necessary to provide more ample room for their accommodation.
| During the last year the brass band was the largest and finest ever known
at the University. Among the projected improvements for the coming
year is an appropriate music hall for the especial use of the band; this will
leave more room for those students who pursue other branches of music.
j	DRAWING AND PAINTING.
’ The number of students who take lessons in drawing, is now, and has been
for some years quite large, and their productions have always been among
the most pleasing objects of interest to the visitors, at the annual Common ce-
J ments. An artist of acknowledged merit, has been engaged for the coming
j	O'OO
| year, who will give lessons in painting, and add a still greater impulse to
! the study of this beautiful art at Notre Dame.
I	CHEMICAL LABORATORY.
: i This is one of the principal improvements to be undertaken during the
j coming year. It is designed to be complete in every respect, both as to the
• building itself and the material and apparatus necessary to illustrate the
j principles and laws of the Sciences of Chemistry and Mineralogy, and to sup-
ply the means by which Students may become thorough practical Chemists.
THE NEW TELESCOPE.
The University has just been made the recipient of a fine refracting
Telescope, presented by his Majesty the Emperor of Erance. It is one of
the best instruments of its size ever manufactured, and when mounted in the
new Observatory will give a great impetus to the study of Astronomy and the
• higher Mathematics. The focal length of the Telescope is over nine feet,
and the diameter of the object glass six inches clear. There are two eye-
pieces for land objects, one of seventy-five, and the other of one hundred
power; and five eyepieces for celestial observations, whose powers range
from seventy-five to four hundred. The Observatory for the reception of this
instrument will be built immediately, after the most approved models; and,
besides the Telescope, will be furnished with a transit instrument and a sid-
1 erial clock. Advanced students in Astronomy will be instructed in the use
of the instruments, and have an opportunity to participate in the observations.

UNIVERSTY OF NOTRE DAME.
THE GREAT BELL.
Not among the least of the attractions of Notre Dame for the next year
■will be the magnificent bell, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, which was pre-
sented to the Church of Notre Dame, by the friends of the institution. Its
■weight is 13,000 lbs, and its diameter at the base is eight feet, eight
inches. Morning, noon, and evening, and again at the hour of retiring to
rest, the whole country round about will be filled with the grand aerial voice
of one of the largest and finest bells in the New World.
COURSES OF STUDY.
There exist at present in the University three prescribed courses of study ;
the classical, in which students are graduated as Bachelors of Arts; the
Scientific, in which students are graduated as Bachelors of Science; and the
Commercial, in wdiich students receive the diploma of Master of Accounts.
These courses are complete and thorough in their several departments; and
every student on entering the University will be required to take up one of
the prescribed courses and follow it until he graduates or leaves the Univer-
sity. The studies i,n each course have been arranged with care, and students
will make more rapid and thorough progress in their education by following
a regular plan of study, than by taking up at hazard whatever branches
they may fancy at the beginning of each year.
The particular attention of Parents and Guardians is called to this
matter; and they are requested to specify what course of study they desire
their children to pursue. If the student is not yet advanced in age, and
has a reasonable prospect of spending a few years at College, we would
earnestly advise that he should pursue the Classical Course. There is no
extra charge for Latin and Greek. But, in any case, each student will be
required to follow one of the three regular courses, as laid down in the
Courses of Study.
WEEKLY BULLETINS.
It will be gratifying to parents and Guardians to learn that in future
they wTill receive ■weekly in the Journal of the Institution a bulletin of sev-
eral pages written by a special committee with the view to keep them informed
of wThatever may interest them at Notre Dame and St. Alary’s. The weekly
news of two such Institutions would fill up a Journal of no ordinary interest
to those for whom it is intended as will appear from a few of the chief head-
ings, viz: New Arrivals, Table of Honor, Health of the Institution, Celebra-
tions, Visits of distinguished Personages, Extraordinary and Meritorious
Compositions, or Progress, Monthly Honorable Mentions, Promotions, and
whatever may give our patrons an insight into the life of their children
or wards. If it be true that -whatever affects a child always interests his
parents, we may wTell say that in the course of a Collegiate year, there are
a thousand items which our friends will like to read and communicate to
their neighbors, wrhilst to gut pupils it will be a pleasure and a new7- incite-
ment to virtue, to know that their parents will read such a bulletin every week.
