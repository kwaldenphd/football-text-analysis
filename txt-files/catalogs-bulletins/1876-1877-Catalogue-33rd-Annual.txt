University of Notre Dame.
THIS UNIVERSITY was founded in 1842, by the Congregation of
Holy Cross, under the direction of Very Rev. E. Sorin, and was
chartered by the Legislature of the State of Indiana in 1844, with
power to confer all the usual degrees.
The College buildings are on an eminence near two small picturesque
lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of the fine and healthy farm-
ing region of the Saint Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the
river. The College can easily be reached from all parts of the United
States and Canada by means of three great trunk lines of railway—
the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, the Chicago and Lake Huron,
and the Great Western and Michigan Central ; the former passing
within a mile of the College grounds, and the latter connecting at Niles
with the recently-built railway between that place and South Bend,
which runs within a half mile of the College. At the Michigan
Southern Railroad depot, South Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances
can be obtained.
The buildings are well adapted for the purposes for which they were
erected. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleeping
apartments and Recreation Halls are commodious, and capable of
giving accommodation to five hundred resident students.
THE SITE
of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the
Students. It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering
a spot naturally beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution—a description of
all that pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limit of
these pages. We prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons,
and to all who think of confiding their sons to our care, to come and
see, and judge for themselves.
PROSPECTUS.
The advantages arising from the
RETIRED POSITION
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at
heart the education of their children; and even the careless student,
when once interested in his studies, soon finds out the benefits he can
derive from an uninterrupted attention to class and study. Though
secluded in a great measure from the busy world without, yet the
number of students and the extensive College grounds give him a world
of his own, in which, what with Class, Examination, Notes, Literary
Societies, Religious Associations, Baseball Clubs, Boat Clubs, Dramatic,
Musical. Literary and Scientific Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment
aud amusement, and companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur
to fix his mind on his studies and establish him in habits of piety,
application and order, the influence of which will be felt during his
entire life. He breathes for a few short years the atmosphere of order,
of regularity in all that he does ; of profound application to studies,
broken only by healthy and regular recreation; and certainly in our
times, when serious and solid studies are becoming so rare—when all
kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time are forced upon
young students—when morals are so lightly watched over—the advan-
tage of the retired location of Notre Dame cannot be too highly
spoken of.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health;
and those who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony
that the regular course of life, added to the salubrious climate and the
fresh country air, has done much to improve the health of their children.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to
preserve order and regularity. The morals and general deportment
of the pupils are^ assiduously watched over, and their comforts and
personal habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom
of their own families.
THE EDUCATION
given at Notre Dame is calculated to form both the heart and intel-
lect of the students. Every attention is given to their moral and reli-
gious culture. Every day the students have an opportunity of attend-
ing classes where they may acquire a knowledge of Christian Doc-
trine. Twice a week, lectures and instructions on religious topics are
delivered to all the students together. Finally, a regular course of
IO	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Dogmatic Theology is established in the University for the benefit of
the more advanced students, who may desire to enter the world having
their minds stored, not only with profane science, but also with what
is much more important—a thorough knowledge of their religion.
The religious instruction is, of course, confined to Catholic students.
The intellectual training is carried on with care and diligence by the
officers and Professors of the University. The best systems of teaching
are adopted, and the best authors for each branch selected, so that no
pains are spared to secure the objects which the University has in view
as an institution of education.
THE MINIM DEPARTMENT
For the care and training of children under the age of thirteen, there
has been established a Department distinct from, and independent of,
the University; it is known as the Minim Department, and has ever
been one of the greatest objects of interest to persons visiting Notre
Dame. The pupils in this Department, unless for their out-door sports,
pass the day entirely under the care of Sisters who take a tender and
motherly care o their young charges.
All the elementary branches of an English education are here taught,
together with French and German. Also, for the Minims, Music (piano)
is not an extra. In order to develop this Department, and thereby
extend the advantages it affords for the forming of the young heart, a
reduction of $25 a session (of five months), has lately been made in
favor of the Minims.
Not the least considerable of the advantages enjoyed by the pupils
of the Minim Department is their complete separation from the larger
students. The discipline to which they are subject is much milder
than that of the students more advanced in age.
REGULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
All students are required to attend the exercises of public worship
with punctuality and decorum.
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful towards the
Professors and Prefects of the Institution—never absenting themselves
from the place in which they ought to be, without permission from
proper authority.
Students must carefully avoid every expression in the least injurious
to religion or morals, their Professors, Prefects or fellow-students.
PROSPECTUS.
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden, and intoxicating liquors are
absolutely prohibited.
Compensation for all damage done to the furniture or other property
of the College will be required from the person or persons causing such
damage.
No branch of study, once commenced, shall be discontinued without
permission from the Director of Studies.
No one shall leave the University grounds without the permission of
the President or Vice-President, or the one delegated to represent them.
Students are expected to take baths regularly.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the class-room, or
who have been guilty of misconduct, must perform such tasks as may
be assigned them, and shall be excluded from all College exercises until
such tasks be accomplished.
No book, periodical, nor newspaper shall be introduced into the
College without being previously examined and approved by the
Director of Studies. Objectionable books found in the possession of
students will be withheld from them until their departure from the
University, or destroyed.
All letters sent or received by students may be opened by the Presi-
dent or his representative.
GENERAL INFORMATION.
The academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September,
and closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Com-
mencement, the Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums,
take place. It is divided into two Sessions of five months each. At the
termination of each Session a strict examination of all the different
classes is made in the presence of the Faculty. There is no vacation at
Easter.
When a student presents himself for admission into the College he is
examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which
his previous attainments may have qualified him. His further promo-
tion depends on his application and progress. Should any student,
during the year, be found capable of passing to a higher class, he will
be promoted, and such promotion is equivalent to the honors of the
class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the
students as shall have completed the Classical Course, and passed sue-
12
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
cessfully an examination in all the branches of the course, before the
Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the grad-
uates of the first degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to
literary or scientific studies, and shall have sustained satisfactorily an
appropriate thesis. Students desiring to receive this degree should
make application in writing.
The degree of LL.B., as also those of Bachelor of Science, Master of
Science, and Civil Engineer, will be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course and passed a satisfactary examination before the
Board of Examiners. In all cases, students receiving diplomas are
supposed to be of good moral character.
No student will receive a Diploma or University Honor of any kind
until such time as all indebtedness to the Institution shall have been satis-
factorily settled.
Special facillities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the
French and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught
very carefully by persons of acknowledged competency, but also there
is every opportunity for conversation in these tongues.
All students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence their moral standing.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions and
By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty: such as the Archconfra-
ternity, Holy Angels, Holy Childhood, Saint Aloysius Philodemic,
Classical, Scientific, Thespian, St. Cecilia, Columbian, St. Stanislaus
Philopatrian, and Philharmonic Societies, Cornet Band and Orchestra,
with some of which students are recommended to connect themselves.
W In case of sickness the student does not remain in the College
rooms, but is immediately taken to the Infirmary, where he is attended
and nursed with devoted care, by experienced Sisters, whose attention
to the sick needs no recommendation.

All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included in the
Course. The Common Law System of Pleading and Practice is taught. The
Course of Studies in this Department embraces, chiefly, Constitutional and
International Law, Municipal Law, Law of Contracts, Equity Jurisprudence,
Criminal Law, Evidence, Pleading and Practice.
For the purpose of acquiring a practical as well as a theoretical knowledge
of the legal profession, the students shall, during the Course, be required to
argue cases, draw up pleadings, and conduct Law and Chancery suits accord-
ing to the rules and formalities of regular courts of justice.
As it is a matter of the highest importance to a young lawyer that, on being
admitted to the practice of his profession, he should be able to express himself
clearly and fluently, full opportunity will be offered for cultivating the art of
public speaking. As one means of attaining this end, and for the purpose of
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
I'
familiarizing the student with the practical workings of his future profession,
Moot Courts, under the direction of a Professor, will he frequently held during
the Course. For the cultivation of other kinds of eloquence, still further
facilities are afforded in the various Literary and Debating Societies of the
University.
The entire Course for those commencing the study of the Law is intended
to be completed in two years, divided into four terms, which correspond with
those of the other departments of the University.
Every applicant for admission into this Department is expected to have at
least a complete English education. It is very desirable that he should also
have a Classical training before commencing the study of the Law; neverthe-
less those who may not possess this advantage will without extra charge be
offered ample opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of the Classics while
pursuing their legal studies.
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time, but it
is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves at the begin-
ning of a term.
The students will be required to pass an examination at the close of each
term, and to present an essay of not more than seven pages of legal cap on
some of the matters which they shall have seen, and furthermore to give proof
of proficiency in Rhetoric, English Literature and Logic, before being allowed
to graduate. The notes of the special examinations and essays, as well as
those of the application and general standing of the members in class through-
out the Law Course, will be placed to their respective credits in the result of
the final examination for the degree of LL. B.

i

Post-Graduate Course.
The students in this Course occupy themselves with Philosophy, History,.
the Natural and Physical Sciences. Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering
may he optional studies of the Course.
Law Department.
We trust to see our Law Department better and better attended year after
year. We have every reason to be proud of the young men who each year
have sought the classic retirement of Notre Dame to pursue their Law
Studies. We shall endeavor to make their sojourn among us an agreeable
one, and give them every facility for study.
Civil Engineering.
This important Course is now thoroughly established, and will afford our
advanced students the opportunity of fitting themselves for the practice of the
eminent profession whose name it bears.
Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame to promote
the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is so frequent and neces-
sary for business or scientific purposes. To facilitate this study, no extra fee
is now exacted.
The German language—the classes of which are so numerously attended—
will be taught by three Professors during the next scholastic year. The
number of German students attending the University is becoming greater
every year. The French language—though more especially the language of
the Collegiate Course—will be of great advantage to the Scientific students.
Other languages—such as Italian and Spanish—may be taught when required.
Phonography and Telegraphy.
These two branches invite the special attention of the students of the Com-
mercial Course. The Telegraph Department is fully organized, and placed
under the management of a skilful electrician. Notre Dame is now in direct
communication with South Bend and the rest of the world by electric wires.
Anatomy and Materia Medica.
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find opportu-
nities to do so at Notre Dame. Yet, owing to the want of a sufficient museum
whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the Course of
Studies in this Department is limited, and embraces principally Anatomy.
The remainder of the Course is completed in some of our neighboring Univer-
sities. As a Preparatory Course, that which is given here, under L. Neyron,
M.D., leaves nothing to be desired.
SPECIALTIES.
31
Drawing and Painting.
The Drawing Classes each year show a large increase over the preceding
years. The University enjoys means adequate to all demands in this branch.
It possesses a large number of models in all sorts of drawings, a fine Studio,
and vigilant and zealous teachers of the art.
Painting promises, likewise, to be one of the popular branches of Art taught
at Notre Dame. The famous painter, G-regori, of Rome, has been engaged to
give instructions in oil painting. G-regori has no superior in Rome.
Music.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has five Professors,
and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory system. An Orchestra
of fifteen pieces, with an excellent Quartette, and a Brass Band of twenty-five
instruments, are some of the leading features of the Musical Department.
Vocal music receives special regard. We call the attention of our students
and patrons to this favorite and useful branch of music, which is now so
deservedly popular. At present it may be studied free of charge.
Astronomical Observatory.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which the fine
instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been placed. The studies
of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered practically interesting.
Libraries.
The College Library contains some thirteen thousand volumes, very care-
fully arranged by the Librarian. Donations of books, especially to the Law
Library, will be thankfully received.
The Circulating Library was commenced three years ago with four hundred
volumes. It now numbers over three thousand. All the Libraries which
formerly belonged to the Literary and Religious Societies have been merged
into it. Instead of the dozen or more book-cases which often hid away in-
structive books, a beautiful collection of Literary, Religious, Historical and
Scientific works is now open to the students in an apartment fitted up as a
Reading-Room.
Lecture Course.
There are a great many students who, owing to different causes, progress
but slowly in the acquisition of knowledge in the class-room, but who in the
lecture-hall advance most rapidly, whilst all gain a more comprehensive and
practical perception of the various branches of Science when clearly and
concisely elucidated by the discourse of an expert. The importance of
Lectures has, therefore, never been overlooked at Notre Dame, but of late the
authorities of the University have been led to devote particular attention to
the organizing and developing of Lecture Courses on all the different important
studies of the Institution. Henceforth, therefore, students may expect to have
every facility, without any interruption of classes, to assist at regular Lectures
on Philosophical, Historical, Literary and Scientific subjects. In this respect,
the success reached during the past two years forms an epoch in our educa-
tional training, and there is every reason for believing that the future will
witness still greater triumphs.

The Museum contains a well arranged collection of minerals, embracing all
the different ores and rock-formers; specimens of minerals used as gems and
ornaments; a fine selection of geodes, quartz crystals, agates, amazon stones,
spars, etc., besides a valuable collection of fossils illustrative of the different
geological ages, and specimens of rocks from the different formations. There
is also a fine Herbarium, containing upwards of five thousand species of plants
from different parts nf rhe world, including a very choice collection of plants
from Europe and New Zealand, many rare"ferns, marine plants, etc. The
Fauna of Europe and America are also well represented. All the specimens are
so arranged and classified as to be of the most service in lectures and class
instruction.
The Physical Cabinet contains a very complete set of instruments of the
most approved construction. A number of them were on exhibition at the
Centennial, and obtained for their exhibitors a medal and diploma. It is con-
stantly receiving additions in every department, but special attention is dis-
played in selecting instruments for lecture purposes, as illustrated lectures on
scientific subjects, now constitute one of the most interesting features of the
regular course of lectures.
The Laboratory has all the appliances necessarv for the successful teaching
of general and analytical chemistry. Arrangements are being made for
enlarging it, and having it in every respect meet the requirements of the in-
vestigator in organic or inorganic chemistry.
The authorities of the College gratefully acknowledge contributions to the
Museum from Mark M. Foote, of Burlington, Iowa; James B. Crummey, of
Lake City, Col.; the Kansas Railroad Co. ; Bro. Camillus, C. S. 0.; Mrs.
O. Seymour, of Chicago, Ill.; Mr. T. Shortiss, of Toronto, Canada; Mr. R.
Rheinboldt, of Cincinnati, Ohio; D. A. Curran, Gold Hill, Nev., and others.
is the title of a neat 16-page paper published every week during term time
at the University. This journal opens a field for young aspirants to literary
fame, who might otherwise for want of a proper medium allow their tal-
ents in this line to remain inactive. It also contains many articles of an in-
structive and literary character from writers of mature and acknowledged
ability, thus rendering the Scholastic a valuable publication for all who
desire variety and instruction in their reading. During the past scholastic
year there have appeared in its pages nearly a hundred interesting Biograph-
ical Sketches of men of note in Literature, Science, Painting, Sculpture, etc.,
Essays in prose and verse, and notes on Art, Music and Literature, gleaned from
the best sources It will be the honest endeavor of the Editor, during the coming
year, to merit the encouragement given the paper in the past, and the high en-
comiums bestowed upon it by first-class papers among the weekly press.
In addition to its literary features, the Scholastic attaches to itself a
local importance to students, to their parents, and to all who have in former
years attended class at the University, by a weekly summary of events trans-
piring at Notre Dame, by personal notices of the old students, weekly Rolls
of Honor, Class Honors, and lists of excellence. Reports relative to the
arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic
students, etc., will also find a place in this paper, and keep parents and
friends accurately informed on all that concerns their children.

ST. MARY’S ACADEMY,
(One Mile West of Notre Dame University,)

THIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are
taught here. Music, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Modern Lan-
guages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the religious instruction of Catholic pupils.
Pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of order, merely
required to attend the public religious exercises with the members of the
Institution.
The buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all modern improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths are
attached to the sleeping apartments.
The grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are referred
to the Twenty-Second Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy, for the year
1876-7, or address,
ST. MARY’S ACADEMY,
Notre Dame, Indiana.
N.B.—The friends of the Academy|will be pleased to learn that there is
a regular omnibus line between South Bend, Notre Dame and St. Mary’s,
which connects regularly with all the trains arriving at South Bend.
