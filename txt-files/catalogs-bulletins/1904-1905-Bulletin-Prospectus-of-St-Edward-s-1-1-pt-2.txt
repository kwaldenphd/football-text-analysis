HISTORICAL
In building the University of Notre Dame, the
founders sought to make it a home from which the
benefits of Christian education might be spread to the
youth of the land. Realizing, however, that, to enter
the university proper, a certain standard of excellence
must first be reached, it was decided that such a degree
of excellence as was required could be obtained better
here if a preparatory school were maintained in connec-
tion with the university. It has been found that, when
students come here after completing their preparatory
course in High Schools or in Academies, they would be
qualified thoroughly enough in some studies, whereas
in others they would be rather deficient. Thus a
student that might enter as a Freshman in some
studies, might be two or three years behind in others,
and he would be held back to make them up. But by
making the initial and preparatory courses at an
institution in which the student could follow along to
graduation in one of the collegiate courses, much time
and troubled is saved and a pupil will have a better
foundation for his work. Since the opening of the
University therefore, it has been free to students
desiring preparatory education as well as to those that
desire to persue more advanced studies. From this
combined preparatory and academic school grew the
separate schools, and eventually St. Edward’s Hall was
erected as the junior part of the preparatory department
of the University. During the first year of its existence
the school was in charge of lay teachers; but in 1863
the Very Rev. Father Sorin, who during his lifetime
took great pride in this department, decided that it
would be more advantageous to have the pupils in charge

of Sisters. Accordingly, Mother M. Angela, the famous
foundress of the Order of the Sisters of the Holy Cross
in America, was entrusted with the organization of the
school as we have it to-day.
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
St. Edward’s Hall is the preparatory department
of the University of Notre Dame. To this school,
established for the special care and training of boys
under thirteen years of age, the most scrupulous
attention has always been paid by the President of the
University. It is also known as the Minin Department.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all
the elementary branches of an English education
is here imparted, together with a rudimentary knowl-
edge of Latin, French, Spanish and German. Vocal
Music, Elocution, Military Drill, Physical Culture and
Drawing involve no extra charge. The pupils of this
department are taught by the Sisters of the Holy
Cross, who are noted for their efficiency as teachers.
Some special studies, such as Elocution, Physical
Culture, Military Drill, Gymnastics and Debating, are
taught by regular professors of the University.
The boys are always under supervision. From the
day of their entrance they are made to feel that they are
not strangers, but the children of the house. Three
Brothers of the Holy Cross preside in the sleeping
apartments, gynasium and natatorium; accompany
them on their walks; and, in general, see to them
during the recreation hours. The presence of the
Brothers, however, is far from being a restraint on the
amusement of the boys ; for while it is the duty of the
prefects to insist that their young charges shall always

keep within the limits of the strictest propriety, they,
at the same time, take part in all sports, organize
games, and do everything in their power to foster the
love of healthy exercise.
St. Edward’s Hall is unique in the completeness of
its equipment. It affords the pupils the rare advan-
tages of the University and the tender care of the
Sisters The fact that the boys come from the best
families, and from all over the country, and that among
them are the sons of former Minims, is sufficient
evidence of the advantages afforded by St.
Hall.

DESCRIPTION*
St. Edward’s Hall is located in the northeast corner
of the University group of buildings, a little to the north
of the Academy of Music and east of the Main Building.
It is a large, four story, brick building, one hundred and
fifty feet long and sixty-five feet wide. In the Chapel,
the corridors and the parlor, are paintings of the cele-
brated Signor Gregori. The various rooms in St.
Edward’s Hall are large, well lighted and well ventilated.
The ceilings are sixteen feet high. The building is
heated throughout by steam, lighted by electricity, sup-
plied with hot and cold water. No fire is used in any
part of the building. Bath rooms are connected with
the sleeping apartments. The equipment is, in every
respect, as thorough and as up-to-date as carefulness
and a generous expenditure of money can make it.
One of the things that most readily appears to the eye
of an observer is the order and scrupulous cleanliness
on all sides. Even in the play rooms, where it might
be expected that young boys might leave things in a
careless condition, everything is as neat and orderly as
one would find in a well conducted home.
On the east end of the building is an annex, two
hundred and fifty feet long, which does not show in the
cut of the hall. It is divided into a library, game
rooms, play hall, gymnasium, athletic club rooms,
clothes rooms, etc. Thus it may be seen that the facili-
ties offered to the young boys for spending recreation
hours in a manner most suitable to their age and tastes
are as complete as possible.
Fronting the buildings is St. Edward’s Park, which,
s¥. Edward’s haTi..
i3
with its rare trees, plants and gorgeous flower beds, is
considered the most beautiful portion of the University
grounds, which have attracted attention as the grandest
college grounds in the country. This cut gives but a
small corner of St. Edward’s Park, as it has been impos-
sible for us to get a photograph of the whole grounds.
The hall, with its annex, has a frontage on this park of
four hundred feet.

EDUCATION.
O’
*
The education imparted in St. Edward’s Hall is
practical and thorough. It combines the advantages of
old methods, which long experience has proved to be
beneficial, with the best that modern notions of educa-
tion suggest. It is intended to train the heart as well
as the mind, to form young gentlemen, who will be an
honor to their parents and to society. Every attention is
given to the moral culture of the students; and their
general deportment is equally the subject of unremitting
care. Knowing that the charm of refined manners is
the aggregate of habits acquired in youth, the teachers
fail not, on all occasions, to point out and take means
to correct faults committed against gentlemanly de-
portment. Instructions in politeness and etiquette are
given once a week.
St. Edward’s Hall welcomes to its advantages
pupils of every denomination; but anything like an
attempt to force the religious convictions of non-
Catholics is carefully avoided. For the sake of uni-
formity and the preservation of discipline, all the pupils
are required, at stated times, to attend divine services
with the student-body in the College Church. All,
Catholics and non-Catholics, are taught to appreciate
moral worth. Surrounded as the students are by all
that tends to ennoble and elevate, it would seem hardly
possible that one should spend even a year at Notre
Dame without acquiring greater love and respect for all
that pertains to a nobler life.

THE COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
The courses of instruction in St. Edward’s Hall
were planned with a view to giving pupils a broad
foundation for commercial studies or for university edu-
cation. They include Christian Doctrine and Bible
History, (for Catholic Students), Reading, Ortho-
graphy, Geography, Arithmetic, Grammar, Penmanship,
United States History,Composition, Algebra, Elocution,
Drawing, Music, Phonography, Typewriting, Physical
Culture, Military Drill, Latin, Greek, German, French,
Spanish and Spanish-English. On entering the student,
the parents decide with the Prefect of Studies the
course the boy is to follow, and the studies are taken
up accordingly.
The students of the first-class complete the follow-
ing studies : Brooks’ Normal Higher Arithmetic, Har-
vey’s Grammar, Advanced Geography, Beitzel’s
Advanced Speller, History of the United States,
Reading, Penmanship, Latin, Algebra and Composition
for two sessions. So thoroughly do they master these
studies that it has been invariably found in the exami-
nations held at the end of the preparatory course to
determine the eligibility of students for entrance into
the collegiate courses that those boys who came from
St. Edward’s Hall were easily superior to the young
men who had prepared themselves in other schools.
Being thoroughly trained for every line which they are
to follow in the next years of their college life, these
ex-Minims take the lead at the entrance examinations,
hold it all through their course, and are frequently the
pnes on-whom class honors fall.

THE COURSES IN MUSIC.
The department of Music is in the second story of
the building. It consists of a large room for vocal
classes, and a number of other rooms, each containing
musical instruments for lessons and daily practice.
Instructions on the piano, violin, mandolin, guitar,
flute, cornet and banjo are given by able teachers. Each
pupil devotes an hour daily to music, including a
private lesson of fifteen minutes. To secure that the
pupils do not waste their time, as they are apt to do
when left to themselves, a Sister is on duty at all times
to see that they practice faithfully. General vocal les-
sons are given once a week.
DEPARTMENT FOR LITTLE BOYS.
At the request of parents who desire their children to
make their initial studies in St. Edward’s Hall and to
continue them at Notre Dame until completion, a
separate department has been opened for boys under
seven years of age. They have a special study hall,
separate class rooms and sleeping apartments, and a
dining room in which food specially prepared and
suitable for them is served. The hours for sleep and
study are arranged to suit their tender age. But while
their hours of study are few, it is remarkable how rapidly
these little boys progress. When they have completed
their thirteenth year they are usually found to be as far
advanced in their studies as the ordinary boy of
sixteen,

ST. EDWARD’S HADE.
SORIN CADETS,
The Sorin Cadets are divided into two companies
under the command of an ex-drill instructor of the
United States Army. The companies are armed with a
light carbine rifle weighing less than four pounds.
These rifles and the other equipment are kept in a room
fitted up as an armory. The drill, which is of a light
nature, is practiced twice a week in the large play hall;
but in favorable weather it is conducted outdoors.
Great attention is paid at all times to the setting up of
boys. An upright and manly bearing is the result of
the drills which are, no doubt, beneficial to both mind
and body. Boys of the most efficient class, who show
an aptitude to command, are selected and promoted to
fill the different positions of non-commissioned officers.
At the close of the scholastic year a gold medal is
awarded to the boy who has the highest number of points
to his credit for proficiency and deportment.
DISCIPLINE.
Continued and varied experience in the care and
training of young boys has brought about the system of
discipline now enforced in St. Edward’s Hall. Certain
restrictions must necessarily be laid upon pupils of their
age, and rules of conduct must be formulated which
they must strictly obey. Yet every liberty that is com-
patible with careful training, and every privilege con-
formable to their proper development, is granted to the
Minims. Those in charge realize that childhood is the
most impressionable time of life, and that the effects of

early training are lasting. Therefore it is sought to
influence the Minims by such methods only as will de-
velop in their youthful minds a ■ love for order and
rightful conduct, a proper respect for parents and supe-
riors, and a taste for such habits as will bring them honor
in after life. Every care is taken to see that they are
kept from all that would in the least taint their morals,
and that they are taught to strive after such virtues and
manly habits as will make them estimable young men.
As in a well regulated home, recourse is had to kindness
rather than severity. The Sisters feel that they fill the
place of the absent mother. The discipline is thus
more like the regulation of an orderly home than like
the strict mandates of a boarding school. To keep the
pupils impressed with the love and respect they owe
their parents, they are required to write to them at least
once a week.
As an incentive to keeping the.rules, an honor sys-
tem has been established. At a conspicuous place in
the hall a Tablet of Honor is placed, on which are in-
scribed the names of those whose conduct has been
conformable to all teachers. There is great rivalry
among the boys to have their names app.ear on the Tab-
let. A gold medal is also awarded at the end of two
full years to those whose deportment has been excep-
tionally good. As this fact is made known to the
Minim immediately after his entrance, he generally
endeavors to shape his conduct with a view'to receiving
an Honor. It has been found that such incentives as
these are far more effectual toward the develop-
ment of character than corporal punishment. This latter
method finds no place in St. Edward’s Hall, for seldom,
if ever, is it employed.
The Minims are kept within the line of duty by a
sense of honor and justice rather than by fear of punish-
ST. ward’s HAIX.	2t
ment. Among the many means of promoting emulation,
are Weekly Notes, Reports published in the Scholastic,
Bi-Monthly Bulletins, Annual Distribution of Premiums
and Gold Medals for excellence in studies.
The President of the University frequently visits St.
Edward's Hall ; and once a month he examines all the
classes to ascertain the progress the pupils are making
in different studies.
The order of the day in St. Edward’s Hall is as
follows : Rising at six-forty A. m., toilet, etc.; breakfast
at seven, after which a short time is allowed for recrea-
tion and exercise; at half past seven, studies and classes
are begun and continued without intermission until half
past nine; from half past'nine until ten, recreation is
given and a luncheon is served. At ten, classes are
again taken up and followed until eleven forty-five,
toilet; twelve, dinner, followed by recreation ; from one
until three, study and class ; three, recreation and
luncheon ; from half past four until half past six, study
and classes ; half past six, supper, followed by recrea-
tion ; eight o’clock, retiring.
From this it may be seen that the work has been
arranged as judiciously as possible toward furthering
mental and physical development at the same time.
The pupils are never at work more than two hours at a
time. This gives them ample opportunity to take such
recreation as boys of their age require, and perhaps to.
this is due. the fact that they are s j healthy and happy.
. The recreation and exercise in the fresh air after each
two hours of study unbind the mind and prepare the
boys to return to work with a freshness and vigor that
does very much toward their progress.

SOCIETIES.
There are two societies in the Minim department,
that of the Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which
has for its object to supply servers for the Church ser-
vices, and the Sorin Association which has been estab-
lished with a view to give the pupils a start in elocution
and debating as early as possible. This society is
presided over by one of the professors who finds it a
pleasant duty to train these interesting young speakers.
Meetings are held once a week after school hours.
These meetings are a source of pleasure as well as of
profit to the young enthusiasts. Not infrequently are
they honored at these meetings by the presence of some
of the University officials who take pleasure in attend-
ing, to encourage them and watch the development
they are making. The members prepare original com-
positions, deliver declamations, are trained to debate,
etc. As a further encouragement for this young literary
society, a gold medal is annually awarded at commence-
ment t:me to the one who has done the best work, and
who shows his merit in open contest. This society has
the honor of furnishing the representative who delivers
the greetings from St. Edward’s Hall to the President
of the University on President’s day.

The main Study Hall for the more advanced pupils
in St. Edward’s is located on the second floor in the
center of the building*. It is a large room, well lighted
and well ventilated, commanding a charming view from
each of its many large windows. The hall presents
quite an artistic appearance, being tastefully decorated
with beautiful statuary, rare pictures, potted plants, etc.
Besides the pleasure the students derive from studying
in this bright, beautiful Hall, their tastes are cultivated
by coming in contact with objects so refining,

THE CLOTHES ROOM.
The clothes room is an important apartment in St.
Edward’s Hall. In this each pupil has his wardrobe.
Sisters are constantly in charge. They attend to the
mending, etc., see to the personal neatness of the boys,
take charge of the trunks on the arrival of the pupil,
mark and take an inventory of the clothing, etc., which
they place in the lockers assigned to him. The boys
have free access to the clothes room at all hours; and
they receive from the Sisters the clothes they may need
from time to time. Clothing is changed to suit the
seasons, and it is the duty of one of the prefects to see
that the boys follow this rule. Often when the
temperature suddenly changes in one day, they may be
made to change heavy clothes for light, or light for
heavy clothes. Underwear is changed once a week.

THE LAVATORIES*
The lavatories, supplied with hot and cold water, are
located on the lower floor near the clothes room so that
they can be conveniently reached at all times either
from the campus, from the clothes room, or from the
athletic dressing rooms. The Minims are obliged to
make their toilet here before every meal, and Sisters
are present to assist and to see that it is properly done.
All are required to brush their teeth carefully. Baths
are taken once a week or oftener as parents may direct.

THE DORMITORIES.
The sleeping apartments are all commodious and
well ventilated. Each one is presided over by a
Brother. The most noticeable thing in connection with
these dormitories is the immaculate cleanliness that
prevails all through. The beds have springs with
the ordinary mattress, and over this is placed a
hair mattress. Bedding is provided in abundance
during cold weather. There is nothing lacking to keep
the boys comfortable. Bath rooms with hot and cold
water are connected with the sleeping apartments.

THE INFIRMARY.
So seldom is it that any of the boys of St. Edward’s
Hall are sick that no special infirmary has been found
necessary for them. When occasionally it happens that
one of them is indisposed he is put in charge of the
Sisters at the University Infirmary and is visited, jf
necessary, by the house physician.. In case of sickness
the boy’s parents are immediately notified.
Since the health of the student is of primary
importance, the sanitary regulations enforced are of
the most practical nature. Special attention is given to
the choice and to the preparation of food, to the hours
for rising and retiring, to meals, study, recreation, to
the rules affecting personal regimen, etc. The pure air,
the regular life, perfect open plumbing, the extensive
grounds, which afford abundant opportunities for
exercise,—all contribute to the proverbial good health
of the Minims.

THE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS IN THE ANNEX
TO ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
The principal object the authorities had in adding
this annex was to furnish places where the Minims could
spend their recreation hours when the weather is too
inclement to permit them to be outdoors. On this
account much attention was given to the furnishing of
the
GYMNASIUM,

found running ladders, rings, punching bags, horizontal
and parallel bars, turning poles, climbing poles and
ladders, Swiss ladders, dumb-bells, clubs, weights,
springboards, mats, horses, pyramid frames, etc. This
apartment is now used merely as a practice room since
the building of the large University gymnasium*, as the
boys go there for gymnastic instruction. Next in
importance to the gymnasium is the
PLAY HALL,
a large room one hundred and ten feet long andjthirty
feet wide. Here all such games as basket-ball, indoor
base-ball, hand ball, etc., are played, and here, in fact,
is where the Minims spend many happy hours when the
weather is too severe for outdoor sports. The hall is

READING ROOM
is thirty feet long and twenty feet wide. This, like the
game room, is tastefully decorated with potted plants
and pictures. It contains a library of many hundred
volumes, especially suited to the age of the pupils. The
books include the best authors in travel, history, biog-
raphy, poetry, and fiction ; as well as bound encyclo-
pedias, magazines, papers received from home, etc.
The Reading Room is accessible at all recreation hours.

THE MINIM'S CAMPUS.
The campus, which is set aside for the exclusive use
of the Minims, is a level eight-acre field, and is directly
north of their play hall. It is located on the brow of
St. Joseph’s lake, thus commanding one of the best
views of the many splendid scenes at Notre Dame.
This field is a place of great activity during those
seasons in which outdoor games may be played. There
are several baseball diamonds on which, during the
warm weather in spring and summer, organized teams
battle Tor championship honors in the national game
and for the medals awarded to the champion nine.
Then there are four gridirons where enthusiastic
football players develop their muscles in the great

campus is also well supplied with swings, May-poles,
turning poles, a tennis court, a large toboggan slide for
the winter, and many other apparatus with which the
Minims may spend their recreation hours in an enjoy-
able manner. That they take advantage of the oppor-
tunities afforded can readily be seen if one makes a
visit to their campus. Homesickness is almost unknown
among the boys. The new students become readily
acquainted with their class-mates and their surround-
ings, and from the first join in the games and sports.
They realize that they are in a new world where they
have more freedom and enjoyment than they could
possibly have at home. Baseball suits, bats, balls, and
masks are furnished gratis.

ATHLETICS*
Young boys need a great amount of vigorous and
wholesome exercise when they are required to do much
mental work. Study is wearing enough on any person,
but for the youth, who does not directly see the benefit
of it, application to books is doubly tiresome. He
measures greatness more by the standard of sports than
by education and culture. To satisfy his longings for
games, his desire to match his skill and strength with
his fellows, he must be given ample opportunity to
engage in contests. Thus will his mind be relieved of
the strain that study would naturally put upon it. It is
evident that a suitable amount of play will sharpen the
intellect and render its possessor much more competent
ST. EDWARD’S HATD.
43
to work in a beneficial manner. Again play develops a
strong constitution, physical strength, agility of body
and confidence in one’s own ability. This is particularly
true of young boys, who are so susceptible of training.
Bearing these facts in mind, the authorities of St.
Edward’s Hall have made every possible provision to
give the boys sufficient time for athletics. It must not
be inferred, however, that they are permitted all play
and no work. Only during recreation times can there
be any attention given to the subject of games and
athletics, and these are never allowed to interfere in any
way with class work. Every game is encouraged at its
proper time, but when the hour for study comes all
games must be stopped.
Baseball and football are the chief sports among
the Minims. In spring there are as many as eight
different nines competing for the championship of the
hall. The rivalry among these various teams is very
great. Toward the close of the season the two teams
with the best record play a series of five games and to
the winners of this- series go the honors. Each member
of the team is presented with a gold medal. In football
the rivalry is equally as great, except that the strongest
team usually plays most of its games with the boys from
Carroll Hall, and with junior teams from South Bend.
The building in which the swimming pool is located
is a commodious one, ninety feet long, forty-five wide
and two stories in height. The pool itself is fifty-seven
feet in length, twenty-three feet in width, six and a half
feet in depth at one end. The water is lowered on days
reserved for the Minims. On the same floor as the
swimming pool are eighteen needle and shower baths,
bath tubs, and closets, all up-to-date. A student before

degrees Fahrenheit, and lighted by electricity. A man

st. Joseph’s lake.
In warm weather the Minims are allowed to go
swimming every day in St. Joseph’s lake. Of all sports
this is the one the young boys particularly enjoy. How-
ever, they are never permitted to go unless in company
with the Brothers. There is absolutely no danger, and
no accident has ever occurred among the Minims.
They cannot go beyond certain posts, and care is taken
that they do not remain too long in the water. Any
one who is affected by a cold or who is otherwise indis-
posed is not permitted to swim in the lake or in the
natatorium.

THE ADVANTAGES OF ST. EDWARD'S HALL.
The advantages of having a separate department at
the University for boys under thirteen years of age are
so many and so evident that it would seem almost
unnecessary to mention them. In the first place, if
parents are desirous of having their sons sent away to
school when they are of such tender age, they must
fully realize that special care and attention should be
given to these young boys. However, it would be a
difficult matter to make special provisions for them,
unless they be kept alone and be under the supervision
of prefects and instructors that can devote their whole
time to caring particularly for them. It would be
practically impossible to make any deviation from the
ordinary curriculum in order to benefit them if they
were permitted to be among the other boys ; for dis-
criminations in any department, as among men in the
world, always work unsatisfactorily.
Again, the intimate association of such young boys
with older ones does not always lead to the best results.
Whatever they notice in their elders they will strive to
imitate, but it too often happens that they notice only
the rougher side of their companions’ actions. Boys
under the age of thirteen years, it must be remembered,
can not be expected to use very great discretion or
judgment in shaping their actions, and the evil influence
of one thoughtless person may leave a lasting impression
on their youthful minds. Another advantage in having
the Minims by themselves is this : their studies, their
manner of spending recreation, and their tastes in

general are very different from those of the more
advanced boys. They can do better in class-work if
they follow such lines as are specially planned for them,
and they will enjoy their games much better if they are
where they can play them without interference from
older boys. Life in St. Edward’s Hall is thus made
more home-like for them since the rules and regulations
are especially suited to their best interests. There are
a hundred and one little things that go to make up their
comfort and happiness, that could not be taken into
account if they were not in a separate department. They
enjoy not only the special privileges of their own hall
but also those of the older students—public lectures,
concerts, games, etc. The Minims are made to feel
that they are the privileged ones at Notre Dame. As
has been already stated, the Sisters of the Holy Cross
are in charge of St. Edward’s Hall. They give the
most scrupulous attention to the needs and comforts of
the pupils in all that pertains to studies, health and
personal neatness. None better than they know how
to take the place of the mother in the training, the pro-
gress and the happiness of those under their care.
When placing their sons at Notre Dame, parents
find great satisfaction in seeing that, if they have made
a sacrifice in depriving themselves of their children’s
company, they are leaving them in a beautifnl home
surrounded by every care and comfort, and, at the same
time, affording them an opportunity of laying a deep
and solid foundation for an education that will increase
their usefulness and happiness through life.

Minim Department.
St. Mary’s Academy.
(One Mile West of the University of Notre Dame.)
Pupils who need primary education and those of
tender age, are here carefully prepared for the aca-
demic and advanced courses. For the care and
training of these younger pupils there has been
established a separate department to which the most
scrupulous attention has always been paid by the
Sisters in charge of the institution. Great care is
taken to see that these minims have every privilege
and every comfort that is compatible with proper
training.

The
Notre Dame Scholastic
Is the title of a neat 28-page paper, devoted to
the interests of the students, and published by them
at the University every week during term. time.
This journal opens a field for young writers who
might otherwise, for want of a proper' medium,
allow their talents to remain inactive. It also affords
students an opportunity for practical experience in
journalism. During seasons of special interest at the
University, The Scholastic is published daily.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the
coming year to merit the encouragement given the
paper in the past, and the encomiums bestowed upon
it by the press in general.
The Scholastic will be sent to any address for
$1.50 per annum.
