'	ADVERTISEMENT
TO	’
' PARENTS AND GUARDIANS.
The Tenth Annual Calendar of the University of Notre Dame
du Lac, is sent forth to the parents and guardians of students now
receiving their training in the Institution, and to the friends of a
liberal and Catholic education in the North-West, with many
thanks for the large and generous patronage which the University
' has hitherto received, and in the indulgence of the well-grounded
belief that, with each accruing year, the establishment will more
and more strengthen its claims upon the favorable estimation of
the public. Ten years only have elapsed since the Fathers of the
Holy Cross first set foot upon the present site of the University,
' * g then a wild and tangled forest, and began their labors for the dif-
fusion of a Christian education in Northern Indiana. The success >
with which those labors have been rewarded, and the evidences of
Divine approbation and furtherance which the progress and pros-
perity of their institutions have afforded, leave them no room to
doubt that the future will exhibit the same ratio of improvement
and advancement as the past. If they confidently anticipate for
their schools a continually increasing share of public attention and
consideration, they are but relying upon the Divine favor and
benediction which they have thus far so perceptibly enjoyed.
Within the year past great additions and improvements have
8
been made both to the facilities for imparting instruction, and to
the course of study itself. The College Library has received an
accession of abouf five hundred volumes, more than one-half of
which were obtained by the Very Rev. President during a recent
visit to Europe, and were selected under his own eye, with a spe-
cial reference to the necessities of the institution. The philoso-
phical apparatus, the already large collection of botanical speci-
mens, and the mineralogical cabinet, have been very considerably
increased. A course of study in logic and metaphysics has been
inaugurated, under circumstances that promise a high degree of in-
terest and efficiency to this important department of collegiate in-
struction. The Commercial Course has been placed under the
care of a gentleman who, for twenty years, has given his attention
to the theory and practice of book-keeping, and who gives instruc-
tions in conjunction with, and under the direction of the Vice-Pre-
sident of the Institution, himself an accomplished book-keeper.
The chair of Mathematics has been just accepted by J. O’Leary,
Esq., long a mathematical instructor in the Royal College of May-
nooth, in Ireland, and under whose faithful and able tuition, some
of the first mathematical scholars in this country have been form-
ed. The directors of the University cannot withhold an expression
of satisfaction on account of so valuable an accession to the Facul-
ty as that of Professor O’Leary, nor fail to augur from it the most
happy and beneficial results. A class in Elocution has been cre-
ated, consisting of all the senior students, who declaim publicly in
the presence of the students and Faculty, each evening immediate-
ly after prayers, in the order of an alphabetical list, and are- pub-
licly ? criticised by the Professor of Eloquence. Vocal and Instru-
mental Music continue to receive the same attention as heretofore.
The gentleman in charge (Prof. Girac) of this department is al- ■
ready too welkknown for his eminent musical ability and fidelity
as. a teacher, to require special mention at this time. The French,.
9
German, Hebrew, and Arabic languages, along with the usual
classical course in Latin and Greek, are taught by persons every
way competent to ground the student thoroughly in the principles
of these tongues. In a word, in all the branches of a solid and
liberal education, the Directors of the University have mainly in
view the mastery by the student of principles. To this end, much
reliance is placed upon those diagrams and illustrations which the
teacher draws, as- occasion requires, upon the black-board^ and in
which he appeals at once both to the ear and eye of the pupil. It
is found that studies so simple and elementary as even Geography
and English Grammar, can be surrounded with a singular attrac-
tiveness and interest by the employment of this method of instruc-
tion.
The numbei’ of students at the University never was so great as
now; and numerous other indications of prosperity point to a fu-
ture in which the Institution will have realised, and more than
realised, all the most sanguine hopes of its friends.

The Female Academy of St. Mary is located in the village of
Bertrand, Mich., five miles north of the University of Notre Dame
du Lac, and four from the town of Niles. The buildings are neat
and commodious, and the various branches of a polite and useful
education are taught by French and American ladies of excellent
accomplishments, who have embraced the occupation of instructing
the young from religious motives. The number of students has
been steadily increasing since the foundation of the Institute, and
now includes the children of the most respectable persons, both in
the neighboring towns and in remote sections of the country. The
ladies who conduct the school confidently appeal to the numerous
friends of the Institution, whose children or wards were educated
at the Academy, for testimony on behalf of the thoroughness^ and
fidelity with which they execute the trusts committed to them.
The various accomplishments—French, Music, and Drawing—are

15
taught by persons of acknowledged capability; while the more use-
ful and solid branches receive a more than usual share of attention
and care. .
The lines of rail-foad stretching in every direction, and reticu-
lating the face of the country in Southern Michigan and Northern
Indiana, have rendered the Academy of St. Mary, as well as the
University of Notre Dame du Lac, accessible from the most dis-
tant regions of the Union. Bertrand is now within fifty-two hours7
journey of the City of New York, within a ride of three hours
from Chicago, seven or eight from Detroit and Toledo, and twelve
or fifteen from Cincinnati. These advantages, together with the
high character of the education imparted by the good sisters, can-
not fail to secure for the Academy of St. Mary a large and aug-
menting degree of patronage.
