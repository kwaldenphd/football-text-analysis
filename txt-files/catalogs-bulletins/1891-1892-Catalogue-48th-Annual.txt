Historical.
'~THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME has by degrees
reached its present rank and standing among the educa-
J tional institutions of the country. It was founded in the
year 1842, by the Very Reverend Edward Sorin, now Superior
General of the Congregation of the Holy Cross; in 1844 it was
chartered by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana. It
grew rapidly from a small frontier school to a fairly equipped
college, and at length assumed the proportions of a University.
On April 23, 1879, five of the college buildings wTere destroyed
by fire. The loss included the library, museums, and scientific
apparatus. The progress of the University, however, was
arrested but for a short time. In September, 1879, some of the
colleges had been rebuilt, and the beginning of the present
extended group of buildings had been made. The new order
of things fulfilled a hope rather than a promise of the old, and
the Notre Dame of to-day, with its equipment, its standard of
studies, and its increasing influence, more than realizes the most
sanguine expectations even of those who had the firmest belief
in the possibilities of higher education in the West. A brief
review of the
Material Equipment of tlie University
seems not inappropriate.
Main Building. This is five stories high; its dimensions are
320x155 feet. The distance from the ground to the electric
light just above the statue surmounting the dome is 207 feet.
This building contains museums, the libraries, art galleries, class
rooms, study halls, dormitories, lavatories, trunk rooms, arm-
ories, etc. The refectories are richly ornamented with mural
paintings, representing many of the most celebrated Ecclesiasti-
cal and Secular buildings in the world, and beautifully7 illustrat-
ing the progress of architecture. The lavatories are supplied
with hot and cold water, and have all the customary accomoda-
IO

tions. The armories contain about 150 stand of arms, with
bayonets, accoutrements, etc. These arms were procured from
the State, for the service of members of the military organiza-
tions. The reception parlors, and offices of the President, Sec-
retaries, and Prefect of Discipline are on the main floor, as are
also the study-halls, several of the class-rooms, the telegraph
office, and the students’ office. This floor is tiled and the cor-
ridor is lined with a series of superb mural paintings (the work
of the distinguished Roman artist, Signor Luigi Gregori), which
illustrate the leading events in the life of Columbus, or, more
particularly, such of them as history associates with the dis-
cover}^ of America. Portraits of distinguished eccelesiastics,
including almost all the Catholic Bishops in the United States,
those living as well as those who have gone to their reward, line
the walls of the corridors on the floor above, and it is appropri-
ately called the “Bishops’ Gallery.” The society-rooms are on
the same floor, as are also some of the class-rooms; they are
tastefully ornamented with paintings, mural decorations, and
busts of noted personages. Two large dormitories are likewise
on this floor. The Lemonnier Library and Memorial Hall are
on the third floor. Two large dormitories, that correspond in
size and appearance to those below, occupy the rest of the floor.
The music-rooms of the vocal classes and the Department of
Drawing take up the greater part of the fourth floor. The
Lemonnier Library contains 35,000 volumes, besides miscella-
neous objects of interest gathered from all.parts of the United
States, and many other countries. Three wide oaken staircases
afford communication between the different floors, from the first
story to the top of the building; and these, supplemented by
exits to the roofs of verandas and porticos, with ample means of
descending safely to the ground, remove all danger of personal
injury in case of fire. But the fullest precautions have been
taken to guard against that peril. With a watchman constantly
on duty, water on each floor and hose at hand, there is abso-
lutely no danger of fire. The halls throughout the building are
wide, high, and spacious. The many angles which distinguish
the building, were planned and constructed in accordance with
the prevailing style of architecture at Notre Dame, which is

known as modern Gothic. These angles serve to give strength
and solidity to the entire building, rendering it secure against
the fury of the wind and storm, not to mention the incidental
advantages of good light and perfect ventilation which they
afford. Just east of the Main Building is
Music Hall. This is 170 feet in length by 100 in width, and
over 100 in height. The first floor is divided into recreation
and reading rooms, the north end being for the students of Car-
roll Hall, and the south for the students of Brownson Hall.
These rooms are supplied with newspapers, periodicals, games
of all kinds, billiard-tables, etc. The dressing rooms of the
Bicycle Club and of the Athletic Association are also on this
floor. The second and third floors at the north end are divided
into music-rooms, and instrumental music of all kinds is there
taught. The Exhibition Hall occupies the remainder of the
building. In it are given the more formal lectures, as well as
concerts and dramatic entertainments. Fully furnished with the
scenes, accessories and decorations appropriate to such uses,
and capable of accommodating 1,200 persons, it ranks among
the largest and most attractive college halls in the country.
Science Hall. This imposing edifice is situated a few steps
south of Music Hall. The dimensions are 104x131 feet, and
the height is three stories, or 75 feet. It is divided into two
departments, and supplied with all the agencies requisite to
facilitate the acquisition of a complete knowledge of the sciences.
The laboratories, lecture-rooms, museums, biological depart-
ment, engine-rooms, etc., are admirably arranged for the con-
venience of students. The Hall is fully equipped with all
necessary chemicals, preparations, specimens, charts, tools,
instruments, and the innumerable accessories of a great school
of science. 'The Brownson Hall campus or play-ground, a level
tract containing about ten acres, lies south-east of it, South
of it is the
Institute of Technology, a large and commodious building
devoted, to the use of the students of civil, mechanical and elec-
trical engineering. It is fully equipped with all the appliances
for wood and metal working, and is supplied with the most
approved forms of forges and cupolas for blacksmithing and

foundry work. The rooms for mechanical drawing, and the lab-
oratories for special experimental work in mechanical engineer-
ing, were specially designed for the purpose for which they are
used, and are complete in all their appointments. Directly
south is the
Astronomical Observatory, which is conveniently situated
for astronomical observations and the work of class instruction.
The observatory consists of a main part, with a revolving dome,
an east wing, or transit room, in which is mounted the transit
instrument, and a north wing, or computing room, which con-
tains the smaller instruments and the works of reference for the
use of observers. East of Music Hall, for the accommodation
of the students desiring to take physical exercise when the
weather is unfavorable for out-door sports, stands the
Students’ Play Hall, which measures 160 feet in length and
45 in width, and is two stories in height. The north half is for
the use of the students of Carroll Hall, whose campus sur-
rounds it, while the south half is set apart for the students of
Brownson Hall. A thoroughly equipped gymnasium has
recently been fitted up on the second floor of the Institute of
Technology. Just north of the Play Hall and Music Hall is
St. Edward’s Park, and fronting this, facing south, is
St. Edward’s Hall, a building four stories high, and 155 feet
in length by 50 in width. This is for the exclusive use of pupils
un-der thirteen years of age. It is entirely separate from the
University, though under the same general management. The
building is new, and lacks none of the appointments suggested
by experience as useful or desirable. It is divided into study-
halls, class-rooms, dormitories, etc. The recreation hall is just
east of it, while farther east and north lies the play-ground.
The pupils are under the immediate direction of competent and
experienced teachers—Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy
Cross.
The Infirmary adjoins St. Edward’s Hall on the west. In
dimensions it is 100x45 feet, and three stories high. The Gen-
eral Office occupies a portion of the first floor. The rooms on
the floor above are kept in readiness for the reception of stu-
dents who at any time are prevented through illness from attend-

ing classes and discharging their customary duties. The regu-
lar physician of the University, and the Sisters in charge minis-
ter to the sick in all cases.
The Church stands a little west and south of the main build-
ing. It is generally regarded as one of the most beautifully
decorated churches in the country. In size it is 275 x 120 feet,
and the distance from the ground to the apex of the roof is
about 125 feet. It is richly ornamented with paintings and
statuary, and hours may profitably be given to the examination
and study of these and the multitudinous objects of interest and
beauty in which it abounds. In its tower is the largest bell in
America. Besides, there are 32 small bells in the tower.
These vary in size and constitute the noted “chimes of Notre
Dame.” South and west of the church stands
Sorin Hall. The style of the building is what is currently
called mixed Gothic and Roman. The height from the ground
to apex is about 70 feet. It has a measurement of 144 feet
along its front, or from north to south, while in depth, or from
east to west, it will measure, when completed, 112 feet. The
basement, about two-thirds of which is over the ground level,
has a height of 9 feet from floor to ceiling. Above the base-
ment the structure rises to the altitude of three stories. The
distance from the first floor to the ceiling is 15 feet; from the
second floor to the ceiling, 13 feet, and from the third floor
to ceiling, about 12 feet. Two wide and substantial staircases
afford ample means of passing readily from floor to floor. The
basement is sub-divided into lavatories, bath-rooms, boiler and
engine rooms, etc. The building is heated throughout by an
automatic self-feeding apparatus placed in the basement. On
the first floor are two or more of the principal offices, a chapel,
law lecture room, moot-court room, law library, society rooms,
etc. A large room in the north part of the building serves as a
chapel, while the law rooms are south of the entrance, with an
east and south exposure. The second and third floors are
almost exclusively appropriated for students’ rooms. The
building is commodious, thoroughly ventilated, and the rooms
and corridors are well lighted, and comfortably heated at all
times.
14
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
A regularly established United States post-office is situated
on the University grounds, a short distance from the main build-
ing. It is particularly intended for the accommodation of the
University and St. Mary’s Academy, and all mail matter intended
for the inmates of either institution should be addressed to
Notre Dame, Ind. There are too many buildings at Notre
Dame to receive detailed notice, indeed so numerous are they,
that if brought together, they would cover at least, eight or ten
acres of ground.
Surr oun dings.
The University is situated about a mile and a half north of
the flourishing city of South Bend, Ind., and about eighty miles
east of'Chicago. It is surrounded by a fertile and prosperous
farming country. And yet, by reason of its proximity to South
Bend, it combines the conveniences and accommodations of the
city with the salutary isolation, wholesome climate, and natural
beauties of the country. A broad avenue runs directly south
from the University for a mile or more, and on both sides for
half the distance, it is lined with shade trees. North and west
of the University are two beautiful lakes—St. Joseph’s and St.
Mary’s. The area of the former is but a little less than 23 acres.
The ground slopes picturesquely down to the lakes, and beau-
tiful walks along the shores almost surround them. On the
higher ground, above the walks, and overlooking the lakes,
are magnificent groves of oak, hickory, sycamore, and other
varieties of hard timber. St. Joseph’s River, swift of current
and tortuous of channel, sweeps grandly past the University
grounds on the west. The scenery along its steep and and tim-
ber-lined banks is bold, wild, romantic.
Accessibility.
Notre Dame occupies a position almost central with reference
to the most important cities of the Mississippi Valley. The
railroads running directly to South Bend are the Lake Shore &
Michigan Southern, the Grand Trunk, the Vandalia, and the
Michigan Central. The road last named is connected with
South Bend by a lateral line which runs south from Niles,
Mich., and passes through the University grounds. Omni-

buses and other conveyances, by which visitors can expedi-
tiously reach Notre Dame, may be found on the arrival of trains
at the stations of the roads indicated.
Discipline.
The aim of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame is
to secure for each student that quiet and to promote that men-
tal concentration which are absolute necessities in a thorough
college course. Although the rules made and enforced with
this intention have more of a military character than is usual
in American Colleges, there is nothing required by them to
which any earnest student can reasonably object. Other than
earnest students are out of place in the University. It is sup-
posed that every student, by the mere act of matriculating, binds
himself to gentlemanly conduct while at Notre Dame. If it be
discovered that he is not worthy of a place on the list of stu-
dents, the authorities reserve to themselves the right of drop-
ping his name from that list.
The manner of life at Notre Dame is that of a large and well-
regulated family. This necessarily involves close contact on the
part of students with one another; consequently, the authorities
are obliged, in the interest of each worthy student, to enforce the
rules governing conduct with uncompromising firmness. And
yet the causes of expulsion are not more numerous than in any
well organized club of gentlemen. There can, for instance, be
no mitigation of the extremes! penalty for flagrant disobedience
of authority, the use of intoxicating liquors, immorality, the
habitual use of profane or obscene language, unauthorized
absence from the college limits, etc. In the case of suspension
or expulsion, for such offenses no tuition fees will be returned.
The students in the various college halls are under the same
rules of discipline. They retire not later than ten, and the sig-
nal for rising is given never later than 6:30. Undue attention
to athletics at the expense of studies is not permitted; while at
the same time, students are advised, expected and strongly
encouraged to take part in healthy out-door sports. Contests
with athletic organizations from the outside are, however, discour-
aged, and rarely—if ever—permitted. The athletic societies are
not permitted to take part in games outside the college premises.
16	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
A competent instructor in gymnastics is retained by the Uni-
versity. Special attention is given to the improvement of the
physical condition of the students; experience shows that the
course of study and the discipline at Notre Dame have not failed
to produce sane-minded and physically healthy men. The mili-
tary drill is optional, but it is strongly recommended to promote
manly deportment and erect carriage.
While persons of all religions denominations are admitted to par-
ticipate in the privileges of the University, it is nevertheless a strictly
Catholic institution, and all students are required to attend divine
services at stated times.
Other regulations, which time has sanctioned as salutary, may
be summarized as follsws:
i. Students are required to report at the college immedi-
ately after their arrival at the station. This rule is binding
not only at the beginning of the school year, but at all other
times when leave of absence has been granted. Unnecessary
delay in the neighboring city is looked upon as a serious viola-
tion of rule. 2. No student shall leave the University grounds
without permission of the President or Vice-President, or the
person delegated to represent them. 3. No branch of study
shall be taken up or discontinued without permission of the
Director of Studies. 4. The use of tobacco is strictly forbid-
den, except to such students of Brownson or Sorin Hall as have
received from their parents written permission to use it. 5. The
use of intoxicating liquors is absolutely prohibited under all
circumstances. 6. To guard against clandestine and improper
correspondence, the President reserves the right to supervise
letters to and from students.
GENERAL REMARKS.
A University course in education implies that the student has
had the benefit of elevating associations, as well as of careful
instruction. The desire of the authorities is to surround the
student with professors and companions of the highest charac-
ter, and their aim is to include no pupil on the list of the Uni-
versity who would not be received into the home of the most

scrupulous Christian parent. The University is a town in itself,
and the student runs no risk of suffering from the dissipations
of outside society. The environment, natural, artistic, human,
is of the most elevating character. He must work, for there are
no distractions permitted while he is at work; the system of dis-
cipline is the result of deep consideration of the best means of
developing conscientiousness, firmness of purpose, habits of
patience and self-reliance,—in a word of giving the student the
best tools for the acquiring of the highest success in life.
Members of the Junior and Senior classes of any of the Col-
legiate Courses have rooms in Sorin Hall; other students are
assigned according to age to Brownson, Carroll or St. Edward’s
Hall. Young men of 17 and upward are assigned to Brownson
Hall. Their dormitories, study hall, refectory, lavatories, etc.,
are in the east half of the main University building. The stu-
dents of Carroll Hall, whose ages range from 13 to 17, occupy
the west portion of it. The pupils of St. Edward’s Hall have a
building exclusively to themselves. The different Halls to which
students are thus assigned are entirely separate from one another.
Their inmates are seldom brought together except in certain col-
legiate classes. The pupils of St. Edward’s Hall have no direct
intercourse with the students of the other departments.
There are ample accommodations for six hundred resident
students at the University. The ventilation is exceptionally
good. Scrupulous cleanliness prevails everywhere. The fare
is abundant in quantity, varied in quality, and always whole-
some. The class-rooms are large and well lighted, as are also
the rooms used by the literary, debating, dramatic and other
societies.
The societies devoted more particularly to the cultivation of
music and the drama have always been very popular, and many
of their members have reached a higher degree of proficiency
than mere amateurs are commonly expected to attain. This is
largely due to the fact that they are aided and stimulated by the
sedulous co-operation and encouragement of professors well
qualified to give instruction in music and the drama. Then,
too, there are societies specially intended to promote the inter-
ests of religion and lead to a thorough knowledge of Christian
18
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
doctrine. By means of essays and debates great readiness in
speaking, as well as felicity in the expression of thought, is
attained by many members of these societies.
The students of the different departments are under the super-
vision of their respective prefects and professors; and while
they enjoy all the freedom compatible with the requirements of
good order, they are firmly held to an observance of the cour-
tesies expected of gentlemen in their intercourse with one another.
But there is very little occasion for the exercise of rigor in this
respect, as the students come almost invariably from homes in
which they have been brought up under the salutary influence of
careful and proper training. They have been taught to observe
the manners that distinguish upright and honorable young men;
and it is an important aim of the discipline in force at Notre
Dame to make them in all respects thorough, accomplished and
carefully educated gentlemen—gentlemen whose lives will be
useful and honorable, and tend to reflect credit upon their
parents, themselves and the University.

ENGLISH GOURSE.
It is unnecessary to state the reasons why careful training in
the art of using the English language, both in speaking and writ-
ing, is absolutely necessary. No man ignorant of the literary
masterpieces of his own language, or unable to use it with cor-
rectness, force and grace, is liberally educated; he is, in fact,
unfit for the practical duties of any important business or pro-
fession. The Faculty of the University have spared no pains to
make the Special English Course as thorough as possible.
The course extends over a period of four years, and those who
have completed the prescribed studies and passed the examina-
tions satisfactorily receive the degree of Bachelor of Letters.
A high standard is kept up throughout the course in all Eng-
lish branches, and the degree is conferred on no one who, besides
giving evidence of proficiency in the Classics and Science, has
not also, given proof of ability to supply the principles of com-
position and shown an acquaintance with the writings of the best
authors in English and American literature.
The appended scheme of the course explains itself; it is only
necessary to emphasize the following points:
[1]	From the, beginning of the course to the end special attention will be paid
to paragraphing, editorial and essay writing. Each theme will be read
and criticised in the author’s presence.
[2]	Facilities are afforded for a training in journalism by the publication,
weekly, of the Notre Dame Scholastic, a twenty-four page paper devoted
to the interests of the students, the columns of which are open to their
contributions. Every student of the course is expected, after the expira-
tion of the first year, to contribute to the Scholastic at least two articles
per session.
[3]	A familiarity is required with the masterpieces of the leading English and
American authors, and students will be encouraged to read the works of
such authors during their leisure hours. They have access at all times
to a library containing a complete collection of all the English Classics.
[4	[ A Graduation Thesis will be required of every student; this must show,
besides grace of style, a scholarly treatment of the theme selected.
The preparatory studies for this course are the same as those
introductory to the Classical Course, with the exception that
Greek may be replaced by one of the Modern Languages.
The Faculty have determined to spare no pains to render this
course of the utmost value and interest to the students, and to
32	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
encourage them to acquire a thorough familiarity with their
native language, and a facility in speaking and in composition,
which is everywhere recognized as an indispensible requisite for
success in any profession in which they may be engaged in after
life.

The English and Mathematics of the Preparatory Department
are requisite for admission into this Course. Instead of Greek
and Latin, however, French and German should be studied.
Students are advised to devote special attention to French, in
view of the valuable contributions to engineering science which
so frequently appear in French periodicals and contemporary
literature.
This course is designed to furnish the student not only a thor-
ough theoretical knowledge of the various branches of engin-
eering, but at the same time to illustrate so fully by practical
work the subjects theoretically treated as to enable the graduate
to enter at once intelligently upon the duties of his profession.
Instruction is given throughout the course by means of text
books and lectures. Considerable attention is given to the solu-
tion of problems specially prepared for the purpose of exempli-
fying the principles studied and of fixing them firmly in the
mind of the student.
The school is fully equipped with all the instruments neces-
sar}r for effective work in the different branches of field engin-
eering, Among these instruments may be mentioned engineers’
transits, plane table, Wye level, rods, tapes, chains, etc.
During the winter months, problems relating to railroad loca-
tion, computation of earthwork, etc., are carefully examined.
During the spring months students handle and adjust the instru-
ments in the field, locate a short railroad—having first made the
necessary reconnoissance and preliminary surveys—make pro-
files, plans, and topographical charts, do cross-section leveling
and make the necessary estimates for the construction of the
road.
The special studies in the Engineering Course are bridge-
building, in which the various methods of computing strains are
carefully examined, masonry construction, the strength and
resistance of materials, the theory of structure, hydraulics, land
surveying, grading, topography of land and streets, etc.
CIVIL ENGINEERING.

Students who have completed this course, after satisfactory
examination and on presentation of a thesis approved by the
Faculty, receive the degree of Civil Engineer.
The studies of the Freshman and Sophomore years of the
Course are the same as those of the corresponding years of the
Scientific Course. Elementary Physics and Chemistry should,
however, be taken during the Sophomore year in the place of
English History.-
The studies of the last two years of the Course are as follows:

BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE.
49
Goursc in Biological SGionoB.
This Course leads to the Degree of Bachelor of Science in
Biology. The University has provided this special course for
students who desire to devote their time largely to biological
pursuits, either as an immediate preparation for the study of
medicine or veterinary science, or with a view to teaching, or
otherwise engaging in biological research.
The requirements for admission to this Course are the same
as those for admission to the Freshman class of the Scien-
tific Course. An elementary knowledge of the various branches
of Natural History is also desirable.
From the programme of studies laid down it may be seen
that during the first two years the student is required to devote
his time to acquiring a knowledge of the elements of biol-
ogical science and of the physical sciences, which is absolutely
essential to the successful prosecution of an extended course of
this nature.
History and the Languages also receive attention; as does
Drawing, without which no one can be successful at present
in the field of science.
During the last two years the student is led deeper into the
study of both the organic and inorganic worlds, and at the same
time is required to apply his knowledge. During these two
years the student is urged not merely to repeat the exper-
iments in Biology made by others, but every facility and
encouragement is given him to devote himself to original
investigations.
Cytology, or Cellular Biology, both normal and pathological,
is an attractive feature of this Course, and one which undoubt-
edly will be a great help to the student to form a correct and
intelligible idea of the phenomena of life as exhibited by living
forms both unicellular and multicellular.
The study of Pharmaceutical Botany will receive special
attention, also Clay Modeling, a knowledge of which is of great
benefit to the practitioner.
50
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Some time is also devoted to Mineralogy and Geology, as no
educated man can afford nowadays to be without a knowledge
of these interesting subjects.
It is hardly necessary to add that a great part of the
time throughout the Course is spent by the students in the
various laboratories; and, moreover, private laboratories in
Biology are set aside for the more advanced students, where
they can pursue their investigations with greater facilities.

Gommerclal Course
This course can be completed in two years. It includes arith-
metic, grammar, letter-writing, geography, United States history,
reading, orthograph}7, penmanship, book-keeping, Commercial
Law—in other words all the branches of a complete business
education.
When the character and needs of the country—especially of the
great West in which we live—are considered, this course will
appear the most practical, and one of the most important that
an educational institution can afford.
Those, therefore, who have not the time or means to take a
complete College course, in the Classics and Sciences, would
do well to enroll themselves in the Commercial Course. No
plan of study is more injudicious than a hap-hazard selection of
such studies as an inexperienced young man may fancy. The
training resulting from a fixed course of studies is of the utmost
benefit to the student.
The commercial course at Notre Dame has always received
the most careful attention from the officers and the Commercial
Faculty of the University. Notre Dame claims to give the
graduates of this course a more complete business training than
can be obtained in any purely commercial college. Believing
that a business education includes something more than a mere
knowledge of Book-keeping, and that a good education cannot
be had in a few weeks, the authorities have extended this course
over two years—the shortest time in which studies necessarily
used in business life can be mastered. Should a pupil desire
during this period to pursue any other studies in which he may
be interested, and for which he has time, he will have liberty to
do so. General Histor}7 and Linear Drawing are especially
recommended to commercial students. They also have the
opportunity of attending an elementary course of the Physical
and Natural Sciences. Many commercial students find it also
to their advantage to take up the study of German or French,
for which there are the amplest facilities. A talented and stu-
dious young man may thus in the course of two years find him-
self in the possession of a most valuable practical education,
which will fit him to take his place in the front rank of educated
business men.

The Department of Physical ami Natural Sciences.
Notre Dame has always given special attention to the cultiva-
tion of the Physical and Natural Sciences, but during the past
few years extra efforts have been made in this direction, with a
view of affording to her students all the facilities and advantages
that may be found in the best equipped scientific schools. A
large and commodious building, in the Romanesque style, known
as “Science Hall,” has been erected for this purpose, and it is
the intention of the authorities to make it as perfect in all its
appointments as any similar institution in the country. It is
one hundred and thirty-one feet long by one hundred and four
feet deep, and proportionally high. There are upwards of
twenty-five spacious, well lighted and well ventilated rooms in
the building, nearly all or which are designed either as lecture
rooms or laboratories for the various branches of experimental
science.
The building has been carefully planned for the purposes to
which it is appropriated, and embodies in its construction all
the improvements and conveniences to be found in the most
approved scientific structures of this country and Europe.
Special efforts have been made to render the building conven-
ient both for the professor and student.
The laboratories, lecture-rooms, and cabinets are so connected
with one another, and with the grand apartments set aside for
the museum, that specimens and apparatus are always at hand
when desired, and where they can be used. The students of
Natural History have their specimens systematically arranged
in rooms adjoining their laboratories, whilst the students of
Chemistry and Physics have their cabinets conveniently near,
and, at the same time, independent of each other, owing to the
peculiar plan of the building. The various classes can enter
the rooms and laboratories without interfering in any way with
one another, and can continue their studies and experiments
6o
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
without interruption. The general principles of science are
taught by lectures, and these are supplemented by practical
work in the various laboratories.
In Chemistry and Physics the necessary apparatus is at the
disposal of the student, and he is expected to verify, by obser-
vation and experiment, what has not been experimentally illus-
trated in the lectures he has attended.
In all these departments, as well as in those of Physics and
Chemistry, special stress will be laid on practical work, and a
student’s proficiency will be estimated by his record of observa-
tion and experiment in the laboratory and workshop.
In the study of Botany, Zoology, and Physiology, each stu-
dent is provided with a microscope and the necessary accesso-
ries, and most of his time is spent in microscopic study, under
the direction of the Professor.
In Geology and Mineralogy the system is the same. The
student commences work in the laboratory at once, and thus
early becomes acquainted with the various minerals, rocks,
fossils, etc. The blowpipe, microscope, polariscope and cli-
nometer are in constant use to verify what has been learned in
the lecture room, and to fix it on the memory.
In the Department of Mechanical Engineering there are fully
equipped workshops, for wood and metals. Steam engines and
dynamo-electric generators, and motors of various types and
sizes furnish the power required, and afford the student special
facilities in making experiments concerning the various forms of
energy.
A Photographic Laboratory is also fitted up in the building,
where the student is enabled to learn, practically and in a short
time, the art of modern Photography, and thus prepare himself
for professional work in the studio.
Rooms have likewise been set aside for Assaying and Metal-
lurgy, and it is the purpose of those in charge to leave nothing
undone to make the work in this department compare favorably
with that accomplished in the others.
Additions of apparatus, specimens, and books for reference
are constantly being made to the various departments, and no

effort will be spared to make “Science Hall” a recognized
centre of thorough, work in genuine practical science.
Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre
Dame to promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of
which is so necessary for business or scientific purposes.
The German language—the classes of which are so numer-
ously attended—has been taught by six instructors during the
past scholastic year. The number of students attending the
German classes is becoming greater every year. The study of
French is recommended to all students of the Collegiate Courses.
The Course of Spanish will receive special attention in the
future, and other modern languages may be taught when
required.
Telegraphy and Type-Writing’.
Telegraphy invites the special attention of the students of the
commercial and scientific courses; and a knowledge of Type-
writing, which can be acquired in a short time, is useful and
valuable for all.
For the Telegraphic Department a special room is provided
and equipped with standard line instruments, including a com-
plete Wheatstone bridge set for electrical measurement. In-
struction is given by an experienced, practical operator. Each
student receives individual attention and is urged to make as
rapid progress as his ability allows. The text-book used is
Superintendent Abernethy’s “Commercial and Railway Teleg-
raphy.”
In "the Type-writing Department the machines in use are new
Remingtons, with the latest improvements. Thorough instruc-
ion is given in the manipulation and care of the machine, in
the correct forms of business letters, law work, essays and
general writing.
Phonography, or Short-hand,
is of very great assistance to those in the higher classes, enabling
its possessor to take verbatim notes of lectures, etc. It is
adaptable to the English, French, German or Spanish lan-
62
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
guages. With a good English education it is a profession in
itself, and one not likely to be over-crowded for years to come.
First-class phonographers and typewriters are always sure of
employment, and pupils in both branches here find ever}r facility
to fit them for the highest grades of pratical work.
Phonography and Type-writing have of late come into general '
use in legal and commercial work—in the court, the law office,
and the counting-room, in business houses, banks, insurance
and railroad offices, etc.,—and, for first-class stenographers
especially, the demand exceeds the supply. A knowledge of
these useful arts will therefore prove a strong recommendation
for confidential and lucrative positions.	'
Elocution.
No educational institution in the country surpasses Notre
Dame in the facilities afforded to students for acquiring profi-
ciency in elocution. The instruction is thorough, the exercises
are practical, and the subjects of study exhibit judicious variety.
These exercises are held in St. Cecilia Flail, which is peculiarly
adapted for the purpose; being conveniently situated, large, and
elegantly furnished. The exercises constitute an important part
in the studies of young men who strive to cultivate, with suc-
cess, literature, oratory, and the dramatic art. The approved
methods of stimulating and developing the natural elocutionary
powers are called into requisition as occasion seems to warrant.
To this end the drama receives a due share of attention; from
time to time an appropriate tragedjr or comedy is rendered by
students, on the.stage of Music Hall, with all' the customary
accessories and appointments used in connection with perform-
ances. Four public exhibitions are given during the year, and
public literary exercises are held seven times during the same
period. An oratorical contest is one of the notable features
marking the close of the year. For the purpose of encouraging
and stimulating students to put forth their best efforts, premi-
ums and gold medals are offered to those who most distinguish
themselves. When all these things are duly considered, there
need be no hesitation in repeating that “no educational institu-
tion in the country surpasses Notre Dame in the facilities offered
to students for acquiring proficiency in elocution.”

Drawing and Painting.
The University, which is becoming every year more widely
and favorably known as an art center, enjoys ample facilities for
imparting instruction in these branches. It possesses a large
number of models, a fine studio, and able and zealous teachers.
Music.
This department is complete in all its appointments. It has
able Professors and is divided into classes on the regular Con-
servatory system. An Orchestra of fifteen pieces, an excellent
Quartette, and a Brass Band of twenty-three instruments, are
some of the leading features of the Instrumental Music
Department.
Vocal Music, to which special attention has been paid, and
which has contributed so much to the pleasure of the students
during the past few years, will receive even more careful atten-
tion in future, and it is hoped that this branch will become every
year more popular.
Reading-Rooms.
The lower floor of Music Hall is divided into large and neatly
furnished Reading Rooms, for the benefit of the students of
Brownson and Carroll Halls. These reading rooms are sup-
plied with books and periodicals from the library, and students
have access to them during the hours of recreation.
The Lemonnier Library
continues to receive contributions from liberal friends, and now
numbers over 35,000 volumes. A reading room has been opened
in connection with the library, in which the leading periodicals
of Europe and America are to be found on file. The members
of the Library Association desire to give their Alma Mater a
collection of books which can stand comparison with those pos-
sessed by any other educational establishment in the United
States; therefore they call on the friends of the University to
assist them by donations of books, pamphlets, periodicals, and
manuscripts. All contributions should be addressed to the
Librarian of the Lemonnier Library, Notre Dame University,
Notre Dame, Ind.

Minim Department;.
For the care and training of boys under the age of thirteen
there has been established a Department to which the most
scrupulous attention has always been paid by the College author-
ities; it is known as the Minim Department, and it has always
been one of the greatest objects of interest to the Faculty as
well as to all persons visiting Notre Dame.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all the elementary
branches of an English education is here imparted, together
with a rudimentary knowledge of Latin, French, and German.
Vocal Music and Drawing form no extra charge. The pupils
of this department are taught by Sisters of the Holy Cross,
under whose maternal care they pass nearly the entire day.
Discipline.
The following is the order of the day: Rising at half-past six,
toilet, etc.; seven, breakfast, after which there is a short time
given for exercise on the Campus; half-past seven, study;
half-past nine, recreation and lunch; ten, study; a quarter to
twelve, toilet; twelve, dinner, followed by recreation; half-past
one, study; half-past three, recreation and lunch; half-past six,
supper and recreation; half-past eight, retiring. From this it
may be seen that while the Minims devote never less than six
hours a day to study, they are never more than two hours in
succession in the class room. The recreation and exercise in
the fresh air, between each two hours of study, unbend the
mind and prepare the boys to return to their classes refreshed
and ready for work.
The Minims are always under supervision, during the hours
of recreation, as well as in the class-room and study hall. The
presence, however, of the Prefects is far from being a restraint
on the amusement of the boys; for while it is the duty of the
Prefects to insist that their young charges shall always keep
within the limits of the strictest propriety, they, at the same
time, take part in all sports, organize games, and do everything

in their power to foster a love for healthful exercise. The play
grounds consist of a fine, level, five-acre field, well supplied with
turning poles, swings, ladders, rings, parallel-bars, and all other
necessary gymnastic apparatus. That the boys make good use
of them can best be seen from their healthy, happy appearances,
which invariably attracts the notice of visitors.
Connected with the play ground is a brick play-hall, 160
feet long, heated by steam. There the boys play in rainy or cold
weather.
The Sisters preside at the toilet; they clean and mend the
clothing; see to all the needs and to the comfort and conven-
ience of the Minims. Baths are taken every Saturday. Under-
clothing is changed regularly twice a week. Great care is taken
that the boys be neatly dressed, and that the clothing be suitable
for the season.
Societies.
There are two societies in the Minim Department; that of the
Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its object to
supply servers for the Church offices; and the Sorin Association,
which has been established with a view to give the pupils a start,
as early as possible, in Elocution. The Society is presided over
by one of the Professors, who finds it a pleasant duty to draw
out the talent of these interesting young orators. Meetings are
held once a week, after school hours. These meetings are a
source of pleasure as well as of profit. The members prepare
original compositions, deliver declamations, are trained to debate,
etc. Only the best behaved and more advanced in studies are
admitted to membership. To encourage this young Literary
Society a Gold Medal is annually awarded at Commencement
for Elocution to the most deserving member.
General Remarks.
The discipline to which the Minims are subjected is much
milder than that which is suited to students more advanced in
age. Recourse is scarcely ever had to punishment. Those in
charge endeavor to govern by kindness and gentleness, and by
appealing to the boys’ sense of honor. The names of all whose
conduct and application to studies are satisfactory appear under

the heads of Roll of Honor and Class Honors in the Scholastic,
a paper published weekly at Notre Dame. To find his name
mentioned in these rolls is found to be as great a reward for the
deserving pupil, as its non-appearance is a punishment for the
undeserving.
Then, again, there is a Gold Medal awarded at the end of two
full years to those whose deportment has been unexceptionable
during that period. As this fact is made known to the Minim
immediately after his entrance, he generally endeavors to shape
his conduct with a view to receiving an “Honor. ” The great-
est care is taken to form their young hearts to habits of virtue,
and to inculcate the practice of refined manners. Every effort
is made to foster respect and affection for parents, to whom they
are expected to write, at least, once a week.
Not the least of the advantages enjoyed by the Minims is their
complete separation from the larger students. An elegant and
commodious building, known as St. Edward’s Hall, affording
ample accommodations for over one hundred pupils, is devoted
to their use. It is four stories in height, one hundred and fifty
feet long, and forty-five feet wide; heated by steam, supplied
throughout with the Edison incandescent electric light, and
provided with hot and cold water. The ceilings in the Study
Hall, Class Rooms, and sleeping apartments are fifteen feet
high. The windows are large and numerous, affording abund-
ant light and ventilation. The Study Hall commands a charm-
ing view from each of its eleven large windows. It is tastefully
decorated with statuary, pictures, choice plants, beautiful flower
caskets, etc. Besides the pleasure the Minims derive from
studying in this bright, cheerful hall, their habits and tastes are
cultured by coming into contact with objects so refining.
Fronting the building is a handsome park, which, with its
sparkling fountain, rare trees and flowers, adds not a little to
the beauty of St. Edward’s Hall, as well as to the happiness of
its inmates.
These remarks, which have been made to satisfy parents and
others, who frequently write for more detailed information, will
show that, while the Minims have every possible advantage to
aid them in acquiring a good, solid education, they have also a
most happy home where they enjoy the same ease and freedom
that they would enjo}^ under the care of their mothers.

Arch.confiraterm.ty of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
This pious Association is affiliated to the Archconfraternity of
the Sacred and Immaculate Heart of Mary, established in the
Church of Our Lady of Victories, in Paris. Its primary7- object
is to pray for the conversion of sinners and persons in error.
It aims at the mutual edification and personal sanctification of
all its members by regular weekly religious exercises, monthly
communions, and other religious practices. The Archconfra-
ternity is the oldest society in the University, and recruits its
members from amongst the Catholic students of Brownson and
Sorin Halls. It was canonically established at Notre Dame by
the Very Rev. Father Sorin, in 1845, and bids fair to be in the
future, as it has been in the past, for the students of Notre
Dame, a source of many blessings from the hands of their
Patroness, the Immaculate Mother of God.
Owing to the greatly increased membership the associates
were this year divided into four branches.

ject of general remark and compliment. They are taught the
maneuvers, manual of arm s, and all the ordinary evolutions in
“United States Military Tactics.” In what is technically known
as the school of the soldier and the school of the company they
are instructed by their captains, lieutenants, and non-commis-
sioned officers, while in the battalion and regimental drill they
come more immediately under the command of the colonel.
Enlistment is altogether voluntary. No student need become a
member unless he desires to do so. However, the authorities
of the University duly encourage such organizations on account
of the salutary physical exercise they afford, the respect for
wholesome discipline they tend to promote, and the manly
bearing they serve to assure and establish.

SORIN HALL.
95
SORIN HALL is a commodious building recently erected for
the use of advanced students. It is situated a short distance
southwest of the church. Facing east, it is on a line with Sci-
ence Hall, from which it is separated by an extensive green
sward and a beautiful grove. It is a three-story and basement
building, and presents a very attractive appearance. In its
construction special attention was paid to sanitary conditions,
and every apartment and hall is well lighted and ventilated.
During the day sunshine visits every room in the building. All
the recent improvements in architecture were considered and
discriminatingly introduced in constructing and completing
Sorin Hall and arranging its interior with reference to the con-
venience of the inmates. It contains a large number of rooms
for the use of students, besides several apartments intended for
other purposes. Each of the students’ rooms is supplied with
a 16-candle electric light, and is heated by steam in cold weather.
This building has its own furnace and heating apparatus and its
own dynamo or electric-light plant. All its arrangements are
suggestive of the conveniences and comforts of a home.
The basement is divided into a reading-room, where the stu-
dent finds all the late magazines, both American and foreign; a
large apartment designed for recreation purposes at suitable
times; a room for the furnace, coal, etc.; bath-rooms, and the like.
On the first floor, at either side of the main entrance, are two
suites of elegant rooms for offices and chambers. The large
apartment at the north end of the building is used as a chapel,
and here the students assemble morning and evening for prayer.
The Law Department, with its library, lecture-room, moot-court
room, etc.; is at the south end.
The second and third floors are uniform in arrangement and
similar in appearance. Here are the rooms that the students
occupy. All of them are regularly numbered and neatly fur-
nished; and there is not one of them that does not command an
extended and beautiful view. They serve as chambers for the
96
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
young men at night and study rooms during the day. Each
room has only one occupant. Thus it is sought to insure a
proper and profitable use of time by all. This same considera-
tion has led the College authorities to prohibit the inmates of
Sorin Hall from calling on one another or visiting the rooms of
others. While not at class, nor at meals, nor engaged in taking
necessary recreation upon the campus, students are supposed to
be at work in their rooms, although at suitable times they may
meet in the reading room or recreation apartment. This build-
ing is intended for earnest and well-disposed students who
desire to make the best possible use of their time; and the rules
prescribed for its inmates are practically in harmony with the
regular standard of living to which young men of that class
seek to conform. For these the rules will be found very simple
and easy of observance. For others there can be no relaxation
of them. The penalty for the violation of any of them consists
in the forfeiture by the offender of his room and the privileges
of Sorin Hall. Where the offence is gross the forfeiture is per-
manent; but where relieved by mitigating circumstances, it may
be only temporary.
The rules governing students at Sorin Hall are found liberal
enough by all who earnestly desire to work, to be manly and
honorable, to be temperate and industrious, to be pure in speech
and above reproach in conduct. But for such as do not seek to
conform to that standard in the general tenor of their lives, or do
not endeavor to square their actions in accordance with it, the
discipline will soon be found sufficiently stringent to prevent
their remaining as inmates of the building.
The advanced students referred to as entitled to quarters at
Sorin Hall comprise young men of the Senior and Junior years in
the classical, scientific or any other regular course of a university
curriculum. When a student has attained to that rank in educa-
tional proficiency, whether he has studied here or elsewhere, he
is entitled without extra charge to a room and the privileges of
Sorin Hall. There he may remain until he finishes, or as long
afterward as he wishes, should he desire to pursue post-graduate
studies. The same rule applies to students of the Junior and
Senior year, or to post-graduates, who desire to study law.

The course of study in this Department covers a period of
three years. However, where students are entitled to advanced
standing by reason of previous study, or have been actually
engaged in the practice of law, one or two years of faithful
work may enable them to complete the course. And so where
they have studied a year or two in other law schools. While it
is desirable that three years should be given to the prosecution
of legal studies before seeking admission to the bar, yet persons
who attend all the lectures and exercises of the course and dili-
gently apply themselves to the discharge of the duties devolving
upon them may finish in two years.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
The regular course comprises three years. The student in it
must be at least 17 years of age. He must have a fair general
education and be able accurately to write the English language.
A preliminary examination may be resorted to as a means of
ascertaining his educational standing. Once he has been ad-
mitted to the course he may attend at his option any of the col-
legiate classes for which he has leisure.
The other course comprises a period of two years. The
standard of qualifications for graduation is practically the same
in both courses. The shorter course is designed more particu-
larly for the accommodation of students who have reached or
passed the age of 18 years and acquired a good general educa-
tion. Students of this course must apply themselves chiefly to
the study of law. A proper performance of the duties devolving
upon them leaves but little time for other studies.
With the exception of collegiate graduates, whose general
education is presumably finished, all young men about to enter
upon the study of law should endeavor to take the three years’
course.
Knowing how comprehensive the study of law is, and how
available all branches of human knowledge may be made in its
practice, the officers of the University aim to afford law students
special advantages—all reasonable and approved facilities—in
the work of qualifying themselves for the legal profession.
Consequently students of the Law Department may, without
additional expense, enter the classes and pursue the studies of
the classical and scientific courses. They may study the natural
and physical sciences, civil and mechanical engineering, mathe-
matics, surveying, rhetoric, literature, elocution, logic, philoso-
phy, ancient and modern languages, and the like, in connection
with the law. In these classes they have the same privileges
and are subject to the same rules as the other students.
It has been demonstrated that students of the sophomore or
junior year in the classical and scientific courses may enter with
advantage upon the study of law, attending daily at least one of
the lectures. In such instances students have been able to
qualify themselves for graduation and admission to the bar in
from three to four years. In other words, they have been able

to finish the law either contemporaneously with their graduation
in the collegiate course or within a year afterward.
Students who do not intend to practice law or become candi-
dates for the degree of LL. B., but wish simply to complete
their education by adding to their acquirements a knowledge of
legal principles, may at any proper time during the year have
their names enrolled upon the list of students in the Law De-
partment. No extra expense is thereby entailed. However,
such students must be sufficiently advanced in age and educa-
tion to justify the belief that they can understand and appreci-
ate instruction in the law. The number of students of this class
is likely to increase steadily, for year by year it is becoming more
and more manifest that an education in our time is not com-
plete without a knowledge of at least the elementary principles
of the law. Many a business man has had to face financial ruin
on account of want of acquaintance with the law. Many a
person has by an inconsiderate act due to his ignorance of the
law forfeited claim to the protection of the court and the vindi-
cations of his rights. Many a person has been compelled to do
exactly the contrary of what he intended through his failure to
understand the essential elements of a contract. Many a one
has been compelled to pay heavy damages for personal injuries
caused by negligence, or failure to perform a duty, or improper
performance of it, where no liability would exist if the “law of
torts” had been known and observed. As the law is over and
around every creature from the first moment of his being until
the grave has closed upon him, it would be impossible to over-
estimate its utility and importance. Indeed, there is no study
that can at all compare with it in practical utility, in training the
mind to accuracy of observation, in strengthening the judgment
and directing it to intelligent discrimination in the whole wide
range of secular affairs. Without a knowlecge of at least the
elementary principles of the law education in our day can hardly
be pronounced complete.
The Chief Methods of Instruction
in the Law Department consist in the delivery daily of two lec-
tures, the taking of copious notes of the same by the students,
IOO
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
the subsequent reading by them of the decisions cited in the
notes, the study of the standard elementary text-books, the
analysis and recitation in substance at least of the most import-
ant leading cases, oral examinations daily and written examina-
tions weekly, the trial of actions at law and suits in equity in
the Moot-Court, debates and exercises in public speaking at
least once a week. One of the professors presides as judge of
the Moot-Court and chairman of the society meetings. The
Moot-Court is regularly organized, having the necessary officers,
such as a judge, clerk, prosecuting attorney, sheriff, bailiff, re-
porters, etc. Pleadings are filed and actions or suits begun in
as close’ accordance as possible -with the practice of the county,
State and Federal courts.
Three classes are taught daily. Two hours are devoted to the
lectures, while one hour is given to “quizzing” and recitations.
Wednesday and Saturday evenings are devoted to society and
Moot-Court proceedings. Students take full notes of the lec-
tures. These cover the whole domain of the law and state
principles pithily and intelligibly. They state what seem to be
the correct or established rules and avoid the contradictions that
perplex so many students. They are deemed highly valuable
not only in preparing for examination, but also in subsequent
practice, as the latest decisions are often found cited in them.
In the “quiz” class it is sought by question and answer to cover
the whole ground of the law. Questions bearing upon every
branch and phase of it are put to the students during the two or
three years of their course, and almost necessarily they become
familiar not only with them, but also with the proper answers.
Hence the ground is covered, ist, by the lectures; 2d, by the
study of the notes and the reading and analysis of important
decisions; 3d, by the study of the best elementary text-books,
lists of which may be had from the professor; 4th, by daily
examinations or “quizzes.” These “quizzes” are exceptionally
instructive and interesting. They are conducted orally—in
conversational style. They are not conducted with a view to
puzzling or confusing the students. On the contrary, the aim
is to make everything clear and intelligible to them. Moreover,
they are invited to ask the examiner for information upon, any
LAW DEPARTMENT.	IOI
and every topic that may seem in any way obscure to them. At
certain times adjudicated cases of special importance are analy-
zed and explained. The rise, or organization and development
of courts likewise receives due attention. The common law
and code methods of beginning an action, filing the pleadings,
joining issue, impaneling the jury, examining witnesses, applying
the rules of evidence, preparing instructions, receiving the ver-
dict, moving for a new trial, arguing the motion for it, taking
the case to the higher courts on appeal, preparing the record,
abstract and brief, and doing all things necessary in the man-
agement of a trial, are fully described and exemplified. Matters
that could not profitably be treated at length in the lectures,
with the requisite variety of illustrations and qualifications, are
taken up and considered at “quiz.” Hypothetical cases invol-
ving the principles that students find it most difficult to master
are frequently submitted, analyzed and explained. The ques-
tions and answers cover all the most important principles stated
in the notes, but the range of the “quiz” is broader in certain
directions than the notes. Nothing is overlooked which may
legitimately be made the subject of a question in the examina-
tion for admission to the bar. It is evidently due in no small
measure to this fact that the graduates of this Department have
been so exceptionally successful in their examinations. Certain
it is that no law school in the country has a more creditable
record than Notre Dame in that regard. However, the Supreme
Court of Indiana has adopted a rule providing for the admis-
sion of graduates of this Department on motion, Or without
examination. Under this rule they may present themselves
before the court and receive certificates of admission to the bar.
They are likewise admitted on motion to the bar of the Federal
courts. It is required, however, that applicants for admission
to the bar of this State shall be voters.
The Common Law
is taught primarily at Notre Dame. That is the law generally
prevalent throughout the Union. It addresses itself to almost
all the relations of life. In fact, about nineteen out of ever}7
twenty cases tried in our courts are decided in accordance with
102
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
its principles. It is generally uniform in its operation. How-
ever, the statutory enactment of State Legislatures overcome
and displace it so far as they conflict with it. These enactments
differ materially in different States, owing to unlike conditions
and local differences. Thus it is that the laws of certain States
are so radically unlike the laws of other States. Of course,
there are instances in which statutes are passed to cover acts
and conditions not provided for by the common law; but in
most instances the existing statutes qualify, displace or render
inoperative some rules of the common law. The repeal of
statutes having this effect restores the common law rules to their
former force and efficacy. In view of these facts, thorough
instruction is here given in the common law. Neither lawyers
nor judges pretend to know the statutes of any other State than
that in which they practice or preside. Moreover, no court
pretends to take judicial cognizance of or know the statutes of
any other State than that in wdiich it has its being and jurisdic-
tion. In fact a knowledge of the statutes of different States
would be more confusing and bewildering than profitable to
judge, lawyer and student. In an examination for admission to
the bar in any State in the Union no question is put and noth-
ing is said relative to the statutes of any other State. There
are, however, certain fundamental statutor}7' enactments that
exist without material diversity in their scope and purpose in
almost all the States. Again, other statutes somewhat less
important and fundamental in character exist in groups of States.
Such statutes as these may profitably be studied in class, in
connection with the common law, but it would be worse than
useless for a student to attempt to investigate and study the
mazes of statutory differences in the several States. Hence it
is recommended as advisable for each student to bring with him
when he comes here in September to pursue the study of law a
copy of the revised statutes of his own State or of the State in
which he proposes to practice.
In the Matter of Expenses
no discrimination is made between laws tudents and the students
of the regular collegiate courses. The fee for board, lodging,
LAW DEPARTMENT.
103
tuition, washing and mending of linens, etc., is fixed at $300.00
for the scholastic year. Terms of payments and other informa-
tion will be found under the head of expenses, page 19-20.
Isolated as Notre Dame is, students enjoy immunity from the
distractions and temptations of city life and need incur no note-
worthy expenses aside from those stated. They live in an
atmosphere of study, and every incentive and feeling of emula-
tion aroused in them tends to the formation of studious habits.
Thus their work is rendered peculiarly effective. It has often
been demonstrated that nowhere else do students accomplish
more work in a given time. This fact is not be overlooked in
considering the matter of expense. In order to maintain this
salutary state of things the same rules of discipline apply to all
students, whether in the Law Department or in the collegiate
courses. Access may be had at reasonable hours, not only to
the Lemonnier Library, but also to the Law Library. This
contains all the standard text-books and reports. Every decis-
ion rendered for several years in the State, Territorial and Fed-
eral courts may be found in the Law Library. Consequently
students need purchase but very few law-books. In this regard
they are specially favored, for at other law schools the item of
books alone for each student frequently amounts to from $100
to $300.
Young men eligible to begin the study of law may be matric-
ulated as students of this Department at any time during the
year. They are charged only from the date of entrance. How-
ever, it is advisable to enter at or near the beginning of the
scholastic year. Students in the graduating year are known as
Seniors. The others are called Juniors. All law students,
whether Seniors or Juniors, whose general education is suffi-
ciently advanced to place them on a footing with students in
the Senior or Junior class in the collegiate course, are entitled
to free rooms in Sorin Hall.
A Post-Graduate Course
for law students has recently been established. Graduates may-
return at any time and enter upon the studies of this course.
By devoting a year to the work prescribed and passing the. ex-
104
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
amination they become entitled to the degree of Master of Laws.
They are entitled to rooms free of charge and have all the rights
an d’privileges of other post-graduates. The course of instruc-
tion consists mainly in the analytical study and writing of plead-
ings, the examination of witnesses, the taking of depositions,
the trial of actions at law and suits in equity, the practical
application of rules of evidence, the preparation of briefs and
arguments for the higher courts, the study of leading cases,
practice from time to time in what is popularly called “office
wrork,” daily participation in the exercises of the “quiz class, ”
a comparative study of the legislation of different countries, and
the influence of the civil law upon the development of modern
jurisprudence. It is believed that the student who finishes this
course and reads carefully the revised statutes of his State will
be qualified to enter at once upon the practice of law.
Everjr student who is a candidate for the degree of Bachelor
of Laws or Master of Laws is required to write, at least six
weeks before graduation.
A Thesis
upon some legal topic selected by himself. It should not be
less than 40 folios in length. The wrriter is expected to read the
thesis at a special meeting of the class and to defend the propo-
sitions set forth in it. Having read and defended it success-
fully, he places it in the hands of the Dean of the Faculty,
wThose approval it must have. If it be not meritorious in matter,
form and style, the student may forfeit the right to be considered
a candidate for graduation until the following year and the
submission by him of a satisfactory thesis.
In Conclusion
it may be stated that nowhere can the study of law be more
profitably pursued than at Notre Dame. The diligent student
may here qualify himself to pass the most rigid examination in
any State. He may lay broad and deep the foundation of
his legal knowledge and fit himself to become notable in the
profession and worthy of it honors.
Students here have a decided advantage over those of some
other law schools, in that they are not so numerous as to make
LAW DEPARTMENT.	105
the Law Class unwieldly and cumbersome. It is hardly noticed
in some places "who does and who does not attend class, and the
relative standing of students is often quite unknown to the
professors. So numerous are they that the books of even a vast
library would be inadequate for their use. A score of them may
desire to refer to and read the same book at the same time.
Taking moot-court cases in turn, they can hardly try before the
professors more than one or two in the year. They may not be
required to answer each on an average more than one question
a week. They receive little or no practical instruction. Left
almost wholly to themselves in the choice of methods of study,
it is not remarkable that there should be an absence of system
in the work they do, nor is it singular that many of them utterly
fail to make substantial progress. Such evils almost inevitably
attend the work of instructing a very large class. Moreover a
large corps of professors would be requisite in such case. And
who does not know that the larger the corps of professors, the
more difficult for them to act in unison, to avoid repetition, to
cover the law in its entirety, to understand readily and work
effectively to overcome the peculiar weaknesses and drawbacks
of each student?
Law students at Notre Dame have none of these evils to
contend against. Here each member of the class come fre-
quently in contact with the professors and becomes known to
them. He is directed and aided in his work. He is required
to attend class regularly and to obey in his deportment and the
discharge of his duties certain prescribed rules of discipline—
rules of discipline deemed necessary for his welfare. Thus he
may be strengthened at ever}^ weak point. Thus he may be
rounded out into symmetrical and useful manhood. Thus may
his character be formed in the mold of honor and impressed
with the noble traits and admirable qualities of gentleman,
scholar and lawyer.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
InstltuiB of ToGhnoioflii
This building has been erected on the most approved plans,
after a study of the best institutions of the kind at home and
abroad. In size it is 109 feet long by 40 feet wide and three
stories high. Convenience, ventilation, and an abundance of
light are provided for in all the rooms.
The Institute is divided into three principal departments: that
of Theoretical and Experimental Engineering, the department
of Practical Mechanics, ond the department of Machine Drawing
and Design.
1.—Engineering Department.
This department is divided into two principal sections; that
of the class-room or Theoretical Engineering, and that of
the Mechanical Laboratory or Experimental Engineering.
(T) Section of Theoretical Engineering.—The course of
studies in the class-room during the Junior year comorises the
subjects of Materials of Construction, Kinematics or Mechanical
Movements, and the Principles of Machine Design.
These principles are illustrated by models in the lecture-room
and further explained in the drawing-room.
The Senior year is devoted to the study, by text-book and
lecture, of Thermodynamics, the Theory of the Steam Engine
and other motors, the construction and operation of boilers
and pumps. A graduating thesis and drawing, and a specimen
of shopwork are required of each candidate for a degree at the
close of the year.
(2) Section of Experimental Engineering.—This depart-
ment is devoted to calorimetry and the standardization of instru-
ments; the adjusting and operation of prime movers, boilers and
pumps, with precise measurements of their power and efficiency;
the testing of the strength and properties of the materials of
construction, the metals, woods, oils, etc. The purpose of this
course is not only to familiarize the student with the apparatus
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.	IO/
employed but to teach him some of the methods of research
and prepare him for the prosecution of original investigations.
H.—Department of Practical Mechanics.
This department is divided into two sections: "Wood-work-
ing and Machine-shop Work.
(1)	Section of Wood-working.—This section comprises three
courses: 1st, the course in Joinery, in which the student is
taught the use and care of hand tools, the making of joints and
parts of structures, and the best methods of laying off and
executing the most familiar operations of the joiner and
carpenter; 2d, the course of Wood-Turning, in which he learns
the use of the lathe and acquires a fair degree of skill in working
to measurement; 3d, the course of Pattern Making, which is a
combination of the other two for mechanical purposes. The
machine tools used in this course, besides the lathes, are the
scroll saw, the planer, the saw bench, and universal trimmer.
(2)	Section of Machine-Shop Work.—The exercises of this
course are graded and principally designed to illustrate the use
of the tools. The tools employed are the lathe, planer and
shaper, drill-press, milling-machine, grinding apparatus, etc.,
such as are most commonly met in general practice.
III.—Department of Machine Drawing and Design.
Instruction in this course begins with free-hand sketching of
the parts of machines some of which may afterwards be made to
scale. Linear drawing and the use of instruments follow; and
the principles of descriptive geometry are taught until the
student can work with certainty and precision. Students in
the courses of kinematics and machine design study on the
drawing-board more fully the details of mechanisms and the
relations of connected parts. This is done under the direction
of the instructors of those branches, who also assist in thesis
work and the designing of complete machines. Tracing, blue-
printing, coloring, and the conventionalities of drawing are
practiced extensively.
Special Courses.
Those who do not take the course of Engineering may, if
recommended by the Director of Studies, enter the shops for

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
a course immanual training or for the purpose of acquiring skill
in practical mechanics.
Course in Applied Electricity.
A practical and experimental course in applied Electricity has
been arranged for students in Electrical Engineering.
Other students, having available time and proper attainments,
who desire practical knowledge of the modern applications of
Electricity may enter this class.
The laboratory exercises wull be similiar to those contained in
Ayrton’s Practical Electricity, Slingo and Brooker’s Electrical
Engineering, Kempe’s Electrical Testing and Thompson’s
Dynamo-Electric Machinery. Recitations and careful notes of
all work performed will be required.
The equipment and conveniences provided for this course are
very complete and well-selected. Four rooms having a floor
space of over 2,000 square feet in the basement of Science Hall
are used for a testing laboratory, a construction and experi-
mental w’ork-shop, a battery and photometer room and a
dynamo and engine room. These are an addition and auxiliary
to the cabinets, laboratories and lecture-room of the general
physics department. The appliances comprise numerous forms
of batteries, direct and alternate current dynamos and motors,
arc and incandescent lighting apparatus, and a large collection
of the latest types of American and foreign scientific and
commercial instruments for current strength, E. M. F., resist-
ance, insulation, capacity, efficiency and photometer tests and
measurements. The University of Notre Dame was one of the
first in the United States to be lighted by electricity. The
plant consists of three Edison dynamos for indoor lighting and
a Thomson-Houston arc light dynamo for illuminating the
grounds. In the eight buildings where the incandescent light
has been introduced there are over five miles of wiring. This
affords opportunity for practical inspection and testing.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC.
121
the "Notre Dame Scholastic”
Is the title of a neat 24-page paper, devoted to the interests of
the students, and is published at the University every week
during Term time. This journal opens a field for young writers
who might otherwise, for want of a proper medium, allow their
talents to remain inactive.
The Scholastic contains articles of an instructive literary
character, interesting Biographical sketches, Essays, Poetry,
Notes on Art, Music, Science and Literature, Notes of New
Publications, etc., etc.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic has a
special importance for students, their parents, and all who have
attended classes at the University in times past, on account of
the weekly summary of events transpiring at Notre Dame, per-
sonal notices of former students, Rolls of Honor, Class Hon-
ors, List of Excellence, etc., which appear in its columns every
week. Reports relative to the arrangement of classes, the pro-
motion of the more talented and energetic students, etc., also
find a place in this paper, and keep parents and others informed
on all that concerns their children and friends.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the coming
year to merit the encouragement given the paper in the past,
.and the encomiums bestowed upon it by the press in general.
