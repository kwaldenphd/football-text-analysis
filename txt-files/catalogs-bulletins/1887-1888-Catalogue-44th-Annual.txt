N 1842 the Very Rew E. Sorin, now Superior-General of the
.. Congregation of the Holy Cross, visited this place for the
first time. Specially interested in the promotion of education,
as representative of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, a mere
glance fully satisfied him that this would be a most desirable
site for an institution of learning; and he determined to establish
here the chief house of the Congregation in the United States,
the
(
University of Notre Qarne.
In that year it was founded, and in 1844 it was chartered by
the General Assembly of Indiana. Its growth kept pace with
the rapid progress of the Northwest; it exhibited an enterprise
not unworthy of comparison with the energy and public spirit
that peopled the prairies and built the magnificent cities of the
Mississippi Valley. Building after building was erected as its
continuous progress required. The number of students gradually
increased, the standard of studies was steadily raised, and before
many years had elapsed the University attained an honorable
rank among the educational institutions of the Union.
A few years ago, however, the University was subjected to a
most severe trial. April 23, 1879, five of the buildings, including
the main one, were entirely destroyed by fire. The contents
of the museums, libraries, class-rooms, study-halls, etc., were
burned to ashes. But the energy and recuperative powers of
the institution were equal to the emergency. While the fire still
lingered among the smouldering ruins active preparation for the
new building was begun, and during May and all the summer
the gwork of constructing it was busily and uninterruptedly
prosecuted. When September came, and the students returned,
they found on the site of the old building one of the largest and
most magnificent college edifices in the country. Since then
1

; | the growth and progress of the institution have rendered
necessary the construction of a wing on either side, while several
। large and imposing buildings have been ereCted in the vicinity.
1 i All these college buildings are new, well lighted, thoroughly
J ventilated, heated by steam, and supplied with the most useful
' modern improvements. They present a striking harmony of
j color, being built of cream-colored brick. A brief description
J of the
.Main and Ancillary buildings
i :
! seems not inappropriate in this connection, and the most natural
. ‘ order of dealing with them assigns first place to the
। Main Building. This is five stories high, while its dimensions
: are 320.x 155 feet. The distance from the ground to the eleCtric
■ light just above th*e statue surmounting the dome is 200 feet.
The libraries, museums, art galleries, class-rooms, study-halls,
dormitories, lavatories, refectories, etc., are appropriately and
conveniently arranged. On the first floor are the refeCtories,
lavatories, trunk-rooms, armories, etc. The refeCtories are richly
ornamented with mural paintings, representing many of the most
i celebrated churches and buildings in the world, and beautifully
■ * illustrating the progress of architecture. The lavatories are
f supplied with hot and cold water, and have all the customary
accommodations. The armories contain about 150 stand of
| arms, with bayonets, accoutrements, etc. These arms were
■I ' procured from the State, and students of the Senior and Junior
departments may make use of them, form companies, and learn
; ; to drill. The reception parlors, and offices of the President,
; . Secretaries, and PrefeCt of Discipline are on the main floor, as
' t are also the study-halls, several of the class-rooms, the telegraph
• office, and the Students’ office. This floor is made of tiling,
• while the corridor is lined with a series of superb mural paintings
. (the work of the distinguished Roman artist, Signor Luigi Gregori,)
! which illustrate the leading events in the life of Columbus, or,
' more particularly, such of them as history associates with the
! discovery of America. Portraits of distinguished ecclesias-
PROSPECTUS.	13
tics, including almost all the Catholic Bishops in the
United States, those living as well as those who have gone to
their reward, line the walls of the corridors on the floor above,
and it is appropriately called “ the Bishops’ Gallery.” The
society-rooms are on the same floor, as are also some of the
class-rooms. They are tastefully ornamented with paintings
and mural decorations, not to mention the busts of several
noted personages. The Law Library and LetSture-room, a
small museum, and the rooms of several of the professors, as
well as two large dormitories, are likewise on this floor. The
Lemonnier Library is on the third floor, and there also is a
Museum of Curiosities. Two large dormitories that correspond
in size and appearance to those below, together with the rooms
of students of the graduating classes, and of some of the pro-
fessors, occupy the rest of the floor. The music-rooms of the
vocal classes and the Department of Drawing take up the greater
part of the fourth floor. The Lemonnier Library contains about
30,000 volumes, not to mention miscellaneous objects of interest
gathered from all parts of the United States and many parts of
the world. In the Law Library are about 1200 volumes, in-
cluding many of the British and American Reports and the lead-
ing text-books. From three to four wide oaken staircases afford
communication between the different floors all the way from the
first story to the top of the building; and these, supplemented
by several exits to the roofs of verandas and porticoes, with
ample means of descending • safely to the ground, remove all
danger of personal injury in case of fire. But the fullest pre-
cautions have been taken to guard against that peril. With a
watchman constantly on duty, water on each floor, and hose at
hand there is absolutely no danger of fire. The halls throughout
the building are wide, high, and spacious. The many angles
which distinguish the building were planned and constructed in
accordance with the prevailing style of architecture at Notre
Dame, which is that known as the modern Gothic. These
angles serve to give great strength and solidity to the entire
building-, rendering it secure against the fury of wind and storm,

not to mention the incidental advantages of good light and
perfect ventilation which they afford. Just east of it is the
magnificent new
Music Hall. This is 170 feet in length by 100 in width,
and over 100 in height. The first floor is divided into recreation
and reading rooms, the north end being for the Juniors and the
south for the Seniors. These rooms are supplied with news-
papers, periodicals, games of all kinds, billiard-tables, etc. The
dressing rooms of the Bicycle Club and of the Athletic Associ-
ation are also on this floor. The second and third floors at the
north end are appropriately divided into music-rooms, and
instrumental music of all kinds is there taught. The Exhibition
Hall occupies the remainder of the building. In it are given
the more formal lectures, as well as concerts and dramatic enter-
tainments. Fully furnished with the scenes, accessories and dec-
orations appropriate to such uses, and capable of accommodating
1200 persons, it ranks as one of the largest and most attractive
college halls in the country.
Science Hall. The corner-stone of this imposing edifice
was laid by the Right Rev. Bishop Watterson, of Columbus, in
1883. It is situated a few steps south of Music Flail. The
dimensions are 104 x 131 feet, and the height is three stories, or
75 feet. It is appropriately divided into two departments, and
supplied with all the agencies requisite to facilitate the acquisi-
tion of a complete knowledge of the sciences. The laboratories,
machinery department, ledture-rooms, museums, engine-rooms,
microscopic division, incandescent eleCtric light plant, etc., are
admirably arranged and elegantly finished. The Hall is fully
equipped with all necessary chemicals, preparations, specimens,
charts, tools, instruments, and the innumerable accessories of a
great school of science. It is said to be one of the largest
buildings devoted exclusively to scientific studies in the United
States, and its merits, we trust, will entitle it to rank among the
best. The Seniors’ campus, or play-ground, a level trad!
containing about ten acres, lies southeast of it. Northeast
of it is
PROSPECTUS.	15
The Gymnasium, which measures 160 feet in length and 45 in
width, and is two stories in height. It is abundantly supplied
with swings, turning-poles, horizontal bars, and other apparatus
calculated to inspire a taste for gymnastic exercises. The north
half is for the use of the Juniors, whose campus surrounds it,
while the south half is set apart for the Seniors. Just north of
the Gymnasium and Music Hall is St. Edward’s Park; and
fronting this, facing south, is the noted
O	7	O	7
St. Edward’s Hall, a building four stories high, and 100 feet*
7	o	O 7
in length, by 50 in width. This is for the exclusive use of pupils
under 13 years of age. It is entirely separate from the Univer-
sity, though under the same general management. The building
is new, and lacks none of the appointments suggested by experi-
ence as useful or desirable. It is divided into study-halls, class-
rooms, dormitories, etc. The recreation hall is just east of it,
while farther east and north lies the play-ground. The pupils are
under the immediate diredtion of competent and experienced
teachers—Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.
The Infirmary adjoins St. Edward’s Hall on the west. In
dimensions it is 100 x 45 feet, and three stories high. The
General Office occupies a portion of the first floor. The rooms
on the floor above are kept in readiness for the reception of stu-
dents who at any time become too ill to. attend class and dis-
charge their customary duties. The regular physician of the
University and the Sisters in charge minister to the sick in all cases.
The Church stands a little west and south of the main
building. It is generally regarded as one of the most symmetrical
and beautiful churches in the country. In size it is 275 x 120
feet, and the distance from the ground to the apex of the roof is
about 125 feet. It is ornamented with paintings, statuary, altar
accessories, architectural devices, etc., and hours may profitably
be given to the examination and study of these and the multitu-
dinous objects of interest and beauty in which it abounds. In its
tower is one of the largest bells on the American continent.
Besides, there are 32 smaller bells in the tower. These vary in
size and constitute the noted “ chimes of Notre Dame. ”
16	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.'
The Steam Printing Office is just north of the main
building. It contains three large power presses, a folding
machine, a mailing department, two composing rooms, and all
the accessories of a first class printing establishment. The Ave
Maria and the Scholastic, two well-known and deservedly popu-
lar weekly publications, are there printed. Between it and the
Infirmary is
The Boiler-House, from which rises the great chimney so
conspicuous in the vicinity. This building is provided with
double furnaces of the largest size—furnaces that sometimes
consume 35 tons of coal in a day. It has, too, a full supply of
engines and other machinery. On the second floor are bath-
rooms for the students. South of and connecting with it is an
annex which contains the engine and plant recently placed there
by the Edison EleCtric Light Company. It is one of the most
powerful of the kind in use, and by means of it the University is
lighted throughout with the incandescent eleCtric light. The
refectories, lavatories, study halls, class-rooms, offices, and private
rooms and apartments are all supplied with this superior illumi-
nating agency, not to mention the crown and crescent of the
great statue, which present a most striking appearance at night,
and are visible for miles, in every direCtion, like a beacon-light
upon the ocean.
A regularly established United States post-office is situated
on the University grounds, a short distance from the main
building. It is particularly intended for the accommodation of
the University and St. Mary’s Academy. But there are too
many buildings at Notre Dame to receive notice in this connec-
tion. Indeed so numerous are they that, if brought close to-
gether, they would cover at least four or five acres of ground.
Nevertheless, the work goes steadily forward and great im-
provements are made from year to year.
Surroundings.
The University is situated about a mile and a half north
of the flourishing city of South Bend, Ind., and about eight
PROSPECTUS.	17
miles south of Niles, Mich. It is surrounded by a fertile
and prosperous forming country. And yet, by reason of its
proximity to South Bend, it combines the conveniences and
accommodations of city life with the salutary isolation, whole-
some climate, and natural beauties of the country. A great
broad avenue runs diredtly south from the University for a mile
or more, and on both sides for half the distance it is lined with
.shade trees. North and west of the University lie two beauti-
ful lakes—St. Joseph’s and St. Mary’s. The area of the former
is but a little less than 23 acres, while that of the latter is about 24
acres. The ground slopes picturesquely down to these lakes,
and beautiful walks along the shores almost surround them.
On the higher ground, above the walks and overlooking the
lakes, are magnificent groves of oak, hickory, sycamore, and
other varieties of hard timber. St. Joseph River, swift of current
and tortuous of channel, sweeps grandly past the University
grounds on the west. The scenery along its steep and timber-
lined banks is bold, wild, romantic.
Accessibility.
Notre Dame occupies a position almost central with reference
to the most important cities of the Mississippi Valley. The
railroads running diredtly to South Bend are the Lake Shore
and Michigan Southern, the grand Trunk, the Vandalia Line,
and the Michigan Central. The road last named is connected
with South Bend by a lateral line which runs south from Niles,
Mich., and passes through the University grounds. Omnibuses
and other conveyances, by which visitors can expeditiously
reach Notre Dame, may be found on the arrival of trains at the
stations of the roads indicated.
(Discipline.
The regulations looking to the maintenance of discipline are
sufficiently liberal to meet the reasonable expectations of all
who try to conduct themselves as gentlemen. To these the
rules are easy of observance, and students whose deport-
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.

i
meat is not that of gentlemen must not expect to remain at
Notre Dame.
There is probably no great educational institution in the
country in which students become acquainted with one another
more intimately than at this University. They are brought, in
connection with their several duties, into daily, if not hourly,
contact. This fact serves to emphasize the importance of requir-
ing compliance with regulations calculated to render them
courteous, upright, honorable, pure in expression, respectful to
religion, and emulous to excel in their several studies.
They arc required to rise at the same time in the morning, and
meals are taken by all at the same hours during- the day. All
retire not later than 9.30 o'clock p. m., and the signal for rising
is given not later than 6.30 a.m. At proper times, too, they are
expected to take necessary out-door exercise.
While persons of all religious denominations are admitted to
participation in the privileges of the University, it is, nevertheless,
a strictly Catholic institution, and all the students are required
to attend divine service at stated times.
Other regulations, which time has sanctioned as salutary, may
be summarized as follows: 1. No branch of study shall be
discontinued without permission of the Director of Studies.
2. No student shall leave the University grounds without per-
mission of the President or Vice-President, or the persons
delegated to represent them. 3. The use of tobacco is striCtly
forbidden, except to such students of the Senior department as
receive from their parents written permission to use it. 4. The
use of intoxicating liquors is absolutely prohibited under all
circumstances. 5. Any person who injures the property of the
University must make compensation for the same. 6. To guard
against clandestine and improper correspondence, the President
reserves the right to supervise letters to and from students.
7. Books, periodicals and newspapers are subjeCt to the approval
of the Director of Studies.

Neither pains nor expense has been spared to secure the
PROSPECTUS.	19
services of able, experienced and gentlemanly professors, and the
authorities of the University have reason to believe that their
efforts in this direction have been attended with results particu-
larly gratifying. It may, too, be confidently stated that there is
no educational institution in the Union that affords students more
time for study or better opportunity to acquire a sound and
comprehensive education than Notre Dame offers. Its compar-
ative isolation insures immunity from distractions of every kind;
society throws no allurements in the way of the student to tempt
him from the performance of his duties; association with persons
of depraved tastes and bad habits is necessarily avoided; the
surroundings are favorable to study, and the student must learn,
— even the common pride of wholesome emulation compels him
to do so. Moreover, the course of life pursued under the salutary
I discipline in force can hardly fail to establish firmness of
character and habits that go to form a moral, temperate, honor-
able and conscientious man.
Students are classified according to age as Seniors, Juniors,
and Minims. The Seniors range in age from 17 years upward.
Their dormitories, study-hall, refectory, lavatories, etc., are in
the east half of the University. The Juniors, whose ages range
from 13 to 17 years, occupy the west portion of it. The Minims
have a building exclusively to themselves. The three depart-
ments to which students are thus assigned, are entirely separate
from one another. Seniors and Juniors are seldom brought
together, except in a few classes of the Collegiate Course. The
Minims have no diredt intercourse with the students of the other
departments.
There are ample accommodations for five hundred resident
students at the University. The ventilation is exceptionally good
Scrupulous cleanliness prevails everywhere. The fare is abun-
dant in quantity, varied in quality, and always wholesome. The
class-rooms are large and well lighted, as are also the rooms
used by the literary, debating, dramatic, and other societies.
The societies devoted more particularly to the cultivation of
music and the drama have always been very popular, and many
20	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
of their members have reached a higher degree of proficiency
than mere amateurs are commonly expected to attain. This is
largely due to the faCt that they are aided and stimulated by the
sedulous co-operation and encouragement of professors well
qualified to give instruction in music and the drama. Then, too,
there are societies specially intended to promote the interests of
religion and lead, to a thorough knowledge of Christian doctrine.
By means of essays and debates great readiness in speaking, as
well as felicity in the expression of thought, is attained by many
members of these societies.
The students of the different departments are under the super-
vision of their respective prefects and professors; and while they
enjoy all the freedom compatible with the requirements of good
order, they are firmly held to an observance of the courtesies and
manners recognized by gentlemen in their intercourse with one
another. But there is very little occasion for the exercise of
rigor in this respeCt, as the students come almost invariably from
homes in which they have been brought up under the salutary
influence of careful and proper training. They have been taught
to observe the manners that distinguish upright and honorable
young men, and it is an important aim of the discipline in force
at Notre Dame to habituate them to such manners, and to make
them in all respeCts thorough, accomplished and carefully edu-
cated gentlemen—gentlemen whose lives will be useful and
honorable, and tend to refledt credit upon their parents, them-
selves and the University.

A CHANGE is coming over American Colleges with respect
to the teaching of English. Till a very recent period the
higher branches of Rhetoric and Literary Criticism did not receive
all the attention they deserved. The last decade has witnessed
a marked improvement in this point, and the importance of the
IS
now recognized in all the great
educational institutions of this country and of Europe. It has been
remarked by a great authority that, “ when once the English
language and English and American Literature become recognized
as a regular educational course, the advantages will be so great as
to constitute nothing short of a national benefit.”
The Faculty of the University of Notre Dame, recognizing the
fact that the exclusive study of the ancient languages and of pure
science is not in itself sufficient for a liberal education, have deter-
mined to institute a course which shall provide for a more than
ordinarily thorough acqaintance with the English language and
with English and American literature. At the same time, all that
is most serviceable in the Classical and Scientific courses will be
made an indispensable requisite.
The course will extend over a period of four years, and those
who have completed the prescribed studies and passed the examin-
ations satisfactorily will receive the degree of Bachelor of Letters.
A high standard will be kept up throughout the course in all
English branches, and the degree will be conferred on no one
who, besides giving evidence of proficiency in the Classics and
Science, has not also given proof of ability to apply the principles
of composition and shown an acqaintance with the writings of the
best authors in English and American literature.


i
ENGLISH COURSE.	43
The appended scheme of the course explains itself ; it is only [
necessary to emphasize the following points :
(1)	From the beginning of the course to the end special attention will be paid to '
Essay writing, and each essay will be read and criticised in its
author’s presence.
(2)	Facilities are afforded for a training in journalism by the publication, :
„ weekly, of the Notre Dame Scholastic, a twenty-four page paper devoted
to the interests of the students, the columns of which are open to their ’
contributions. Every student of 1 he course will be expected, after the
expiration of the first year, to contribute to the Scholastic at least tw o
articles per session.
(3)	A familiarity will be required with the masterpieces of the leading English
and American authors, and students will be encouraged to peruse the
works of such authors during their leisure hours by having access at
all times to a library containing a complete collection of all the English
Classics.
(4)	A Graduation Thesis will be required of every student; this must show, ■
besides grace of style, a scholarly treatment of the theme selected. The
choice of themes will be left to the graduates, subject to the approval of
the Faculty.
The preparatory studies for this course are the same as those
introductory to the Classical Course, with the exception that Latin
or Greek may be replaced by one of the Modern Languages.
The Faculty have determined to spare no pains to render this
course of the utmost value and interest to the students, and to
encourage them to acquire a thorough familiarity with their native
language, and a facility in speaking and in composition, which is
everywhere recognized as an indispensable requisite for success in
any profession in which they may be engaged in after life.
The programme of studies is as follows :

II.—LAW COURSE.
VTUMEROUS changes have recently been macle in this Depart-
1N ment. The regular course has been extended to a period of
three years ; the standard of studies has been raised to the most
approved plane, and the Lecture system has been substituted for I
the compulsory use of text-books. It may now be confidently |
claimed that no Law School in the country offers superior facilities >
for acquiring a thorough and practical knowledge of the Law. '
Students of the Law Department pass through a course that
qualifies them to undergo the most searching examination for
admission to the Bar in any part of the Union. No special prep-
aration is requisite for matriculation. Any person 17 years of age,
or upward, and having a fair English education, is eligible. Young
men may enter the Department as students at any time during the
year ; though, of course, it is more desirable to do so at the
beginning of the session,
o	o
The diploma admits, without examination, to the Bar of the
State and Federal courts, subject to the Constitutional requirement
that applicants for admission shall be voters.
Methods of Instruction.
Instruction is given by means of daily Lectures, with accom-
panying examinations, and the trial from week to week of Moot-
Court cases. The order of procedure in these cases corresponds as
closely as practicable to that followed in the trial of actions and
suits in the regular courts of law and equity. The Lectures embrace
and fully cover the various subjects of Contracts, Torts, Statutory
Enactments and Construction, International, Constitutional, Com-
mercial, Maritime, and Criminal Law, as well as Medical Jurispru-
dence, Common Law and Equity Pleadings and Practice, Code
Pleadings and Practice, Evidence, etc.
Each candidate for a degree is required to prepare and submit to
the Faculty a thesis of at least 30 folio pages upon some legal
subject, the selection of which is left to himself. This should be
50	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
submitted about a month before graduation, and it must be satisfac-
tory both in substance and manner of treatment. The writer
is expected to read it before the Class. The elementary
text-books may be read collaterally with the Lectures, though
these are more comprehensive than in other Law Schools, and j
cover all subjects likely to arise in connection with actual prac-
tice or the most searching examination. They deal with all
the living branches of the Law, and the student who writes full !
notes of them, and diligently studies the same, acquires a complete
and reliable knowledge of its principles. The decisions of the
courts are based upon these principles, and it is the aim of the ‘
course of instruction at Notre Dame to impress them upon the
mind in so clear and thorough a manner that they are not likely j
ever to be forgotten. Their relations to one another are pointed
out, the growth of subordinate rules from them is explained,
and their application to actual or hypothetical cases emphasizes
the important office they serve in furnishing a key to complicated
questions of law and equity.
While the Lectures impart as general a knowledge of the Law
as students require for admission to the Bar and practice in the
courts, it is nevertheless deemed advisable to urge them to pursue
concurrently a course of reading. The works here named are
recognized as among the most serviceable and popular of
Standard Law (Books.	f
Blackstone’s and. Kent’s Commentaries, Walker’s American
Law, Reeve’s or Schouler’s Domestic Relations, Angell and Ames
on Corporations, Parsons on Contracts, Williams or Washburn on
Real Property, Story on Agency, Stephen’s or Gould’s Pleading,
Greenleaf on Evidence, Edwards or Story on Bailments, Parsons

All these books may be made available in actual practice, and
consequently students need incur no special loss in purchasing as
many of them as they can find time to read. However, this is
a matter which, to a great extent, is left optional. It
is not regarded as essential to read in connection with the
Lectures more than a few of the works indicated in the preceding
list. The Lectures are prepared with reference to this fact ; and
one of the objects in view in so preparing them is to place at a
minimum figure	,
The Expenses
incident to pursuing the study of Law at Notre Dame. It does
not admit of doubt that many bright and worthy young men in
different parts of the country are deterred from gratifying a
cherished ambition to engage in the study of Law by the appre-
hension that they cannot meet the expenses necessarily incident to
doing so. They suppose that the single item of books demands an
outlay of from $150 to $300. But that supposition is erroneous.
The study of Law can be pursued at Notre Dame without any
noteworthy expense, aside from such as is voluntarily incurred. In
that particular there is probably no university in the country that
surpasses this in the inducements offered to students. The Law
Library of the University, which contains all the standard text-
books, as well as the Reports of all the States and Territories,
and of all the Federal Courts, is free and open at all reasonable
hours to the students of this Department. The Law Lecture
room is scrupulously neat, well lighted, and furnished with
desks for the students. It is one of the most commodious rooms
in the building. While the incidental expenses are merely
nominal, the accommodations, including board, lodging, wash-
ing, etc., are excellent in all respects. The course of study
covers a period of ten months in the year. In other well
known institutions the annual duration of the professional
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
courses is from six to nine months. In view of all these
things, it is believed that the study of law is attended with less
•expense here than in any other well known law school. But it is
hardly necessary to indicate more particularly in this connection
the special advantages offered to students of this Department
Course of Study.
The Lawr Course covers a period of three years. But in cases where
students are entitled to advanced standing, by reason of previous study,
or where they daily attend two Lectures and the “Quiz Class,” they
maybe graduated in two years or less, providing they satisfactorily
acquit themselves in the final examination. The authorities have been
actuated by commendable motives in extending the Law Course
to three years. In the first place, they recognize that the standing
of the professions has been lowered by a too indiscriminate admis-
sion to them of persons of limited education.. And they are aware
that to such persons, in most cases, a professional life offers numer-
ous disappointments, and but few laurels. It frequently proves to
be a life barren of results, and the fact is usually discovered too
late to admit of being effectually remedied. Having made their
choice, they find themselves, as a rule, subject to circumstances
that forbid a change of occupation. It is also recognized that,
generally speaking, young men do not make amends for defects
in education after taking upon themselves the stern duties of
practical life, and becoming involved in the engrossing cares and
ceaseless activities of business. To guard against such disappoint-
ments and mistakes, it is sought to make graduation in this Depart-
ment a sufficient test of the education and professional qualifications
of the student to assure him that he is making a proper choice, and
to assure the profession that he may be admitted to its ranks with-
out detracting from its dignity, compromising its honor or lowering
its standard.
With a view, therefore, to supplying young men with a good
general education, as well as with thorough professional knowledge,
all the departments of the University are open to them. Without
extra expense, they may enter the classes and pursue the studies of
the Scientific and Classical Courses, and be graduated in the same,
4
J
LAW COURSE.
if they so desire. As they find time and have inclination, they may
study Mathematics, the Natural and Physical Sciences, Literature,
Ancient and Modern Languages, etc., in connection with the Law.
And thus the authorities of the University seek to meet the most
exacting expectations of its friends, and the public generally, by
assuring to students of this Department not only qualifications of a
high order in the profession, but also a sound general education.
Such are some of the considerations that have actuated the
authorities to extend the Law Course to a period of three years.
Students of this course mingle with other students of the Uni-
versity, and, without distinction, have the same advantages, privi-
leges and accommodations. They are likewise subject to the same
rules of discipline. These rules have been adopted with reference
to the acknowledged fact that a high moral standard is an import-
ant requisite of an honorable and successful career. They are
designed to shape the lives of students in accordance with such
standard, and to inculcate at the same time a wholesome tone of
manly dignity and honor, as well as a just appreciation of the •
claims of social and professional ethics.
III.—CIVIL ENGINEERING.
ANDIDATES for admission into this Course must exhibit
proof of proficiency in the art of Drawing as laid down in
the Scientific Course, and must pass a thorough examination, such
as is required of Scientific graduates, in Chemistry, Physics,
Geology, Mineralogy, and in the several branches of Pure and
Mixed Mathematics. The Course of Civil Engineering can then
be completed in one year, as follows:

a week to the exercises of the laboratory and workshop, and to
give good evidence of manual dexterity, and an acquaintance
with all the operations of the machine-shop, the wood-working
departments, foundry, and blacksmith-shop. The exercises of the
fourth year will be confined chiefly to the making of precise
measurements, the testing of materials, engines, pumps, boilers,
etc., a tour of inspection, original research, and preparation of
thesis.
Candidates for the Freshman Year must pass an examination in
the Commercial Course, Ancient and Modern History, Algebra

SHIS Course requires two years’ study for graduation : it in- ;
eludes arithmetic, grammar, letter-writing, geography, United :
States History, reading, orthography, penmanship, book-keeping, !
and Commercial Law,—in other words, all the branches of a i
complete business education.	i
Considering the character and needs of the country — especially i
of the great West in which we live—this course is the most prac- i
tical, and one of the most important that an educational institution ,
can afford.	1
Those, therefore, who have not the time or the means to take a	'
complete College course, in the Classics and Sciences, would do	;
well to enroll themselves in the Commercial Course. No plan of ;
study is more injudicious than a hap-hazard selection of such
studies as an inexperienced young man may fancy. The training
resulting from a fixed course of studies is of the utmost benefit to ,
the student.	.
The Commercial Course at Notre Dame has always received	,
the most careful attention from the officers and Commercial	!
Faculty of the University. Notre Dame claims to give the grad-
uates of this course a more complete business training than can be
obtained in any purely commercial college. Believing that a busi- |
ness education includes something more than a mere knowledge of •
Book-keeping, and that a good education cannot be had in a few	j
weeks, the authorities have extended this course over two years,	I
the shortest time in which the studies necessarily used in business |
life can be mastered. Should a student desire during this period 1
to pursue any other studies in which he may be interested, and for	;
which he has time, he will have liberty to do so. General History	j
and Linear Drawing are especially recommended to the students
of this course. They will also in the future have the opportunity ;
of attending an elementary course of the Physical and Natural	:
Sciences. Many commercial students find it also to their advantage	1
to take up the study of German or French, for which there are I
the amplest facilities. A talented and studious young man may *

thus in the course of two years find himself in possession of a ■
most valuable practical education, which will fit him to take his
place in the front rank of educated business men.

TT7HE students in this Course occupy themselves with Philoso-
phy, History, and the Natural and Physical Sciences. Law, :
Medicine, and Civil Engineering are optional studies of the Course.
Civil Engineering.
The Course of Civil Engineering has been established of late
o	o
years, and it affords advanced students the opportunity of fitting
themselves for the practice of this eminent profession.
The (Department of (Physical and Natural Sciences*
Notre Dame has always given special attention to the cultivation
of the Physical and Natural Sciences, but during the past few I
years extra efforts have been made in this direction, with a view of
affording to her students all the facilities and advantages that may
be found elsewhere. A large and commodious building, in the
Romanesque style, known as “Science Hall,” has been erected for
I this purpose, and it is the intention of the authorities to make it as
perfect in all its appointments as any similar institution in the
country. It is one hundred and thirty-one feet long by one I
hundred and four feet deep, and proportionally high. There are I
upwards of twenty-five spacious, well lighted and well ventilated
rooms in the building, nearly all of which are designed either as
lecture rooms or laboratories for the various branches of experi-
। mental science.
The building has been carefully planned for the purposes to
which it is appropriated, and embodies in its construction all the
improvements and conveniences to be found in the most approved
scientific structures of this country and Europe.
Special attention has been given to make the building convenient
both for the professor and student. The laboratories, lecture-rooms,

and cabinets are so connected with each other, and with the grand
apartments set aside for the museum, that specimens and apparatus
are always at hand when desired, and where they can be used.
The students of Natural History have their specimens systematic-
ally arranged in rooms adjoining their laboratories, whilst the stu-
dents of Chemistry and Physics have their cabinets conveniently
near, and, at the same time, independent of each other, owing to
the peculiar plan of the bifilding. The various classes can enter
the rooms and laboratories without interfering in any way with
one another, and can continue their studies and experiments indefi-
nitely without interruption. The general principles of science are
taught by lectures, and these are supplemented by practical work
in the various laboratories.
In Chemistry and Physics the necessary apparatus are at the dis-
posal of the student, and he is expected to verify, by observation
and experiment, what has not been experimentally illustrated in
the lectures he has attended.
In all these departments, as well as in those of Physics and
Chemistry, special stress will be laid on practical work, and a stu-
dent’s proficiency will be estimated by his record of observation
and experiment in the laboratory and workshop.
In the study of Botany, Zoology, and Physiology, each student
is provided with a microscope and the necessary accessories, and
most of his time is spent in microscopic study, under the direction
of the professor.
In Geology and Mineralogy the system is the same. The stu-
dent commences work in the laboratory at once, and thus early
becomes acquainted with the various minerals, rocks, fossils, etc.
The blowpipe, microscope, polariscope and clinometer are in con-
stant use to verify what has been learned in the lecture room, and
to fix it on.the memory.
In the Department of Mechanical Engineering there are fully
equipped workshops, for wood and metals. Steam engines and
dynamo-electric generators, and motors of various types and
sizes furnish the power required, and afford the students special
facilities in making experiments concerning the various forms of
energy.
<3
MISCELLANEOUS.	69
A Photographic Laboratory is also fitted up in the building,
where the student is enabled to learn, practically and in a short
time, the art of modern Photography, and thus prepare himself
for professional work in the studio.
Rooms have likewise been set aside for Assaying and Metal-
lurgy, and it is the purpose of those in charge to leave nothing
undone to make the work in this department compare favorably
with that accomplished in the others.
Additions of apparatus, specimens, and books for reference are
constantly being made to the various departments, and no effort
will be spared to make “Science Hall” a recognized center of
thorough work in genuine practical science.
Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre
Dame to promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of
which is so necessary for business or scientific purposes.
The German language—the classes of which are so numerously
attended—has been taught by five instructors during the past scho-
lastic year. The number of students attending the German classes
is becoming greater every year. The study of French is recom-
mended to all the students of the Collegiate Course. The course of
Spanish will receive special attention in the future, and other
modern languages may be taught when required.
Telegraphy, and Type=Writing.
These branches invite the special attention of the students of the
Commercial Course. Both departments are fully equipped for
practical work. The Telegraphic Department is superintended
by a skillful electrician, and the classes are under the personal in-
struction of an experienced operator who has seen much actual
service and held responsible positions on railroad work.
In the Type-writing Department the machine in use is a first-
class Remington, with the latest improvements. Thorough
instruction is given in the manipulation and care of the machine,
in the correct forms of business letters, law work, essays, and gen-
eral writing.

(Phonography, or Shorthand,,
of which Dr. Johnson said “its usefulness is not confined to any
particular science or profession,” is of incalculable benefit in the
higher branches of education, enabling its possessor to take ver-
batim notes of lecture', etc. It is adaptable to the English, French,
German or Spanish languages. With a good English education
it is a profession in itself, and one not likely to be overcrowded
for years to come. First-class phonographers and type-writers are
always sure of employment, and pupils in both branches here find
every facility to fit them for the highest grades of practical work.
Phonography and Type-writing have of late come into general
use in legal and commercial work—in the court, the law office,
and the counting room; in business houses, banks, insurance and
railroad offices, etc.,—and, for first-class stenographers especially,
the demand exceeds the supply. A knowledge of these useful arts
will therefore prove a strong recommendation for confidential and
lucrative positions.
Elocution.
No educational institution in the country surpasses Notre Dame
in the facilities afforded to students for acquiring proficiency in
elocution. The instruction is thorough, the exercises are practical,
and the subjects of study exhibit judicious variety. These exercises
are held in St. Cecilia Hall, which is peculiarly adapted for the
purpose, being eligibly situated, large, and elegantly furnished.
The exercises constitute an important part in the studies of young
men who strive to cultivate, with success, literature, oratory, and
the dramatic art. The approved methods of stimulating and de-
veloping the natural elocutionary powers are called into requisition
as occasion seems to warrant. To this end the drama receives
a due share of attention; from time to time an appropriate tragedy
or comedy is rendered by students, on the stage of the new
Music Flail, with all the customary accessories and appointments
used in connection with dramatic performances. Four public ex-
hibitions are given during the year, and public literary exercises
are held seven times during the same period. An oratorical con-
test is one of the notable features marking the close of the year.
MISCELLANEOUS.
n
For the purpose of encouraging and stimulating students to put
forth their best efforts, premiums and gold medals are offered to
those who most distinguish themselves. When all these thing's are
duly considered, there need be no hesitation in repeating that “no
educational institution in the country surpasses Notre Dame in the
facilities offered to students for acquiring proficiency in elocution.”
^Anatomy and Materia Medica.
Young men desiring to prepare for the Medical profession will
find opportunities to do so at Notre Dame. The Course of Stu-
dies in this department embraces Materia Medica, Anatomy, and
Surgery.
(Drawing and (Painting.
The University, which is becoming every year more widely and
favorably known as an art center, enjoys ample facilities for im-
parting instruction in thi- branch. It possesses a large number of
models, a fine studio, and qualified and zealous teachers of the art.
The eminent artist Signor Luigi Gregori, of Rome, is still in
charge of the Department.
Music.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has
able Professors, and is divided into classes on the regular Con-
servatory system. An Oichestra of fifteen pieces, an excellent
Quartette, and a Brass Band of twenty-five instruments are some
of the leading features of the Instrumental Music Department.
Vocal Music, to which special attention has been paid, and which
has contributed so much to the pleasure of the students during the
past few years, will receive even more careful attention in future,
and it is hoped that this branch will become every year more
popular.
DieadingMtoorns.
The lower floor of the New Music Hall is divided into large and
neatly furnished Reading Rooms, for the benefit of the Senior and
Junior departments. These reading rooms are supplied with
books and periodicals from the library, and students have access to
them during the hours of recreation.

The L&monnier Library

the Library Association desire to give their Alma Mater a codec-
tion of books which can stand comparison with those possessed by
any other educational establishment in the United States; therefore
they call on the friends of the University to assist them by dona-
tions of hooks, pamphlets, periodicals and manuscripts. All con-

MINIM DEPARTMENT.
T7OR the care and training of boys under the age of thirteen,
there has been established a Department to which the most
scrupulous attention has always been paid by the College au-
thorities; it is known as the Minim Department, and has ever
been one of the greatest objects of interest to the Faculty as well
as to all persons visiting Notre Dame.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in ad the elementary
' branches of an English education is here imparted, together with
! a rudimentary knowledge of Latin, French and German. Vocal
Music and Drawing form no extra charges. ‘The pupils of this
: Department are taught by Sisters of the Holy Cross, under whose
maternal and tender care they pass nearly the entire day. During'
the hours of recreation, and while in the refectory and dormitory,
they are under the charge of kind and efficient Prefects.
(Discipline.
।
i The following is the order of the day: Rising, at half-past six;
; toilet, etc.; seven, breakfast, after which there is a short time
given for exercise in the Campus; half-past seven, study; half-
' past nine, recreation and lunch; ten, study; a quarter to twelve,
toilet; twelve, dinner, followed by recreation; half-past one, study;
i half-past three, recreation and lunch; half-past six, supper and rec-
reation; half-past eight, retiring. From this it may be seen that
’ while the Minims devote never less than six hours a day to study,
. they are never more than two hours in succession in the class-room.
The recreation and exercise in the fresh air, between each two
hours of study, unbend the mind and prepare the boys to return to
their classes refreshed and ready for work.
The Minims are always under supervision, during the hours of
recreation, as well as in the class-room and study-hall. The pres-
ence, however, of the Prefects is far from being a restraint on the
amusements of the bo\s: for while it is the duty of the Prefects to
: insist that their young charges shall always keep within the limits



-	MINIM DEPARTMENT.	75
of the strictest propriety, they, at the same time, take part in all
sports, organize games, and do everything in their power to foster
a love of healthful exercise. The play-grounds consist of a fine
level five-acre field, well supplied with turning-poles, swings,
ladders, rings, parallel-bars, and all other necessary gymnastic
apparatus. That the boys make good use of them can best be
seen from their healthy, happy appearance, which invariably
attracts the notice of visitors.
Connected with the play-ground is a fine brick play-hall, 160
feet long, heated by steam. There the boys play in rainy or cold
weather. In this building is one of the finest hand-ball alleys at
Notre Dame. Adjoining the grounds is a large orchard to which
the Minims have access in proper season. They are allowed so
many privileges of a similar nature that, among the students of
the other departments, they are often pleasantly spoken of as the
“privileged class of the little college world.” The sisters preside
at the toilet; they clean and mend the clothing, see to all the needs
and to the comfort and convenience of the Minims. Baths are
taken every Saturday. Underclothing is changed regularly twice a
week. Great care is taken that the boys be neatly dressed, and that
the clothing be suitable for the season. As the Sisters take entire
charge of all these details, boys six years of age are received.
They are separated from the larger Minims, and enjoy all desirable
privileges.
Societies. ’
There are two societies in the Minim Department : that of the
Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its object to
supply servers for the Church offices ; and the Sorin Association,
which has been established with a view to give the pupils a start,
as early as possible, in Elocution. The Society is in charge of one
of the Professors, who finds it a pleasant duty to draw out the
talent of these interesting young orators. Meetings are held
once a week, after school hours. These meetings are a source of
pleasure as well as of profit. The members prepare original com-
positions, deliver declamations, are trained to debate, etc. Only
the best behaved and more advanced in studies are admitted to
membership. To encourage this young Literary Society, a Gold

Medal is annually awarded at Commencement, for Elocution, to
the most deserving member.
General Remarks.
The discipline to which the Minims are subjected is much milder
than that which is suited to students more advanced in age.
Recourse is scarcely ever had to punishment. Those in charge
endeavor to govern by kindness and gentleness, and by appealing
to the boys’ sense of honor. The names of all whose conduct and
application to studies are satisfactory appear under the heads of
Roll of Honor and Class Honors in the Scholastic, a paper pub-
lished weekly at Notre Dame. To find his name mentioned in
these rolls is found to be as great a reward for the deserving pupil,
as its non-appearance is a punishment for the undeserving.
Then, again, there is a Gold Medal awarded at the end of two
full years to all whose deportment has been unexceptionable during
that period. As this fact is made known to the Minim immediately
after his entrance, he generally endeavors to shape his conduct with
a view to receiving an cc Honor.” The greatest care is taken to
form their young hearts to habits of virtue, and to inculcate the
practice of refined manners. Every effort is made to foster respect
and affection for parents, to whom they are expected to write once
a week.
Not the least of the advantages enjoyed by the Minims is their
complete separation from the larger students. An elegant and
commodious building, known as St. Edward’s Hall, affording
ample accommodation for over one hundred pupils, is devoted to
their use. It is four stories in height, ninety-five feet long and
forty five wide ; heated by steam, supplied throughout with the
Edison incandescent electric light, and provided with hot and cold
.water. The ceilings in the Study Hall, Class Rooms, and sleeping
apartments are fifteen feet high. The windows are large and
numerous, affording abundant light and ventilation. The Study
Hall commands a charming view from each of its eleven large
windows. It is tastefully decorated with statuary, beautiful pic-
tures, choice plants, and beautiful flower caskets, etc. Besides the
pleasure the Minims derive from studying in this bright, beautiful
Study Hall.

hall, their habits and tastes are cultured by coming into contact
with such refining objects. Fronting the building is a handsome
park, which, with its sparkling fountain, tare trees and flowers,
( adds not a little to the beauty of St. Edward’s Hall as well aS to
i	-
( the happiness of the Minims.	•
i These remarks, which have been made to satisfy patents and
others who frequently write f >r more detailed information, will
show that, while the Minims haxe every possible advantage to aid
them in acquiring a good, solid education, they have also a most
happy home where they enjoy the same ease and freedom as they
would under the care of their motheis.

The AiMicoufratermty of the Sacred and Immaculate Heart
of Mary.
This pious Association is affiliated with the Archconfraternity
of the Sacred and Immaculate Heart of Mary, established in the
Church of Our Lady of Victories, in Paris. Its primary object is
to pray for the conversion of sinners and persons in error. It
furthermore aims at the mutual edification and personal sanctifi-
cation of all its members. The Archconfraternity is the oldest
society in the University, and recruits its members from amongst
the Catholic students of the Senior Department. It was canon-
ically established at Notre Dame by Very Rev. Father Sorin in
1845, and bids fair to continue to be in the future, as it has been in
the past, for the Senior students of Notre Dame a source of many
blessings .from the hands of their tender-hearted Mother the Im-
maculate Mother of God. Number of members, 147.

The Hoynes Light Guards.
The batallion has within the past two or three years attained to
a degree of proficiency in military tactics that entitles it to a high
rank among the cadet military organizations of the Northwest.
It is armed with “three-click” Springfield rifles of the latest pattern,
and supplied with all the requisite accoutrements of light infantry.
It comprises two companies, and has a total membership of aLout
125. These companies are composed respectively of Seniors and
Juniors, all of whom are tastefully uniformed, and have a soldierly
appearance and bearing. Their proficiency in the use of arms has
long been a subject of general remark and compliment. They
are taught the maneuvers, manual of arms, and all the ordinary
evolutions described in “Upton’s United States Tactics.” In what
is technically known as the school of the soldier and the school of
the company they are instructed by their captains, lieutenants, and
non-commissioned officers, while in battalion or regimental drill
they come more immediately under the command of the Colonel.
Enlistment is altogether voluntary. No student need become a
member of either company unless he desires to do so. However,
the authorities of the University duly encourage such organizations
on account of the salutary physical exercise they afford, the respect
for wholesome discipline they tend to establish, and the manly
bearing they serve to promote.

especially for their use, and all necessary accoutrements. Their
uniform is of a handsome blue, causing the company to present a
most attractive appearance. They are instructed in the manual of
arms and such evolutions as are deemed suitable for boys of their
size and age. They are under the command of Captains Cusack
and Craig, and during the past year the company was composed
of 60 members.

SORIN HALL.
SORIN HALL.
ROR several years the authorities of the University of Notre
Dame have had under consideration the advisability of providing
additional quarters for the special use and accommodation of stu-
dents of the higher classes. As a first step in that direction, about
four or five years ago, they began to furnish private rooms to such
of the advanced students as desired the same. Young men of the
graduating classes at once manifested so decided a preference for
these rooms that the power of the officers of the University to
supply them was taxed to the utmost. With a view to avoiding
the unpleasant task of discrimination in such cases, impossible as it
was to furnish rooms to all applicants, a moderate charge in addi-
tion to the regular rates of tuition was fixed and imposed upon
those taking the rooms. No objection was made on this account.
The only complaint was as to the paucity of rooms. Moreover, no
evil results seemed to attend the change thus made from the dor-
mitory and study-hall system. Confirmed in studious habits and
becoming regard for discipline, the young men to whom rooms
were given exhibited under the new arrangement no dim-
inution of interest in study, no loss of zeal in class-work, and no
notable derelictions in observing the rules of correct and manly
deportment. Their work continued diligent and effective.
In view of these facts, it became manifest that an additional
building would ultimately have to be erected for the special use of
advanced students. And of late years students of advanced stand-
ing have been so steadily increasing in number that, even months
ago, it was evident that the time for erecting the new building
had arrived. It became apparent that it was imperatively needed, and
that work upon it could no longer be deferred. Hence, ground
was broken and the work begun as soon as building operations
could conveniently be commenced in the spring of 1888. The
corner-stone was laid with imposing ceremonies on the 27th day of
May, in the course of the celebration of the sacerdotal golden j ubilee of
the Very Rev. E. Sorin, the venerable founder of the University of
i2o	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Notre Dame, and Superior General of the Congregation of Holy
Cross. Hence it was, under the inspiration of that happy occasion,
suggestively and appropriately named “Sorin Hall.”
. At present work upon the new building is progressing with all
possible speed*. Indications point to its being ready for occupancy
at the opening of the next scholastic year, or about the time pre-
scribed for the resumption of class-work in September. The con-
tractors promise to have it ready early in that month. As to the
size and appearance of the building it may unhesitatingly be stated
that it will be an edifice spacious and superb. It will have the
usual modern improvements, be complete in all its appointments,
and rank as one of the most attractive and substantial buildings on
the premises. The best brick and stone procurable and a superior
quality of slate 'will be used in the construction of the walls, roof,
etc.
According to the plans of the architect, the style of the building
is what is currently called mixed Gothic and Roman. The height
from ground to apex will be about 70 feet. The total number of
rooms can hardly fall short of the approximate aggregate of 125. It
has a measurement of 144 feet along its front, or from north to south,
while in depth, or from east to west, it measures 112 feet. The
basement, about two-thirds of which is over the ground level, has
a height of 9 feet from floor to ceiling. Above the basement the
structure rises to the altitude of three stories. The distance
from the first floor to the ceiling is 15 feet; from the second
floor to ceiling, 13 feet, and from the third floor to ceiling, about
12 feet. Three wide and substantial staircases afford ample means
of passing readily from floor to floor. The basement will be ap-
propriately subdivided into lavatories, bath-rooms, boiler and engine
rooms, etc. The building is to be heated throughout by an automatic
self-feeding apparatus placed in the basement. On the first floor are
to be two or more of the principal offices, a chapel, law lecture room,
moot-court room, law library, society rooms, etc. A large room in the
north part of the building will serve as a chapel, while the law rooms
are to be south of the entrance, with an east and south exposure. All
of them will be of ample size, and well fitted for the uses they are
severally intended to subserve. The second and third floors are
to be almost exclusively appropriated for rooms, corridors, etc.
SORIN HALL.	121
The average measurement of the rooms may he approximated at
12X12 feet—a size that must appear amply sufficient for all practical
purposes when it is remembered that the intention is to have only one
occupant in each room. The round-cornered rooms on the second and
third floors are to be occupied by some of the professors. These rooms
have a measurement of 12x18 feet. The corridors have an aver-
age width of 8 feet. The building will be commodious, thor-
oughly ventilated, and the rooms and corridors wrell lighted.
Sorin Hall faces east. Its location is about the same distance
southwest of the main building that Science Hall is southeast of
it. These two buildings face each other. The new one stands
with reference to the church in about the same position as that
occupied by Science Hall with reference to the Music or Exhibition
building.
The next and last subject worthy of special mention in this con-
nection is, What class or classes of students have a right to claim
rooms in the new building ? Of course, there must be some test of
eligibility, for it would be prejudicial to wholesome discipline and
the welfare of the students generally to suffer all applicants, or
applicants indiscriminately, to have rooms. Experience has de-
monstrated that for the younger boys the dormitory and study-hall
system cannot be excelled. The vigilance and restraint it implies
are more conducive to effective work and good morals than the
comparative isolation and larger measure of latitude necessarily
incident to the private room system. In short, the younger
boys do their best work and are most industrious when kept under
the supervision of experienced and responsible prefects. But such
supervision is to a great extent unnecessary in the case of earnest,
industrious, intelligent and well-disposed young men. And a young
man in the junior year of a collegiate course should certainly have
attained to the proposed standard — the standard of earnestness, in-
dustry, intelligence, good-will and a manly sense of honor. Hence,
it is deemed safe to fix upon students of the junior, as well as upon
those of the senior year, as possessing the qualifications requisite
to justify them in claiming rooms. To be more specific, it may be
stated that students of the junior and senior years in the courses of
classics, science, literature, civil and mechanical engineering, or in
mixed courses, will hereafter be entitled to rooms in the new building.
i2 2	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
This privilege extends also to law students whose educational qual-
ifications entitle them to the standing of juniors in the collegiate
courses.
No extra expense for rooms will be incurred by members of the
graduating classes, or by others who conform to the prescribed
tests of eligibility. However, should young men of unexception-
able standing, although ranking below the educational stand-
ard prescribed, wish to have rooms in the new building, the
authorities would feel free to consider their claims to the privilege,
in the light of the discretion that an impartial sense of duty must
compel them to exercise in such cases. But, for reasons already
stated, it would be deemed necessary in such instances to charge
specially for rooms at the rate of $100 per annum. The aim of
the authorities is to make the new system contribute as much as
possible to enhance the welfare of all the students—contribute to
promote the advantage of all concerned — and hence they must
reserve the right to prescribe and enforce from time to time such
reasonable rules as they may deem necessary or conducive to
that end.
THE
N otre Dame Scholastic
is the title of a neat 24-page paper, devoted to the interests of the
students, which is published at the University every week during Term
time. This journal opens a field for young writers, who might other-
wise, for want of a proper medium, allow their talents to remain
inactive.
The Scholastic contains articles of an instructive and literary
character, interesting Biographical Sketches, Essays, Poetry, Notes on
Art, Music, Science and Literature, Notices of New Publications,
etc., etc.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic has a local im-
portance for students, their parents, and all who have attended class at
the University in times past, on account of the weekly summary of
events transpiring at Notre Dame, personal notices of former students,
Rolls of Honor, Class Honors, List of Excellence, etc., which appear
in its columns every week. Reports relative to the arrangement of
classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic students,
etc., also find a place in this paper, and keep parents and others in-
formed on all that concerns their children and friends.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors, during the coming year, to
merit the encouragement given the paper in the past, and the en-
comiums bestowed upon it by the press in general.
