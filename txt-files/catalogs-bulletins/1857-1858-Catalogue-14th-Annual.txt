Besides various Tutors of the Preparatory Department.

The University os’ N otre Dame issues this, its four-
teenth annual Cataloguej under circumstances cheering and
encouraging, beyond those of any previous year of its ex-
istence. The course of study has been methodized anew,
has been greatly enlarged, and is, it is believed, rendered
fully adequate to the demands of the advancing culture of
the North-west; the corps of Professors and Tutors was
never before so numerous and efficient; to which may be
joined the scarcely less important consideration that each,
succeeding year has witnessed large and expensive addi-
tions to the material facilities for imparting a thorough and
complete education.
The Literary Department, the only one as yet fully
organized, is divided into a Preparatory School, in which
is given rudimental instruction up to the point where the
Student may profitably enter upon the course of an under-
graduate ; and a College proper where the full curriculum
of liberal studies requisite for graduation is pursued.
In the Preparatory Department, and in the lower Col-
lege classes, the usual catechetical or tutorial method of
teaching is adopted, the efficiency of which is largely

promoted by the systematic use of the blackboard in the
recitation room. In this stage of his education the utmost
pains is taken to ground the pupil thoroughly in principles,
to create and encourage a habit of self-reliant thought, and
to cater as little as possible for merely passive mind. In
the higher classes, as far as may be done with advantage
to the Student, the text-book is replaced by the Professors
own oral instructions. Already have been instituted
courses of lectures on Constitutional Law, on Logic, and
a course introductory to the study of metaphysic, on Eng-
lish Literature, and on Eloquence, in addition to those
occasional lectures which, from time to time during the
progress of the year, Professors find it necessary to give in
their several departments. The advocates of an education
more Christian than has hitherto prevailed in countries not
exclusively Catholic, will learn with pleasure that a course
of reading in Latin and Greek Patristic literature and elo-
quence, in the noble lyrics and hymnology of the Church,
and in Christian poetry generally, from Prudentius on-
wards, has been introduced among the studies of the two
last years.
The degree of A. B. will be conferred on such as shall
have completed in this institution the course of study pre-
scribed by the statutes, or, coining from other institutions
at least by the commencement of the senior year, shall on
examination be found prepared for the class to which they
apply for admission.
The degree of A. M. will be conferred on such of the
graduates in the first degree, as shall after leaving College,
have devoted full three years to professional, literary or
philosophical studies, and shall present to the faculty a the-
sis, or deliver an oration, on some subject relating to their
respective liberal pursuits.
NOTRE DAME UNIVERSITY.

Students who do not desire to graduate, may adopt a
partial or irregular course, fitting them for commercial life,
for civil engineering, &c., or for any pursuit outside of the
learned professions, which requires a special training.
Such a course would run parallel with the regular course,
and would include al] the advantages, literary and other-
wise, which the institution offers to its inmates in common.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquire-
ment of the French and German languages. Not only are
these languages taught very carefully by persons of ac-
knowledged competency, but many of the members of the
institution being natives of France and Germany, opportu-
nities at all times occur for conversation in these tongues.
There are in the College various societies of students,
formed for different objects—the St. Aloysius, a Literary
Society, St. Csecilia, a Musical Association; the Confra-
ternity of the Nocturnal Adoration, and the Arch-Confra-
ternity. There is also a Military Company composed of
the larger students, who have regular parades, the arms
and accoutrements being furnished by the State.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently en-
ergetic to preserve the most perfect order and regularity.
The morals and general deportment of pupils are assidu-
ously watched over, and their comfort and personal habits
receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of
their own families. Only conciliatory means of correction
are used, but if the student proves insensible to these, he
is promptly dismissed from the College.	’
Parents may rest assured that the utmost care will be
taken that their children comply regularly with their reli-
gious duties, and that no efforts will be spared in instruc-
ting them fully in the principles and obligations of their
holy religion.

NOTRE DAME UNIVERSITY.
Location.—The University of Notre Dame is situated
in the lovely valley of the St. Joseph, close by the banks
of that storied river of the North-west. It is in the midst
of a fine and proverbially healthy farming region, and by
means of two areat trunk lines of railroad, one of them
passing within a mile of the College grounds, easily and
quickly accessible from every part of the country. At the
depot at South Bend omnibuses or private conveyance can
be obtained; and in the town itself there is a spacious and
delightfully ventilated hotel, where every comfort may be
enjoyed.
Among the peculiar advantages which Notre Dame pre-
sents, as a place of Education, may be noticed,
1	.—Its Retired Location.—-At a time when solid stu-
dies are rare, when dissipations of every kind are thrown
in the way of the young student, and when mor-
als are but slightly watched over, it seems that eve-
ry parent who desires to secure to his son an op-
portunity of spending the few years of his education use-
fully and profitably, and passing safely the dangerous sea-
son of early youth, removed from all the temptations of
our large cities, should readily comprehend the advantage
of placing him in such an Institution as Notre Dame.
Here, the young student is under the most watchful and
paternal care—here he can apply himself, undisturbed, to
his studies, under competent Professors—‘and, on moderate
terms, he may acquire a solid knowledge of everything to
which he may wish to devote his attention—here, also, his
young mind breathes an atmosphere of piety, the influen-
ces of which will hover around him throughout his life.
2	.—Its Northern and Healthy Site.—This is a point
especially worthy the consideration of Southerners—the
change of air and location having a natural tendency to
NOTRE DAME UNIVERSITY*
9
produce the most salutary effects on the constitutions of
the natives of the Southern States.	'
3	.-—The Extensive Grounds of the Institution.—If
Students are here deprived of hurtful pleasures and dissi-
pations, they are amply remunerated by those delightful
and innocent amusements which the nature of the locality
so abundantly provides. The extensive forests surround-
ing the College give the best opportunities for hunting to
those who are fond of that sport; whilst the beautiful
Lakes, upon whose banks the University stands, afford
choice fishing grounds in summer, and almost uninterrupted
skating during winter.
4	.—-Care in Sickness.—Students, when ill, have not to
remain in the College rooms, but are transferred to the airy
and pleasant apartments of the Infirmary, where they are
attended by the visiting physician, and nursed with devo-
ted carecby experienced sisters, who never suffer them to
be alone, but strive to supply the place of their absent
mothers.
