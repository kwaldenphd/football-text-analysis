When the Congregation of Holy Cross planted its standard in the 8t.
Joseph Valley in 1842, the time of Very Rev. E. Sorin’s arrival, the pros-
pects of success were but moderate ; but the founder of the College, poor in
purse, yet rich in zeal and energy) strong in his Confidence in God, and in
his devotion to the Queen of heaven, the help of Christians3 to whom he
dedicated the great enterprise he was then beginning, has seen the College
gradually expand to its present growth, and gain the confidence of all who
have patronized it.
The University of Notre Dame
has attained its present honorable position among the^ educational institu-
tions of the United States by the steady and persevering efforts of its founder
and all connected with it to realize the object for which it was established :
to give an opportunity to the youth of America of obtaining a thorough ed-
ucation,—mental, moral, and physical.
The experience of a quarter of a century has shown that the system
adopted and gradually developed by the increasing importance of the Col-
lege is a good and efficient one. By strictly adhering to it the College has
sprung up vigorously, with no mushroom growth that gives no promise of
strength and long life, but like the sturdy oak that each year adds steadily
but surely to its strength. And though the “improvements”—a word so
familiar to all the friends of Notre Dame—that have been made in the
grounds and buildings are more apparent to the casual visitor, yet to those
intimately acquainted with the Institution it is evident that the same energy
and reliance in God, that have replaced the old log house on the lakeside,_
the only house on the premises when Very Rev. E. Sorin arrived—by the
buildings that are now seen, have been busy in increasing and perfecting the
means of rendering the youth of Notre Dame thorough students, while in
the Institution, and good citizens hereafter in the various Walks of life.
8
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
The Charter
of the Institution, granted by the Legislature of Indiana, in 1844, under the
name of “University of Notre Dame,” empowers it to confer degrees in all
the learned professions.	•
The University is conducted by the Fathers of the Congregation of Holy
Cross ; a number of highly competent Lay Professors assist in the various
branches of Studies , other Teachers and the Prefects of Discipline are sup-
plied by the Brothers of Holy Cross, who are, like the Fathers, devoted by
their sacred calling to the education of youth.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to pre-
serve the most perfect order and regularity. The morals and the general
deportment of the Pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts
• and personal habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom
of their own families.
The Location
of the College is one peculiarly adapted to the improvement of the Students.
It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot, naturally
beautiful, still more attractive by art and good taste.
We state only the advantages of
Health and Retirement
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution;—a description of all
that pleases at Notre Dame -would take us beyond the limits of these pages.
We prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons and to all who
think of confiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge
for themselves.
The advantages arising from the
Retired Position
of the College, cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart
the education of their children, and even the careless student when once in-
terested in his studies soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an un-
interrupted attention to class and study. Though secluded in a great meas-
ure from the busy world without, yet the number of Students and the ex-
9

tensive College Grounds, give him a world of his own, in which, what with
Class, Examination, Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Base
Ball Clubs, Dramatic and Musical Entertainments, he finds full- employment
and amusement, and companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix
his mind on his studies and. establish him in habits of piety, application and
order,—the influence of which will be felt his entire life. He breathes for
a few short years the atmosphere of order, regularity in all that he does, of
profound application to studies, broken only by healthy and regular recrea-
tion. and certainly, in our times, when serious and solid studies are becom-
ing so rare ; when all kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time
are forced upon young Students; when morals are so lightly watched
over, the advantage of the retired locality of Notre Dame cannot be too
highly spoken of.
Health.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health, and
those who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony that
the regular course of life, added to the salubrious climate, the fresh country
air, has done much to improve their sons, in health. In case of sickness
the student does not remain in the College rooms, but is immediately taken
to the apartments of the Infirmary, where he is attended and nursed with
devoted care by experienced Sisters, whose care for the sick needs no com-
mendation here to be duly appreciated.
The College Buildings
are on a slight eminence, near two small, picturesque lakes of pure spring
water, in the midst of the fine and healthy farming region of the Valley of
the St. Joseph, and scarcely a mile from that river. The locality can easily
be reached from all parts of the United States by means of either of two
great trunk lines of Railroad,—the Michigan Central, and the Michigan
Southern & Northern Indiana, the latter passing within a mile of the Col-
lege Grounds. At the Michigan Southern Railroad Depot, South Bend,
Omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained. Besides these, a Stage
running from South Bend to Niles passes the College twice a day. In
South Bend there are Hotels where every comfort may be enjoyed.
10
UNIVERSITY OF
NOTRE DAME.
The Main Building
is a structure one hundred and sixty feet long, eighty-five feet deep and six
stories high, surrounded by a well-proportioned dome, on the summit of
which stands a statue of the Blessed Virgin,—a beautiful work of art. The
exterior of this building, especially when viewed from the wide avenue that
I stretches a mile in front of the College, makes a favorable impression upon
all beholders; and the interior, admirably arranged and divided up into
I Study Halls, Recitation Rooms, etc, for the accommodation and comfort of
the Students who live—not merely study and recite—in it, completes the
good opinion already formed by a view of the exterior.
The Eastern Wing, eighty-five feet long, forty-five feet wide and six
stories high, contains the Dining-Room, Study-Hall, and Sleeping Apait-
ments of the Senior Students.
The Western Wing, of the same dimensions as the Eastern,-contains
the same apartments for the Junior Students. In
The Central Building are the Wash Rooms for Juniors and Seniors,
Parlors, private rooms for Professors, and Class Rooms, the Museum Library,
and College Chapel.
The Music Hall
stands to the east, a building one hundred feet long and forty-five feet
wide and two stories high. It is divided off into music rooms, each con-
taining a piano, and other instruments of music. Great attention has al-
ways been given to Vocal and Instrumental Music. The unprecedented
success this year of the Choir, the Philharmonic Society, the Band and Or-
chestra, under the direction of their respective Professors, is the best proof
that even more than the usual attention has been paid to this department
during the past ten months.
On the ground floor of this building is the
Juniors’ Recreation Hall,
occupying the length and breadth of the building. Close by is the Recrea-
tion Ground for the Juniors, and a little farther off are the grounds espe-
cially set apart for their great games of Foot-ball, Base-ball, and other sports
that require more space than is contained in the every-day play grounds.

Washington Hall?
a building one hundred feet long? fifty feet deep, a'nd two 'stories high,
lies to the south of the Mhsie Hall, and is devoted to Elocutionary and
Dramatic Exercises. All the Students of Notre Dame have pteasing mem-
ories of Washington Hall. The Commencement Exercises are held in it,
and frequently during the year the students repair to it with pleasure,
to be entertained by theit fellow-students with music, declamations and
dramatic performances. It has been newly fitted up, &nd is well'Suited for
the purpose for which it was built. On the ground floor is
_	i
The Seniors’ Recreation Hall,
which is properly fitted up for the daily amusements of the Seniors, having
on one side the ordinary recreation yard with Ball Alley zand Gymnastic
Apparatus, and on the other, more extensive ground's for the use of those
who indulge in Base-ball and other violent games.
The Infirmary?
and other buildings directly connected with the College? are in proportion
to the stee of the College. An Observatory is in contemplation, in which
will be placed the fine refracting

presented to the TJuivetsity by his Majesty, the Emperor of Era’nce. It is
one of the best instruments of the size ever manufactured. The focal length
of the instrument is ovet nine feet, and the diameter of the ofiject glass six
inches clear. There are two eye-piecCs for land objects, one of seventy-five,
and the other of one hundred, poweh
Before leaving this part of our Prospectus relating to Buildings? we must
mention several which, though they are not exclusively for college purposes,
do their part in making up the Establishment of Notre Dame, of which the
College Building is the centre.
The Church of the Sacred Hearts
to the west of the College Building, serves as a place of worship to the nu-
merous Catholics of the neighborhood, to the Students, and other inmates of
Notre Dame. It contains a fine toned Organ of thirty-two stops. The sa-
cred music performed in this Church is of a superior order. In the Church

tower is a peal of thirty-two bells—-the finest peal of bells in the United
States;—indeed, the only one of the kind. The base- of the chime is made
by the large bell recently imported from France, • and presented’ to the
Church of Notre Dame by the friends of the Institution. Its weight is
thirteen thousand pounds^and its diameter, >ah the base,- is- eight feet eight
inches*.
The Manual Labor School
which deserves- a- notice apart, has been removed from- its* former position
to give room to beautify and ornament more extensive grounds in front of
the College. It now stands near the Farm House, and all the Shops have
been moved to the same locality.
The Novitiates, and the Missionary’s Homey
situated in secluded' localities around* the lakes, complete tlie buildings con-
nected with the College, though we might add to the list the Printing Of-
fice of the Ave Mabia, in which is published the journal of that name, and
from which, for ten months in the year, issues The Scholastic YeaE/U
paper edited by the Students of- Notre Damez

The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, ,
the Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums, take place. It is
divided into two Sessons of five months each. At the termination of each
Session, a strict examination of all the different classes is made in the pres-
ence of the Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is ,
examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which his
previous attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion de-
pends on his application.and progress. Should any Student, during the •
year, be found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted,
and such promotion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the- Stu-
dents as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully ■
a strict examination before the Faculty.	’
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates ‘
of the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary or ;
Scientific Studies.	\
The Degrees of Bachelor of Science and of Master of Science will also be
conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will-be given to those Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination ‘before the Board of ,
Examiners,-and given clear evidence cf their moral character.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the 'French j
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very care- >
fully by persons of ’acknowledged competency, but many of the members of '
the Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all
times occur for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.	;

Students are not allowed to keep money in their possession; whatever
pocket-money parents may choose to allow to their sons must be placed in
the hands of the Treasurer of the Faculty, who will give it out as prudence
may suggest or occasion require.
No Student will be received for a shorter period than one session of five
months. The most eligible time for entering is at the beginning of a scho-
lastic session, viz: in September or February, but Pupils are admitted at all
times during the year, and their session commences with the date of their
entrance.
When Parents wish to have their children sent home, they must give timely
notice, settle all accounts, and supply means to defray all traveling expenses.
Should a Student withdraw himself, or be withdrawn by his parents or
guardians before the expiration of the session, no deduction is made, except
in case of sickness or absolute dismissal.

lege would be profitably employed, if nothing else were learned than to
converse and behave with the dignity and propriety of gentlemen.
The happiness^ no less than the improvement of Students, is so closely
connected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the College,
that no young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own welfare
and the accomplishment of his purpose in entering the Institution, can fail
to discover the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing Rules.
If the authorities of the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere and un-
wavering zeal in keeping those Regulations, they demand of Students noth-
ing more than the promotion of their own interest.

THI-l
During the Scholastic year we were delighted with the appearance pre-
sented by our Students in their neat and tasty dress, and we may say they
were no less pleased.
The advantages of a Uniform are many, a few of which it will be well to
mention: 1st. The Uniform is at least as cheap as any other fine suit, and
more economical, from the fact that greater care will be taken of it by the
wearer. 2d. It is very neat, and tends to make young men dress with care.
3d. It inspires a laudable spirit of self-respect, which forbids one doing
any thing low or mean. 4th. It requires young men to walk with that
upright form and firm step which are so conducive both to health and good
bearing in society.
The Uniform for Seniors is the same as that of a Lieutenant, viz:
single-breasted dress coat, pantaloons with gold cord, and vest single-breasted.
The Uniform for the Juniors is the same as that of the Seniors, except
the coat, in place of which the Juniors wear a jacket.
The Uniform for the Minims is a regular Zouave dress. Blue is the
color for each Uniform above mentioned.
* Those wishing to get the Uniform should deposit with the Treasurer of the Institution a
sum sufficient to cover the cost: for Seniors, from $38 to §43 ; Juniors, $25 to $30: Minims, $18
to $22. The Uniform should be made under the supervision of the College tailor.
It must be well understood that there is no obligation to get this Uniform, but parents and
guardians are invited to procure it.

SHIS Institution) situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is every thing that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Amademy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are
taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Mod-
ern Languages) form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of Catholic
pupils. Pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of
order, merely required to attend the public religious exercises with the
members of the Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious) suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all Modern Improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths
are attached to the sleeping apartments.
The G-roti ids are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
