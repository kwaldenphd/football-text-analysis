THIS UNIVERSITY was founded in 1842 by the Congregation of the
Holy Cross, under the direction of Very Rev. E. Sorin, and was chartered
by the Legislature'of the State of Indiana in 1844, with power to confer all the
:	usual degrees.
:	The College buildings are on an eminence near two small, picturesque
'	lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of the fine and healthy farming region
:	of the St. Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the river. The College
can easily be reached-from all parts of the United States and Canada by
means of three great trunk lines of railway—the Lake Shore and Michigan
■ Southern, the Chicago and Lake Huron, and the Great Western and Michigan
Central; the former passing within a mile of the College grounds, and the latter
connecting at Niles with the recently-built railway between that place and
.	South Bend, which runs within a half mile of the College. At the Michigan
<	Southern Railroad depot, South Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances can
j be obtained.
.	The buildings are well adapted for the purposes for which they were
erected. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleeping Apartments
, and Recreation-Halls are commodious, and capable of giving accommodation
j to five hundred resident students.
j	THZHl SITE
j	of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the Students.
]	It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot naturally
j beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
| We state only the advantages of
!	HEALTH JLISriD HETIHEMENT
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institution;—a description of all that
pleases at NotUe Dame would take us beyond the limits of these pages.
We prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons, and to all who think
j of confiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge for themselves.
j The advantages arising from the
j	BETIHEL POSITION
j of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart the
■ education of their children; and even the careless student, when once inter-
ested in his studies, soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an uninter-
| rupted attention to class and study. Though secluded in a great measure
I from the busy world without, yet the number of Students and the extensive
College grounds give him a world of his own, in which, what with Class,
Examination, Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Baseball Clubs,
Boat Clubs, Dramatic and Musical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment
and amusement, and companions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix
. •— -------------------------------------J--------------------------—----
I
his mind on his studies and establish him in habits of piety, application and
order—the influence of which will be felt during his entire life. He breathes
for a few shortyears the atmosphere of order, of regularity in all that he does;
of profound application to studies, broken only by healthy and regular recre-
ation; and certainly in our times, when serious and solid studies are becom-
ing so rare, when all kinds of inducements to waste and fritter away time are
forced upon young Students, when morals are so lightly watched over, the
advantage of the retired location of Notke Dame cannot be too highly
spoken of.
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health;
and those who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony
that the regular course of life, added to the salubrious climate and the fresh
country air, has done much to improve the health of their children.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to pre-
serve order and regularity. The morals and general deportment of the pupils
are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal habits receive
the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own families.
□7 ZEE ZE ZEZDTTO ATT OUST
given at Notice Dame is calculated to form both the heart and intellect of
the Students. Every attention is given to their moral and religious culture.
Every day the Students of the Junior Department have an opportunity of at-
tending classes where they may acquire an elementary knowledge of Christian
Doctrine. Twice a week lectures and instructions on religious topics are de-
livered to all the students together. Finally, a regular course of Dogmatic
Theology is established in the University for the benefit of the more ad-
vanced students who may desire to enter the world having their minds stored
not only with profane science, but also with what is much more important, a
thorough knowledge of their religion. The religious instruction is, of course,
confined to Catholic Students exclusively. The intellectual training is car-
ried on with care and diligence by the Officers and Professors of the Uni-
versity. The best systems of teaching are adopted, and the best authors for
each branch selected, so that no pains are spared to secure the objects which
the University has in view as an institution of education.
REGULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
’ All Students are required to attend the exercises of public worship with
punctuality and decorum.
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful towards the Pro-
fessors and Prefects -of the Institution—never absenting themselves from the
place in which they ought to be without permission from proper authority.
Students must carefully avoid every expression in the least injurious to
Religion or morals, their Professors, Prefects or fellow Students.
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden to such as have not permission
from their parents or guardians. Intoxicating liquors are absolutely prohibited.
Compensation for all damage done to the furniture or other property of
the College will be required from the person or persons causing such damage.
XO	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
’ Ko branch of study, once commenced shall be discontinued without per-
; mission from the Director of Studies.
i Ko one shall leave the University grounds without the permission of the
’ President or Vice-President
* Students are expected to take baths regularly.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the Class room, or who
; shall have been guilty of misconduct, shall perform such tasks as shall be as-
i signed them, and will be excluded from all College exercises until such tasks
be accomplished.
Ko book, periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into the College
* without being previously examined and approved by the Director of Studies.
. Objectionable books found in the possession of Students will be withheld
: from them until their departure from the University.

• The Academic Year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
. Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums take place. It is di-
vided into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each Ses-
sion, a strict examination of all the different classes is made in the presence of
' the Faculty. There is no vacation at Christmas or Easter.
! When a Student presents himself for admission into the College he is ex-
I amined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which his pre-
! vious attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends
• on his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be
J found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such pro-
| motion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
■ The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
; as shall have completed the Classical Course, and passed successfully an ex-
j amination in all the branches of the course before the Faculty.
i The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates
i of the first Degree who shall have devoted at least two years to literary or sci-
! entific studies.

| ence, and Civil Engineer, will be conferred on similar conditions.
i Diplomas will be given to the Students who shall have completed the
i Commercial Course and passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
! Examiners. In all cases, the Students receiving Diplomas are supposed to be
j of good moral character.
Ko Student will receive a Diploma or University Honor of any kind un-
। til such time as all indebtedness to the institution shall have been satisfac-
torily settled.
Special facilities exist at Kotue Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Kot only are these Languages taught very carefully

stitution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times oc-
cur for conversation in these tongues,
o
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions and
By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty; such as the Archconfraternity,
St. Gregory, Holy Angels, Holy Childhood, St. Aloysius Philodemic, Thes-
pian, St. Cecilia, Columbian. St. Stanislaus Philopatrian, and Philharmonic
Societies* Cornet Band, and two Orchestras, -with which Students are author-
ized and recommended to connect themselves.
[rgrTn case of sickness, the Student does not remain in the College
rooms, but is immediately taken to the Infirmary, where he is attended and
nursed with devoted care by experienced Sisters, whose attention to the sick
needs no recommendation.

All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included in the
Course. The Code and Common Law systems of Pleading and Practice are
taught. The Course of Studies in this department embraces chiefly, Ethics,
Political Economy, Constitutional and International Law, Municipal Law,
Law of Contracts, Equity Jurisprudence, Criminal Law, Evidence, Pleading
and Practice.
Pot the purpose of acquiring a practical as well as a theoretical knowledge
of the legal profession, the students shall during the Course be required to
argue cases, draw up pleadings, and conduct Law and Chancery suits accord-
ing to the rules and formalities of regular courts of justice.
As it is a matter of the highest importance to a young lawyer that on
being admitted to the practice of his profession, he should be able to express
himself clearly and fluently, full opportunities -will be offered for cultivating
the art of public speaking. As one means of attaining this end, and for the
purpose of familiarizing the Student with the practical workings of Ins- fu-
ture profession, Moot Courts, under the direction of a Professor, will be fre-
quently held during the Course. For the cultivation of other kinds of elo-
quence, still further facilities are afforded in the various Literary and Debating
Societies of the University.
In addition to the general course of instruction, students will receive
every assistance in studying the Laws peculiar to their respective States.
The entire course for those commencing the study of of the Law is in-
tended to be completed in two years, divided into four terms, which cor-
respond with those of the other departments of the University.
Every applicant for admission into this department is expected to have at
least a complete English education. It is very desirable that he should also
have a classical training before commencing the study of the Law; neverthe-
less, those who may not possess this advantage will, without extra charge, be
offered ample facilities for acquiring a knowledge of the classics while pur-
suing their legal studies.
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time, but
it is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves at the be-
ginning of a Term.
The Students will be required to pass through an examination at the
close of each Term, and also to present an essay of not more than seven pages
of legal cap on some of the matters which they shall have seen. The notes
of these special examinations and essays, as well as those of the application
and general standing of the members in class throughout the Law Course,
will be placed to their respective credits in the result of the final examination
for the degree of LL. B.

Post-Graduate Course.
The Students in this Course occupy themselves with Philosophy, History,
and the Natural Sciences. Law, Medicine, and Civil Engineering may be
optional studies of the Course.
Law Department.
We trust to see our Law Department better and better attended year after
year. We have every reason to be proud of the young men who each year
have sought the classic retirement of Notre Dame to pursue their Law Stud-
ies. We will endeavor to make their sojourn among us an agreeable one,
and will give them all the advantages for study.
Civil Engineering.
This important branch of study has been inaugurated with success, and
will afford our advanced students the opportunity of fitting themselves for
the practice of Civil Engineering.
Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame to pro-
mote the study of the foreign languages, the use of which is so frequent and
necessary for business or scientific purposes.
The German language, the classes of which are so numerously attended,
will be taught by three Professors during the next scholastic year. The num-
ber of German students attending the University is becoming greater every
year. The French language, though more especially the language of the Col-
legiate Course, will be of great advantage to the Scientific students. Other
languages—such as Italian and Spanish—may be taught when required.
Phonograpliy and. Telegraphy.
These two branches invite the special attention of the students of the
Commercial Course. The Telegraph Department is fully organized, and
placed under the management of a skilful electrician. It is very probable
that Notre Dame will be in direct communication with South Bend and the
rest of the world by electric wires before the end of 1875.
Anatomy and Materia Mediea.
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find oppor-
tunities to do so at Notre Dame. Yet, owing to the want of a sufficient mu-
seum whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the
course of studies in this department is limited, and embraces principally
Anatomy. The remainder of the course is completed in some of our neigh-
boring Universities. As a Preparatory Course, that which is given here,
under Bev. L. Neyron, M. D., leaves nothing to be desired.

SPECIALTIES.
Painting and Drawing.
The Drawing Classes each year show a large increase over the preceding
years. The University enjoys means adequate to all demands in this branch.
It possesses a large number of models in all sorts of drawings, a fine studio,
and a vigilant and zealous teacher of the art.
Painting promises likewise to be one of the popular branches of Art
taught at Notre Dame. The famous painter Gregori, of Rome, has been en-
gaged to give instructions in oil painting. His contract is to last three years.
Gregori has no superior in Rome.
Music.
& This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has five Pro-
fessors, and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory system. An
Orchestra of fifteen pieces, with an excellent Quartette, and a Brass Band of
twenty-five instruments, are some of the leading features of the Musical De-
partment.
Vocal Music has received special attention during the past year. A Pro-
fessor of merit has had charge of it, and. will continue during the coining
year. We call the attention of our students and patrons to this favorite and
useful branch of music, which is now so deservedly popular.
Astronomical Observatory.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which the
fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been placed. The
studies of the class of Astronomy are now rendered practically interesting.
Libraries.
The College Library contains some twelve thousand volumes, very care-
fully arranged by the Librarian. Donations of books, especially to the Law
’ Library, will be thankfully received.
The Circulating Library was commenced two years ago with four hun-
dred volumes-—it now numbers over two thousand. All the Libraries which
formerly belonged to the Literary and Religious Societies have been merged
into it. Instead of the dozen or more book cases which often hid away in-
structive books, a beautiful collection of Literary and Religious works is now
open to the students in an apartment fitted up as a Reading Room.

The Floly Childhood.
The primary object of the Society of the Holy Childhood, of which this
little Society forms a part, is to offer an opportunity to children throughout
the Christian world to contribute their share towards the redemption of Pagan
children from the darkness of heathenism. The monthly contributions of the
members of this Society are small, but the aggregate is considerable—while
thousands of children are by this means trained up to habits of charity.

Notre Dame Boating Club.
This Club was established in 1869, and has since grown to be one of
the most popular institutions at Notre Dame. The object of the Club is
principally to furnish its members with the pleasing and healthful exercises
of rowing, and also to contribute its share to the many pleasing features of
Commencement Day. It possesses two substantial boat-houses, two four-
oar barges, two six-oar barges, named the “Hiawatha” and “Minnehaha,”
and one staff-boat, the “ Nina.” Two races take place annually, one in
October and the other at the Commencement in June. There are, at present,
twenty-five active members in the Club.

A. WEEKLY EAEEB
Devoted to Literature., Science, Art, and Music.
J@XTl>s<Ci’ipl;ions $1.30 Per
This is the title of a paper published every week, except in vacation, at
the University of Notre Dame. The chief object of this paper is to keep
the parents and friends of our Students informed on the various subjects of
study and discipline at this University and at St. Mary’s Academy, and of the
progress of their sons and daughters in these two institutions. For this
purpose, regular weekly reports are given, consisting of the names of those
who deserve, by their excellent conduct, to be recorded on the “Doll of
Honor,” and who by th^ir perseverance and industry deserve special com-
mendation from their various professors and teachers. Other reports •
relative to the arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented
and energetic students, etc., also find place in this paper, and keep parents
and friends accurately informed on all that concerns their children.
This paper also opens a field for aspiring young writers, who might
otherwise, through timidity, allow their talents in this respect to remain
inactive; while many articles of an instructive and literary character, from
writers of mature mind and ability, render The Scholastic a valuable
publication for all who desire variety and utility in their reading. It con-
sists of sixteen two-column pages, wide measure.
In each week’s issue a general resume of all the Literary, Art, Musical
and Scientific news of general interest will be given, thus keeping the
students in the different departments posted concerning matters connected
with their studies and happening at the present time. Especial attention is
given to the events which transpire at Notre Dame, so that parents and others
may be kept posted concerning the daily life of their children or friends at
the College.	-
Addkess,
Editor “NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC,”
SAINT MART’S ACADEMY.
(Ous Me West of Wre Bane University.)
rjRHIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education
are taught here. Music, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the Modern
Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the religious instruction of Catholic
pupils. Pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of order,
merely required to attend the public religious exercises with the members of
the Institution.
The buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all modern improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths are
attached to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are re-
ferred to the Twentieth Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy, for the
year 1874-5, or address
ST. MARY’S ACADEMY,
Notre Dame, Indiana.
N. B.—The friends of the Academy will be pleased to learn that there is
a regular omnibus line between South Bend, Notre Dame and St. Mary’s,
which connects regularly with all the trains arriving at South Bend.
