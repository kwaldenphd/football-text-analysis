Notre Dame University.
Historical.
HE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME was founded
in the year 1842, by the Very Reverend Edward Sorin, now
Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Cross;
in 1844 it was chartered by the General Assembly of the State
of Indiana. It grew rapidly from a small frontier school to a
fairly equipped college, and at length assumed the proportions
of a University. On April 23, 187g, five of the college buildings
were destroyed by fire. The loss included the library, museums,
and scientific apparatus. The progress of the University, how-
ever, was arrested but for a short time. In September, 1879,
some of the colleges had been rebuilt, and the beginning of the
present extended group of buildings had been made. The new
order of things fulfilled a hope rather than a promise of the old,
and the Notre Dame of-to-day, with its equipment, its standard
of studies, and its increasing influence, more than realizes the
most sanguine expectations even of those who had the firmest
belief in the possibilities of higher education in the West. A
brief review of the
Material Equipment of the University
seems not inappropriate.
Main Building. This is five stories high; its dimensions are
320x155 feet. The distance from the ground to the electric
light just above the statue surmounting the dome is 207 feet.
This building contains museums, the libraries, art galleries, class
rooms, study halls, dormitories, lavatories, trunk rooms, arm-
ories, etc. The refectories are richty ornamented with mural
paintings, representing many of the most celebrated Ecclesiasti-
cal and Secular buildings in the world, and beautifully illustrat-
ing the progress of architecture. The lavatories are supplied
with hot and cold water, and have all the customary accommoda-
IO
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
tions. The armories contain about 150 stand of arms, with
bayonets, accoutrements, etc. These arms were procured from
the State, for the service of members of the military organiza-
tions. The reception parlors, and offices of the President, Sec-
retaries, and Prefect of Discipline are on the main floor, as are
also the study halls, several of the class-rooms, the telegraph
office, and the students’ office. This floor is of tile and the cor-
ridor is lined with a series of superb mural paintings (the work
of the distinguished Roman artist, Signor Luigi Gregori), which
illustrate the leading events of the life of Columbus, or, more
particularly, such of them as history associates with the dis-
covery of America. Portraits of distinguished ecclesiastics,
including almost all the Catholic Bishops in the United States,
those living as well as those who have gone to their reward, line
the walls of the corridors on the floor above, and it is appropri-
ately called the ‘-'Bishops’ Gallery.” The society-rooms are on
the same floor, as are also some of the class-rooms; they are
tastefully ornamented with paintings, mural decorations, and
busts of noted personages. Two large dormitories are likewise
on this floor. The Lemonnier Library and Memorial Hall are
on the third floor. Two large dormitories, that correspond in
size and appearance to those below, occupy the rest of the floor
The music-rooms of the vocal classes and the Department of
Drawing take up the greater part of the fourth floor. The
Lemonnier Library contains 50,000 volumes, besides miscella-
neous objects of interest gathered from all parts of the United
States, and many other countries. Three wide oaken staircases
afford communication between the different floors, from the first
story to the top of the building; and these, supplemented by
exits to the roofs of verandas and porticos, with ample means of
descending safely to the ground, remove all danger of personal
injury in case of fire. But the fullest precautions have been
taken to guard against that peril. With a watchman constantly
on duty, water on each floor and hose at hand, there is abso-
lutely no danger of fire. The halls throughout the building are
wide, high, and spacious. The many angles which distinguish
the building, were planned and constructed in accordance with
the prevailing style of architecture at Notre Dame, which is

11
known as modern Gothic. These angles serve to give strength
and solidity to the entire building, rendering it secure against
the fury of the -wind and storm, not to mention the incidental
advantages of good light and perfect ventilation which they
afford. Just east of the Main Building is
Music Hall. This is 170 feet in length by 100 in width, and
over 100 in height. The first floor is divided into recreation
and reading rooms, the north end being for the students of Car-
roll Hall and the south for the students of Brownson Hall.
These rooms are supplied with newspapers, periodicals, games
of all kinds, billiard-tables, etc. The dressing rooms of the
Bicycle Club and of the Athletic Association are also on this
floor. The second and third floors at the north end are divided
into music-rooms, and instrumental music is there taught.
The Exhibition Hall occupies the remainder of thebuilding.
In it are given the more formal lectures, as well as
oncerts and dramatic entertainments. Fully furnished with
the scenes, accessories and decorations appropriate to such uses
and capable of accommodating 1,200 persons, it ranks among
the largest and most attractive college halls in the country.
Science Hall. This imposing edifice is situated a few steps
south of Music Hall. The dimensions are 104x131 feet, and
the height is three stories, or 75 feet. It is divided into two
departments, and supplied with all the agencies requisite to
facilitate the accquisition of a complete knowledge of the sciences.
The laboratories, lecture-rooms, museums,biological department,,
engine-rooms, etc., are admirably arranged for the convenience
of students. The Hall is fully equipped with all necessary
chemicals, preparations, specimens, charts, tools, instruments,,
and the innumerable accessories of a great school of science.
The Brownson Hall campus or play-ground, a level tract contain-
ing about ten acres, lies southeast of it. South of it is the
Institute of Technology, a large and commodious building
devoted to the use of the students of civil, mechanical and elec-
trical engineering. It is fully equipped with all the appliances-
for wood and metal working, and is supplied with the most
approved forms of forges and cupolas for blacksmithing and

■foundry work. The rooms for mechanical drawing, and the
laboratories for special experimental work in mechanical engin-
eering, were specially designed for the purpose for which they
are used, and are complete in all their appointments. Directly
-south is the
Astronomical Observatory, which is conveniently situated
for astronomical observations and the work of class instruction.
The observatory consists of a main part, with a revolving dome,
an east wing, or transit room, in which is mounted the transit
instrument, and a north wing, or computing room, which con-
tains the smaller instruments and the works of reference for the
use of observers. East of Music Hall, for the accommodation
■of the students desiring to take physical exercise when the
weather is unfavorable for out-door sports, stands the
Students’ Play Hall, which measures 160 feet in length and
45 in width, and is two stories in height. The north half is for
the use of the students of Carroll Hall, whose campus surrounds
it, while the south’half is set apart for the students of Brownson
Hall. A thoroughly equipped gymnasium has recently been
fitted up on the second floor of the Institute of Technology.
Just north of the Play Hall and Music Hall is St. Edward’s
Park, and fronting this, facing south, is
St. Edward’s Hall, a building four stories high, and 155 feet
in length by 50 in width. This is for the exclusive use of pupils
under thirteen years of age. It is entirely separate from the
University, though under the same general management. The
building is new, and lacks none of the appointments suggested by
experience as useful or desirable. It is divided into study-halls,
•class-rooms, dormitories, etc. The recreation hall is just east
•of it, while farther east and north lies the play-ground. The
pupils are under the immediate direction of competent and exper-
ienced teachers—Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.
The Infirmary adjoins St. Edward’s Hall on the west. In
•dimensions it is 200x45 feet, and three stories high. The Gen-
eral Office occupies a portion of the first floor. The rooms on
the floor above are kept in readiness for the reception of stu-
dents who at any time are prevented through illness from attend-

U
ing classes and discharging their customary duties. The regu-
lar physician of the University, and the Sisters in charge minis-
ister to the sick in all cases.
The Church stands a little west and south of the main build-
ing. It is generally regarded as one of the most beautifully
decorated churches in the country. In size it is 275 x 120 feet,
and the distance from the ground to the apex of the roof is
about 125 feet. It is richly ornamented with paintings and
statuary, and hours may profitably be given to the examination
and study . of these and the objects of interest and
beauty in which it abounds. In its tower is the largest bell in
America. Besides, there are 32 smaller bells in the tower.
These vary in size and constitute the noted 4‘Chimes of Notre
Dame.” South and west of the church stands
Sorin Hall. The style of the building is what is currently
called mixed Gothic and Roman. The height from ground
to apex is about 70 feet. It has a measurement of 144 feet
along its front, or from north to south, while in depth, or from
east to west, it will measure, when completed, 112 feet. The
basement, about two-thirds of which is above the ground level,,
has a height of 9 feet from floor to ceiling. Above the base-
ment the structure rises to the height of three stories. The
distance from the first floor to the ceiling is 15 feet; from the
second floor to the ceiling, 13 feet, and from the third floor
to ceiling, about 12 feet. Two wide and massive staircases-
afford-ample means of passing readily from floor to-floor. The
basement is subdivided into lavatories, bath-rooms, boiler and
engine rooms, etc. The building is heated throughout by an
automatic self-feeding apparatus placed in the basement. On the
first floor are two or more of the principal offices, a chapel, the law
lecture court, moot-court room, law library, society rooms, etc.
A large room in the north part of the building serves as a chapel,,
while the law rooms are south of the entrance, with an east and
south exposure. The second and third floors are almost exclu-
sively appropriated for students’ rooms. The building is com-
modious, thoroughly ventilated, and the rooms and corridors-
are well lighted, and comfortably heated at all times.
14
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
A regularly established United States post-office is situated
-on the University grounds, a short distance from the main build-
ing. It is particularly intended for the accommodation of the
University and St. Mary’s Academy, and all mail matter intended
for the students of either institution should be addressed to
Notre Dame, Ind. There are too man}7 buildings at Notre
Dame to receive detailed notice; indeed, so numerous are they,
that if brought together, they would cover at least eight or ten
acres of ground.
Surroundings.
The University is situated about a mile and a half north of
the flourishing city of South Bend, Ind., and about eighty miles
east of Chicago. It is surrounded by a fertile and prosperous
farming country. And yet, by reason of its proximity to South
Bend, it combines the conveniences and accommodations of the
city with the salutary isolation, wholesome climate, and natural
beauties of the country. A broad avenue runs directly south
from the University for a mile or more, and on both sides
it is lined with shade trees. North and west of the
University are two beautiful . lakes — St. Joseph’s and St.
Mary’s. The area of the former is but a little less than 23 acres.
The ground slopes picturesquely down to the lakes, and beauti-
ful walks along the shores almost surround them. On the higher
ground, above the walks, and overlooking the lakes, are mag-
nificent groves of oak, hickory, sycamore and other varieties of
hard timber. St. Joseph’s River, swift of current and tortuous
of channel, sweeps grandly past the University grounds on the
west. The scenery along its steep and timber-lined banks is
bold, wild, romantic.
Accessibility.
Notre Dame occupies a position almost central with reference
to the most important cities of the Mississippi Valley. The
railroads running directly to South Bend are the Lake Shore &
Michigan Southern, the Grand Trunk, the Vandalia, and the
Michigan Central. The road last named is connected with
South Bend by a lateral line which runs south from Niles,
Mich., and passes through the University grounds. Omni-

buses and other conveyances, by which visitors can expedi-
tiously reach Notre Dame, may be found on the arrival of trains
at the stations of the roads indicated.
Discipline.
The aim of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame is
to secure for each student that quiet and to promote that mental
concentration which are absolutely .necessary to a thorough
college course. Although the rules made and enforced with this
intention are more stringent than is usual in American
Colleges, there is nothing required by them to which any earnest
student can reasonably object. Other than earnest students are
out of place in the University. It is supposed that every student,
by the mere act of matriculating, binds himself to gentlemanly
conduct while at Notre Dame. If it be discovered that he is not
worthy of a place on the list of students, the authorities reserve to
themselves the right of dropping his name from that list.
The manner of life at Notre Dame is that of a large and well-
regulated family. This necessarily involves close contact on the
part of students with one another; consequently the authorities
are obliged, in the interest of each worthy student, to enforce the
rules governing conduct with uncompromising firmness. And
yet the causes of expulsion are not more numerous than in any
well organized club of gentlemen. There can, for instance, be
no mitigation of the extremest penalty for flagrant disobedience
of authority, the use of intoxicating liquors, immorality, the
habitual use of profane or obscene language, unathorized absence
from the college limits, etc. In the case of suspension or expul-
sion, for such offenses no tuition fees will be returned.
The students in the various college halls are under the same
rules of discipline. They retire not later than ten, and the signal
for rising is given never later than 6:30. Undue attention to
athletics at the expense of studies is not permitted; while at
the same time, students are advised, expected and strongly
encouraged to take part in healthy out-door sports. Contests with
athletic organizations from the outside are, however, discouraged,
and rarely—if ever—permitted. The athletic societies are not
permitted to take part in games outside the college premises.
16	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
A competent instructor in gymnastics is retained by the Uni-
versity. Special attention is given to the improvement of the
physical condition of the students; experience shows that the
course of study and the discipline at Notre Dame have not failed
to produce sane-minded and physically healthy men. The
military drill is optional, but it is strongly recommended to
promote manly deportment and erect carriage.
While persons of all religious denominations 'participate in the
privileges of the University, it is nevertheless a strictly Catholic insti-
tution, and all students are required to attend divine services at
stated times.
Other regulations^ which time has sanctioned as salutary, may
be summarized as follows:
i. Students are required to report at the college immediately
after their arrival at the station. This rule is binding not only
at the begining of the school year, but at all other times when
leave of absence has been granted. Unnecessary delay in the
neighboring city is looked upon as a serious violation of rule.
2. Leave of absence can not be granted to students during
term time except in cases of urgent necessity. There is no
vacation at Easter. 3. No student shall leave the University
grounds without permission of the President or Vice-President,
or the person delegated to represent them. 4. No branch of
study shall be taken up or discontinued without permission of
the Director of Studies. 5. The use of tobacco is strictly for-
bidden, except to such students of Brownson or Sorin Hall as
have received from their parents written permission to use it.
6. The use of intoxicating liquors is absolutely prohibited under
all circumstances. 7. To guard against clandestine and im-
proper correspondence, the President reserves the right to
supervise letters to and from students. 8. Students are not
permitted to receive boxes containing other eatables than fruit.
GENERAL REMARKS.
A University course in education implies that the student has
had the benefit of elevating associations, as well as of careful
instruction. The desire of the authorities is to surround the

17
student with professors and companions of the highest character,
and their aim is to include no pupil on the roll of the University
who would not be received into the home of the most scrupulous.
Christian parent. The University is a town in itself, and the
student runs no risk of suffering from the dissipations of outside
society. The environment, natural, artistic, human, is of the
most elevating character. He must work, for there are no dis-
tractions permitted while he is at work; the system of discipline
is the result of deep consideration of the best means of develop-
ing conscientiousness, firmness of purpose, habits of patience
and self-relience, in a word of giving the student the best tools,
for acquiring the highest success in life.
Members of the Junior and Senior classes of any of the Colle-
giate Courses have rooms in Sorin Hall; other students are
assigned according to age to Brownson, Carroll or St. Edward’s
HalE Young men of 17 and upward are assigned to Brownson
Hall. Their dormitories, study hall, refectory, lavatories, etc.,
are in the east half of the main University building. The students
of Carroll Hall, whose ages range from 13 to 17, occupy the
west portion of it. The pupils of St. Edward’s Hall have a
building exclusively to themselves. The different Halls to which
students are thus assigned are entirety separate from one another.
Their inmates are seldom brought together except in certain
collegiate classes. The pupils of St. Edward’s Hall have no
direct intercourse with the students of the other departments.
There are ample accommodations for six hundred resident
students at the University. The ventilation is exceptionally
good. Scrupulous cleanliness prevails everywhere. The fare
is abundant in quantity, varied in quality, and always wThole-
some. The class-rooms are large and well lighted, as are also
the rooms used by the literary, debating, dramatic and other
societies.
The societies devoted more particularly to the cultivation of
music and the drama have always been very popular, and many
of their members have reached a higher degree of proficiency
than mere amateurs are commonly expected to attain. This is
largely due to the fact that they are aided and stimulated by the
i8
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
sedulous co-operation and encouragement of professors well
qualified to give instruction in music and the drama. Then,
too, there are societies especially intended to promote the inter-
ests of religion and lead to a thorough knowledge of Christian
doctrine. By means of essays and debates great readiness in
speaking, as well as felicity in the expression of thought, is
attained by many members of these societies.
The students of the different departments are under the super-
vision of their respective prefects and professors; and while
they enjoy all the freedom compatible with the requirements of
good order, they are firmly held to an observance of the cour-
tesies expected of gentlemen in their intercourse with one another.
But there is very little occasion for the exercise of rigor in this
respect, as the students come almost invariably from homes in
which they have been brought up under the salutary influence of
careful and proper training. They have been taught to observe
the manners that distinguish upright and honorable young men;
and it is an important aim of the discipline in force at Notre
Dame to make them in all respects thorough, accomplished and
carefully educated gentlemen—gentlemen whose lives will be
useful and honorable, and tend to reflect credit upon their
parents, themselves and the University.

ENGLISH COURSE.
31
English Course.
It is unnecessary to state the reasons why careful training in
the art of using the English language, both in speaking and
writing, is absolutely necessarj7. No man ignorant of the literary
masterpieces of his own language, or unable to use it Avith cor-
rectness, force and grace, is liberally educated; he is, in fact,
unfit for the practical duties of any important business or pro-
fession. The Faculty of the University have spared no pains to
make the Special English Course as thorough as possible.
The course extends over a period of four years, and those who
have completed the prescribed studies and passed the examina-
tions satisfactorily receive the degree of Bachelor of Letters.
A high standard is kept up throughout the course in all Eng-
lish branches, and the degree is conferred on no one who, besides
giving evidence of proficiency in the Classics and Science, has
not also given proof of ability to apply the principles of com-
position and shoAvn an acquaintance with the writings of the best
authors in English and American literature.
The appended scheme of the course explains itself; it is only
necessary to emphasize the following points:
[1]	From the beginning of the course to the end special attention will be paid
to paragraphing, editorial and essay writing. Each theme will be. read
and criticised in the author’s presence.
[2]	Facilities are afforded for a training in journalism by the publication,
weekly, of the Notre Dame Scholastic, a twenty-four page paper devoted
to the interests of the students, the columns of which are open to their
contributions. Every student of the course is expected, after the expira-
tion of the first year, to contribute to the Scholastic at least two articles
per session.
[3]	Students are required to be familiar with the masterpieces of the leading Eng-
lish and American authors, and they will be encouraged to read the works
of such authors during their leisure hours. They have access at all times
to a library containing a complete collection of all the English Classics.
[4]	A Graduation Thesis will be required of every student; this must show,
besides grace of style, a scholarly treatment of the theme selected.
The preparatory studies for this course are the same as those
introductory to the Classical Course, with the exception that
Greek may be replaced by one of the Modern Languages.
The Faculty have determined to spare no pains to render this
course of the utmost value and interest to the students, and to
32

encourage them to acquire a thorough familiarity with their
native language, and a facility in speaking and in composition,
which is everywhere recognized as indispensibly requisite to
success in any profession in which they may be engaged in after
life.

The English and Mathematics of the Preparatory Department
are requisite for admission into this Course. Instead of Greek
and Latin, however, French and German should be studied.
Students are advised to devote special attention to French, in
view of the valuable contributions to engineering science which
so frequently appear in French periodicals and contemporary
literature.
This course is designed to furnish the student not only a
thorough theoretical knowledge of the various branches of
engineering, but at the same time to illustrate so fully by practical
wrork the subjects theoretically treated as to enable the graduate
to enter at once intelligently upon the duties of his profession.
Instruction is given throughout the course by means of text
books and lectures. Considerable attention is given to the
solution of the problems specially prepared for the purpose of
exemplifying the principles studied and of fixing them firmly in
the mind of the student.
The school is fully equipped with all the instruments necessar}^
for effective work in the different branches of field engineering.
Among these instruments may be mentioned engineers’ transits,
plane table, Wye level, rods, tapes, chains, etc.
During the winter months, problems relating to railroad loca-
tion, computation of earth work, etc., are carefully examined.
During the spring months students handle and adjust the instru-
ments in the field, locate a short railroad—having first made the
necessary reconnoissance and preliminary surveys—make pro-
files, plans, and topographical charts, do cross-section leveling
and make the necessary estimates for the construction of the
road.
The special studies in the Engineering Course are bridge-
building, in which the various methods of computing'strains are
carefully examined, masonary construction, the strength and
resistance of materials, the theory of structure, hydraulics, land
surveying, grading, topography of land, streets, etc.
CIVIL ENGINEERING.
45
Students who have completed this course, after satisfactory
examination and on presentation of a thesis approved by the
Faculty, receive the degree of Civil Engineer.
The studies of the Freshman and Sophomore years of the
Course are the same as those of the corresponding years <d the
Scientific Course. Elementary Physics and Chemistry should,
however, be taken during the Sophomore year in the place of
English History.

BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE.
49
Course of Biological Science.
This Course leads to the Degree of Bachelor of Science in
Biology. The University has provided this special course for
students who desire to devote their time largely to biological
pursuits, either as an immediate preparation for the study of
medicine or veterinary science, or with a view to teaching, or
otherwise engaging in biological research.
The requirements for admission to this Course are the same
as those for admission to the Freshman class of the Scientific
Course. An elementary knowledge of the various branches of
Natural History is also desirable.
From the programme of studies laid down, it may be seen
that during the first two years the student is required to devote
his time to acquiring a knowledge of the elements of biological
science and of the physical sciences, which is absolutely essen-
tial to the successful prosecution of an extended course of this
nature.
History and the Languages also receive attention; as does
Drawung, without which no one can be successful at present in
the field of science.
During the last two years the student is led deeper into the
study of both the organic and inorganic worlds, and at the same
time is required to apply his knowledge. During these two
years the student is urged not merely to repeat the experiments
in Biology made by others, but every facility and encouragement
is given him to devote himself to original investigations.
Cytology, or Cellular Biology, both normal and pathological,
is an attractive feature of this Course, and one which undoubt-
edly will be a great help to the student to form a correct and
intelligible idea of the phenomena of life as exhibited by living
forms, both unicellular and multicellular.
The study of Pharmaceutical Botany will receive special atten-
tion, also Clay Modeling, a knowledge of which is of great bene-
fit to the practitioner.
50
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Some time is also devoted to Mineralogy and Geology, as no
educated man can afford at the present day to be without a
knowledge of these interesting subjects.
It is hardly necessary to add that a great part of the time
throughout the Course is spent by the students in the various
laboratories; and, moreover, private laboratories in Biology are
set aside for the more advanced students, where they can pursue
their investigations with greater facilities.

Commercial Course.
This course can be completed in two years. It includes arith-
metic, grammar, letter-writing, geography, United States history,
reading, orthography, penmanship, book-keeping, Commercial
Uaw—in other words all the branches of a complete business
education.
When the character and needs of the country—especially of
the great West in which we live—are considered, this course
will appear the most practical, and one of the most important
that an educational institution can afford.
Those, therefore, who have not the time or means to take a
complete College course, in the Classics and Sciences, would do
well to enroll themselves in the Commercial Course. No plan of
study is more injudicious than ahap-hazard selection of such studies
as an inexperienced young man may fancy. The training resulting
from a fixed course of studies is of the utmost benefit to the student.
The commercial course at Notre Dame has always received
the most careful attention from the officers and the Commercial
Faculty of the University. Notre Dame claims to give the
graduates of this course a more complete business training than
can be obtained in any purely commercial college. Believing
that a business education includes something more than a mere
knowledge of Book-keeping, and that a good education, cannot be
obtained in a few weeks, the authorities have extended this course
over two years—the shortest time in which studies necessarily
used in business life can be mastered. Should a pupil desire
during this period to pursue any other studies in which he may be
interested, and for which he has time, he will have liberty to do
so. General History and Linear Drawing are especially recom-
mended to commercial students. They also have the opportunity
of attending an elementary course of the Physical and Natural
Sciences. Many commercial students find it also to their
advantage toffiake up the study of German or French, for which
there are the amplest facilities. A talented and studious young
man may thus in the course of two years find himself in the
possession of a most valuable practical education, which will fit
him to take his place in the front rank of educated business men.

Miscellaneous.
The Department of Physical and Natural Sciences.
Notre Dame has always given special attention to the cultiva-
sion of the Physical and Natural Sciences, but during the past
few years extra efforts have been made in this direction, with a
view of affording to her students all the facilities and advantages
that may be found in the best equipped scientific schools. A
large and commodious building, in the Romanesque style, known
as “Science Hall,” has been erected for this purpose, and it is
the intention of the authorities to make it as perfect in all its
appointments as any similar institution in the country. It is
one hundred and thirty-one feet long by one hundred and four
feet deep, and proportionally high. There are upwards of
twenty-five spacious, ’well lighted and well ventilated rooms in the
building, nearly all of which are designed either as lecture rooms
or laboratories for the various branches of experimental science.
The building has been carefully planned for the purposes to
wdiich it is appropriated, and embodies in its construction all
the improvements and conveniences to be found in the most
approved scientific structures of this country and Enrope.
Special efforts have been made to render the building con-
venient for both the professor and the student.
The laboratories, lecture-rooms, and cabinets are so connected
with one another, and with the grand apartments set aside for
the museum, that specimens and apparatus are always at hand
when desired, and where they can be used. The students of
Natural History have their specimens systematically arranged
in rooms adjoining their laboratories, whilst the students of
Chemistry and Physics have their cabinets conveniently near,
and, at the same time, independent of each other, owing to the
peculiar plan of the building. The various classes can enter
the rooms and laboratories wuthout interfering in any way with
one another, and can continue their studies and experiments
without interruption. The general principles of science are
taught by lectures, and these are supplemented by practical
work in the various laboratories.
6o
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
In Chemistry and Physics the necessary apparatus is at the
disposal of the student, and he is expected to verify, by obser-
vation and experiment, what has not been experimentally illus-
trated in the lectures he has attended.
In all these departments, as well as in those of Physics and
Chemistry, special stress will be laid on practical work, and a
student’s proficiency will be estimated by his record of observa-
tion and experiment in the laboratory and workshop.
In the study of Botany, Zoology, and Physiolog)", each student
is provided with a microscope and the necessary accessories,
and most of his time is spent in microscopic study, under the
direction of the Professor.
In Geology and Mineralogy the system is the same. The
student commences work in the laboratory at once, and thus
early becomes acquainted with the various minerals, rocks,
fossils, etc. The blowpipe, microscope, polariscope and
-clinometer are in constant use to verify what has been learned
in the lecture room, and to fix it on the memory.
In the Department of Mechanical Engineering there are fully
equipped workshops, for wood and metals. Steam engines and
•dynamo-electric generators, and motors of various types and sizes
furnish the power required, and afford the student special facilities
in making experiments concerning the various forms of energy.
A Photographic Laboratory is also fitted up in the building,
where the student is enabled to learn, practically and in a short
time, the art of modern Photography, and thus prepare himself
for professional work in the studio.	•
Rooms have likewise been set aside for Assaying and Metal-
lurgy, and it is the purpose of those in charge to leave nothing
undone to make the work in this department compare favorably
with that accomplished in the others.
Additions of apparatus, specimens, and books for reference
are constantly being made to the various departments, and no
effort will be spared to make “Science Hall” a recognized centre
of thorough work in genuine practical science.
Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre
Dame to promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of
which is so necessary for business or scientific purposes.
MISCELLANEOUS.
61
The German language—the classes of which are so numerously
attended—has been taught by six instructors during the present
scholastic year. The number of students attending the German
classes is becoming greater every year. The study of French is
recommended to all students of the Collegiate Course. The
Course of Spanish will receive special attention in the future,,
and other modern languages may be taught when required.
Telegraphy and Type-Writing.
Telegraphy invites the special attention of the students of the
commercial and scientific courses; and a knowledge of Type-
Writing, which can be acquired in a short time, is useful and
valuable for all.
For the Telegraphic Department a special room is provided
and equipped with standard line instruments, including a com-
plete Wheatstone bridge set for electrical measurement. In-
struction is given by an experienced, practical operator. Each
student receives individual attention and is urged to make as
rapid progress as his ability allows. The text-book used is
Abernethy’s “Commercial and Railway Telegraphy.”
In the Type-Writing Department the machines in use are new
Remington’s, wuth the latest improvements. Thorough instruc-
tion is given in the manipulation and care of the machine, in
the correct forms of business letters, law work, essays and
general writing.
Phonography, or Short-hand,
Is of very great assistance to those in the higher classes, enabling
its possessor to take verbatim notes of lectures, etc. It is
adaptable to the English, French, German or Spanish lan-
guages. With a good English education it is a profession in
itself, and one not likely to be overcrowded for years to come.
First-class phonographers and typewriters are always sure of
employment, and pupils in both branches here find every facility
to fit them for the highest grades of practical work.
Phonography and Type-Writing have of late come into general
use in legal and commercial work—in the court, the law office,
and the counting-room, in business houses, banks, insurance
and railroad offices, etc.,— and, for first-class stenographers

especially, the demand exceeds the supply. A knowledge of
these useful arts will therefore prove a strong recommendation
for confidential and lucrative positions.
Elocution.
No educational institution in the country surpasses Notre
Dame in the facilities afforded to students for acquiring profi-
ciency in elocution. The instruction is thorough, the exercises
are practical, and the subjects of study exhibit judicious variety.
These exercises are held in St. Cecilia Hall, which is peculiarly
adapted for the purpose, being conveniently situated, large, and
elegantly furnished. The exercises constitute an important part
in the studies of young men -who strive to cultivate, with suc-
cess, literature, oratory, and the dramatic art. The approved
methods of stimulating and developing the natural elocutionary
powers are called into requisition as occasion seems to warrant.
To this end, the drama receives a due share of attention; from
time to time an appropriate tragedy or comedy is rendered by
students, on the stage of Music Hall, with all the customary
accessories and'.appointments used in connection with perform-
ances. Four public exhibitions are given during the year, and
public literary exercises are held seven times during the same
period. An oratorical contest is one of the notable features
marking the close of the year. For the purpose of encouraging
and stimulating students to put forth their best efforts, premi-
ums and gold medals are offered to those who most distinguish
themselves. When all these things are duly considered, there
need be no hesitation in repeating that “no educational institu-
tion in the country surpasses Notre Dame in the facilities offered
to students for acquiring proficiency in elocution.”
Lecture and Concert Course.
Prominent among the educational advantages, enjoyed by the
students of the University, is the course of public lectures and
.concerts, which supplement the regular class work.
It is the aim of those in charge of this course to secure the
services of leading thinkers and educators as well as the most
distinguished artists of the day.
MISCELLANEOUS.
63
Among the lecturers on special topics during the present year
have been Right Reverend Bishops Keane and Spaulding, Hon.
Henry Watterson, Rev. Dr. Canaty and Rev. Father Nugent.
Among the musical organizations which have visited the Uni-
versity, may be mentioned, The Remenyi Concert Co., The
Mendelssohn Quintette, The Boston Temple Quartette, etc.
Drawing- and Painting-.
The University, which is becoming every year more widely
and favorably known as an art center, enjoys ample facilities for
imparting instruction in these branches. It possesses a large
number of models, a fine studio, and able and zealous teachers.
Music.
This department is complete in all its appointments. It has
able Professors and is divided into classes on the regular Con-
servatory system. An Orchestra of fifteen pieces, and a Brass
Band of twenty-three instruments, are some of the leading
features of the Instrumental Music Department.
Vocal Music, to which special attention has been paid, and
which has contributed so much to the pleasure of the students
during the past few years, will receive even more careful atten-
tion in future, and it is hoped that this branch will become every
year more popular.
Reading-Booms.
The lower floor of Music Hall is divided into large and neatly
furnished Reading Rooms, for the benefit of the students of
Brownson and Carroll Halls. These reading rooms are sup-
plied with books and periodicals from the library, and students
have access to them during the hours of recreation.
The Lemonnier Library
Continues to receive contributions from liberal friends, and now
numbers over 50,000 volumes. A reading room has been opened
in connection with the library, in which the leading periodicals
of Europe and America are to be found on file. The members
of the Library Association desire to give their Alma Mater a
collection of books that can stand comparaison with those pos-
sessed by any other educational establishment in the United
States; therefore they call on the friends of the University to
assist them bj^ donations of books, pamphlets, periodicals, and
manuscripts. All contributions should be addressed to the
Librarian of the Lemonnier Library, Notre Dame University,
Notre Dame, Ind.
64
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Minim Department
For the care and training of boys under the age of thirteen
there has been established a Department to which the most
scrupulous attention has always been paid by the College author-
ities; it is known as the Minim Department, and it has always
been one of the greatest objects of interest to the Faculty as
well as to all persons visiting Notre Dame.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all the elementary
branches of an English education is here imparted, together
with a rudimentary knowledge of Latin, French, and German.
Vocal Music and Drawing form no extra charge. The pupils of
this department are taught by Sisters of the Holy Cross, under
whose maternal care they pass nearly the entire day.
Discipline.
The following is the order of the day: Rising at half-past six,
toilet, etc.; seven, breakfast, after which there is a short time
given for exercise on the Campus; half-past seven, study: half-
past nine, recreation and lunch; ten, study; a quarter to twelve,
toilet; twelve, dinner, followed by recreation; half-past one,
study; half-past three, recreation and lunch; half-past six, sup-
per and recreation; half-past eight, retiring. From this it may
be seen that while the Minims devote never less than six hours a
day to study, they are never more than two hours in succession
in the class-room. The recreation and exercise in the fresh air,
between each two hours of study, unbend the mind and prepare
the boys to return to their classes refreshed and ready for work.
The Minims are always under supervision, during the hours
of recreation, as well as in the class-room and study hall. The
presence, however, of the Prefects is far from being a restraint
on the amusement of the boys; for while it is the duty of the
Prefects to insist that their young charges shall ahvays keep
wdthin the limits of the strictest propriety, they, at the same
time, take part in all sports, organize games, and do everything
in their power to foster a love for healthful exercise. The play

grounds consist of a fine, level, five-acre field, well supplied with
turning poles, swings, ladders, rings, parallel-bars, and all other
necessary gymnastic apparatus. That the boys make good use
of them can best be seen from their healthy, happy apearance,
which invariably attracts the notice of visitors.
Connected with the play ground is a brick play-hall, 160 feet
long, heated by steam. In this hall the boys play in rainy or cold
weather.
The Sisters preside at the toilet; the}’ clean and mend the
clothing; see to all the needs and to the comfort and convenience
of the Minims. Baths are taken every Saturday. Under-
clothing is changed regularly twice a week. Great care is taken
that the boys be neatly dressed, and that the clothing be suitable
for the season.
Societies.
There are two societies in the Minim Department: that of the
Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its object to
supply servers for the Church offices: and the Sorin Association,
which has been established with a view to give the pupils a start,
as early as possible, in Elocution. The Society is presided over
by one of the Professors, -who finds it a pleasant duty to draw
out the talent of these interesting young orators. Meetings are •
held once a week, after school hours. These meeting are a
source of pleasure as well as of profit. The members prepare
original compositions, deliver declamations, are trained to debate,
etc. Only the best behaved and more advanced in studies are
admitted to membership. To encourage this young Literary
Society a Gold Medal is annually awarded at Commencement
for Elocution to the most deserving member.
General Remarks.
The discipline to which the Minims are subjected is much milder
than that which is suited to students more advanced in age.
Recourse is scarcely ever had to punishment. Those in charge
endeavor to govern by kindness and gentleness, and by appeal-
ing to the boys’ sense of honor. The names of all wdiose conduct
and application to studies are satisfactory appear under the heads

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
of Roll of Honor and Class Honors in the Scholastic, a paper pub-
lished weekly at Notre Dame. To find his name mentioned in
these rolls is found to be as great a reward for the deserving pupil,
as its non-appearance is a punishment for the undeserving.
Then, again, there is a Gold-Medal awarded at the end of two
full years to those whose deportment has been unexceptionable
during that period. As this fact is made known to the Minim
immediate!}’ after his entrance, he generally endeavors to shape
his conduct with a view to receiving an “Honor.” The greatest
care is taken to form their young hearts to habits of virtue, and
to inculcate the practice of refined manners. Ever}’ effort is
made to foster respect and affection for parents, to whom they
are expected to write, at least, once a week.
Not the least of the advantages enjoyed by the Minims is their
complete separation from the larger students. An elegant and
commodious building, known as St. Edward’s Hall, affording
ample accommodations forever one hundred pupils, is devoted to
their use. It is four stories in height, one hundred and fifty feet
long, and forty-five feet wide; heated by steam, supplied through-
out with the Edison incandescent electric! light, and provided
with hot and cold water. The ceilings in the Study Hall, Class
Rooms, and sleeping apartments are fifteen feet high. The
windows are large and numerous, affording abundant light and
ventilation. The Study Hall commands a charming view from
each of its eleven large windows. It is tastefully decorated with
statuary, pictures, choice plants, beautiful flower caskets, etc.
Besides the pleasure the Minims derive from studying in this
bright, cheerful hall, their habits and tastes are cultured by
coming into contact with objects so refining. Fronting the
building is a handsome park, which, with its sparkling fountain,
rare trees and flowers, adds not a little to the beauty of St.
Edward’s Hall, as well as to the happiness of its inmates.
These remarks, which-have been made to satisfy parents and
others, who frequently write for more detailed information, will
show that, while the Minims have every possible advantage to
aid them in acquiring a good, solid education, they have also a
most happy home where they enjoy the same ease and freedom
that they would enjoy under the care of their mothers.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Sorin Hall.
SORIN HALL is a commodious building recently erected for
the use of advanced students. It is situated a short distance
southwest of the church. Facing east, it is on a line wdth Science
Hall, from which it is separated by an extensive green sward and
a beautiful grove. It is a three-story and basement building, and
presents a very attractive appearance. In its construction special
attention wras paid to sanitary conditions, and every apartment
and hall is well lighted and ventilated. During the day sunshine
visits every room in the building. All the recent improvements in
architecture were considered and discriminatingly introduced in
constructing and completing Sorin Hall and arranging its interior
with reference to the convenience of the inmates. It contains a
large number of rooms for the use of students, besides several
apartments intended for other purposes. Each of the students’
rooms is supplied with a 16-candle electric light, and is heated by
steam in cold weather. This building has its own furnace and
heating aparatus and its own dynamo or electric-light plant. All
its arrangements are suggestive of the conveniences and comforts
of a home.
The basement is divided into a reading-room, where the student
finds all the late magazines, both American and foreign; a large
apartment designed for recreation purposes at suitable times,
bath-rooms, etc.
On the first floor, at either side of the main entrance, are two
suites of elegant rooms for offices and chambers. The large
apartment at the north end of the building is used as a chapel,
and here the students assemble morning and evening for prayer.
The Law Department, with its library, lecture-room, moot-court
room, etc., is at the south end.
The second and third floors are uniform in arrangement and
similar in appearance. Here are the rooms that the students
occupy. All of them are regularly numbered and neatly furnished;
and there is not one of them that does not command an extended
and beautiful view. They serve as chambers for the young men

at night and as study rooms during the day. Each room has only
one occupant. Thus it is sought to insure a proper and profit-
able use of time by all. This same consideration has led the
College authorities to prohibit the inmates of Sorin Hall from
calling on one another or visiting the rooms of others. While not
at class, nor at meals, nor engaged in taking necessary recreation
upon the campus, students are supposed to be at work in their
rooms, although at suitable times thejT ma)r meet in the reading
room or recreation apartment. This building is intended for
earnest and well-disposed students who desire to make the best
possible use of their time; and the rules prescribed for its inmates
are practically in harmony with the regular standard of living to
which young men of that class seek to conform. For these the
rules will be found very simple and easy of observance. For
others there can be no relaxation of them. The penalty for the
violation of any of them consists in the forfeiture by the offender
of his room and the privileges of Sorin Hall. Where the offence
is gross the forfeiture is permanent; but where relieved by
mitigating circumstances, it may be only temporary.
The rules governing students at Sorin Hall are found liberal
enough by all who earnestly desire to work, to be manly and
honorable, to be temperate and industrious, to be pure in speech
and above reproach in conduct. But for such as do not seek to
conform to that standard [in the general tenor of their lives, or
do not endeavor to square their actions in accordance with it, the
discipline will soon be found sufficiently stringent to prevent
their remaining as inmates of the building.
The advanced students referred -to as entitled to quarters at
Sorin Hall comprise young men of the Senior and Junior years in
the classical, scientific or any other regular course of the university
curriculum. When a student has attained to that rank in educa-
tional proficiency, whether he has studied here or elsewhere, he
is entitled without extra charge to a room and to the privileges of
Sorin Hall. There he may remain until he finishes, or as long
afterwards as he wishes, should he desire to pursue post-gradute
studies. The same rule applies to students of the Junior and
Senior year, or to post-graduates, who desire to study law.

three years. However, when students are entitled to advanced

may enable them to complete the- course. And so where they
have studied a year or two in other law schools. While it is
desirable that three years should be given to the prosecution of
legal studies before seeking admission to the bar, yet persons who
attend all the lectures and exercises of the course and diligently
apply themselves to the discharge of the duties devolving upon
them may finish in two years.
The regular course comprises three years. The student in it
must be at least 17 years of age. He must have a fair general
education and be able accurately to write the English language.
A preliminary examination may be resorted to as a means of
ascertaining his educational standing. Once he has been admitted
to the course he may attend at his option any of the collegiate
classes.
The other course comprises a period of two years. The
standard of qualifications for graduation is practically the same
in both courses. The shorter course is designed more particularly
for the accommodation of students who have reached or passed
the age of 18 years and acquired a good general education.
Students of this course must apply themselves chiefly to the
study of law. A proper performance of the duties devolving upon
them leaves but little time for other studies.
With the exception of collegiate graduates, whose general ed-
ucation is presumably finished, all young men about to enter upon
the stud}^ of law should endeavor to take the three years’ course.
Knowing how comprehensive the study of law is, and how
available all branches of human knowledge may be made in its
practice, the officers of the University aim to afford law students
special advantages—all reasonable and approved facilities—in
the work of qualifying themselves for the legal profession. Con-
sequently students of the Law Department may, without additional
expense, enter the classes and pursue the studies of the classical
and scientific courses. They may study the natural and physical
sciences, civil and mechanical engineering, mathematics, survey-
ing, rhetoric, literature, elocution, logic, philosophy, ancient
and modern languages, and the like, in connection with the law.
In these classes they have the same privileges and are subject to
the same rules as the other students.

No extra expense m thereby entailed. However, such students
nni't be f-ufimicnt)y advanced in age and education to justify the
belief that they can understand and appreciate instruction in the
iaw. The number of students of this class is likely to increase
steadily, for year by year it is becoming more and more manifest
that an education in our time is not complete without a knowledge
of at least the elementary principles of the law. Many a business
man has had to face financial ruin on account of wrant of acquaint-
ance with the law. Many a person has by an inconsiderate act
due to his ignorance of the law forfeited claim to the protection
of the court and the vindications of his rights. Many a person
has been compelled to do exactly the contrary of what he intended
through his failure to understand the essential elements of a
contract. Many a one has been compelled to pay heavy damages
for personal injuries caused by negligence, or failure to perform
a duty, or improper performance of it, where no liability would
exist if the “law of torts” had been known and observed. As
the law is over and around every creature from the first moment
of his being until the grave has closed upon him, it would be
impossible to over-estimate its utility and importance. Indeed,
there is no study that can at all compare with it in practical
utility, in training the mind to accuracy of observation, in
strengthening the judgment and directing it to intelligent dis-
krimination in the whole wide range of secular affairs. Without
LAW DEPARTMENT.
a knowledge of at least the elementary principles of the law
■education in our day can hardly be pronounced complete.
Tlie Chief Methods of Insteuction
in the Law Department consist in the delivery daily of three lec-
tures, the taking of copious notes of the same by the students, the
subsequent reading by them of the decisions cited in the notes,
the study of the standard elementary text-books, the analysis and
recitation in substance at least of the most important leading cases,
oral examinations daily and written examinations weekly, the trial
of actions at law and suits in equity in the Moot-Court, debates
and exercises in public speaking at least once a week. One of the
professors presides as judge of the Moot-Court and chairman of
the society meetings. The Moot-Court is regularly organized,
having the necessary officers, such as a judge, clerk, prosecuting
attorney, sheriff, bailiff, reporters, etc. Pleadings are filed and
actions or suits begun in as close accordance as possible with
the practice of the county, State and Federal courts.
Four classes are taught daily. Three hours are devoted to the
lectures, while one hour is given to “quizzing” and recitations.
Wednesday and Saturday evenings are devoted to society and
Moot-Court proceedings. Students take full notes of the lectures.
These cover the whole domain of the law and state principles
pithily and intelligibly. Thejr state what seem to be the correct
or established rules and avoid the contradictions that perplex so
many students. They are deemed highly valuable not only in
preparing for examination, but also in subsequent practice, as the
latest decisions are often found cited in them. In the “quiz”
class it is sought by question and answer to cover the whole ground
of the law. Questions bearing upon every branch and phase of
it are put to the students during the two or three years of their
course, and almost necessarily they become familiar not only with
them, but also with the proper answers. Hence, the ground is
■covered, ist, by the lectures; 2d, by the study of the notes and
the reading and analysis of important decisions; 3d, by the study
of the best elementary text-books, lists of which can be had from
•the professor; 4th, by daily examinations or “quizzes.” These
74	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
£k quizzes ” are exceptionally instructive and interesting. They
are conducted orally—in conversational style. They are not con-
ducted with a view to puzzling or confusing the students. On
the contrary, the aim is to make everything clear and intelligible
to them. Moreover, they are invited to ask the examiner for
information upon any and every topic that may seem in any way
'obscure to them. At certain times adjudicated cases of special
importance are analyzed and explained. The rise, organiza-
tion and development of courts likewise receives due attention.
The common law and code methods of beginning an action, filing
the pleadings, joining issue, impaneling the jury, examining
witnesses, applying the rules of evidence, preparing instructions,
receiving the verdict, moving for a new trial, arguing the motion
for it. taking the case to the higher courts on appeal, preparing
the record, abstract and brief, and doing all things necessary in
the management of a trial, are fully described and exemplified.
Matters that could not profitably be treated at length in the
lectures, with the requisite variety of illustrations and qualifica-
tions, are taken up and considered at “quiz. ” Hypothetical cases
involving the principles that students find it most difficult to
master are frequently submitted, analyzed and explained. The
questions and answers cover all the most important principles
stated in the notes, but the range of the “quiz” is broader in
certain directions than the notes. Nothing is overlooked which
ma}’ legitimately be made the subject of a question in the examina-
tion for admission to the bar. It is evidently due in no small
measure to this fact that the graduates of this Department have
been so exceptionally successful in their examinations. Certain
it is that no law school in the country has a more creditable
record than Notre Dame in that regard. However, the Supreme
Court of Indiana has adopted a rule providing for the admission
of graduates of this Department on motion, or without examina-
tion. Under this rule they may present themselves before the
court and receive certificates of admission to the bar. They
are likewise admitted on motion to the bar of the Federal courts.
It is required, however, that applicants for admission to the bar
of this State shall be voters.
LAW DEPARTMENT.
75
Tlie Common Law
is taught primarily at Notre Dame. That is the law generally
prevalent throughout the Union. It addresses itself to almost
all the relations of life. In fact, about nineteen out of every
twenty cases tried in our courts are decided in accordance with its
principles. It is generally uniform in its operation. However,
the statutory enactments of State Legislatures overcome and dis-
place it so far as they conflict with it. These enactments differ
materially in different States, owing to unlike conditions and local
differences. Thus it is that the laws of certain States are so
radically unlike the laws of other States. Of course, there are
instances in which statutes are passed to cover acts and condi-
tions not provided for by the common law; but in most instances
the existing statutes qualify, displace or render inoperative some
rules of the common law. The repeal of statutes having this
effect restores the common law rules to their former force and
efficacy. In view of these facts, thorough instruction is here
given in the common law. Neither lawyers not judges pretend
to know the statutes of any other State than that in which they
practice or preside. Moreover, no court pretends to take judicial
cognizance of or know the statutes of any other State than that
in which it has its being and jurisdiction, In fact a knowledge
of the statutes of different States would be more confusing and
bewildering than profitable to judge, lawyer and student. In an
examination for admission to the bar in any State in the Union
no question is put and nothing is said relative to the statutes of
any other State. There are, however, certain fundamental
statutory enactments that exist without material diversity in their
scope and purpose in almost all the States. Again, other statutes
somewhat less important and fundamental in character exist in
groups of States. Such statutes as these may profitably be
studied in class, in connection with the common law, but it would
be worse than useless for a student to attempt to investigate and
study the mazes of statutory differences in the several States.
Hence it is recommended as advisable for each student to bring
with him when he comes here in September to pursue the study
of law a copy of the revised statutes of his own State or of the
State in which he proposes to practice.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
In the Matter of Expense,
no discrimination is made between law students and the students
of the regular collegiate courses. The fee for board, lodging,
tuition, washing, the mending of linens, etc., is fixed at $300.00
for the scholastic year. Terms of payment and other informa-
tion will be found under the head of expenses, page 19.
Isolated as Notre Dame is, students enjoy immunity from the
distractions and temptations of city life and need incur no note-
worthy expenses aside from those stated. They live in an atmos-
phere of study, and every incentive and feeling of emulation
aroused in them tends to the formation of studious habits. Thus
their work is rendered peculiarly effective. It has often been dem-
onstrated that nowhere else do students accomplish more work
in a given time. This fact is not to be overlooked in considering
the matter of expense. In order to maintain this salutary state
of things the same rules of discipline apply to all students.
Access may be had at reasonable hours, not only to the Lemon-
nier Library, but also to the Lawr Library. This contains all
the standard text books and reports. Every decision rendered
for several years in the State, Territorial and Federal courts may
be found in the Law Library. Consequently students need pur-
chase but very few lawT books. In this regard they are specialty
favored, for at other law schools the item of books alone for
each student frequently amounts to from $100 to $300.
Young men eligible to begin the study of law may be matric-
ulated as students of this Department at any time during the
year. They are charged only from the date of entrance. How-
ever, it is advisable to enter at or near the beginning of the
scholastic year. Students in the graduating year are known as
Seniors. The others are called Juniors. All law students,
whether Seniors or Juniors, whose general education is suffi-
ciently advanced to place them on a footing with students in
the Senior or Junior class in the collegiate course, are entitled
to free rooms in Sorin Hall.
A Post-Graduate Course
for law students has recently been established. Graduates may
return at any time and enter upon the studies of this course.
LAW DEPARTMENT.
77
By devoting a year to the work prescribed and passing the
examination they become entitled to the degree of Master of
Laws. They are entitled to rooms free of charge and have all
the rights and privileges of other post-graduates. The course of
instruction consists mainly in the analytical study and writing of
pleadings, the examination of witnesses, the taking of depositions,
the trial of actions at law and suits in equity, the practical appli-
cation of rules of evidence, the preparation of briefs and
arguments for the higher courts, the study of leading cases,
practice from time to time in what is popularly called “office
work,” daily participation in the exercises of the ‘‘quiz class,”
a comparative study of the legislation of different countries, and
the influence of the civil law upon the development of modern
jurisprudence. It is believed that the student who finishes this
course and reads carefully the revised statutes of his State will
be qualified to enter at once upon the practice of law.
Every student who is a candidate for the degree of Bachelor
of Laws and Master of Laws is required to write, at least six
weeks before graduation
A Thesis
upon some legal topic selected by himself. It should not be
less than 40 folios in length. The writer is expected to read the
thesis at a special meeting of the class and to defend the propo-
sitions set forth in it. Having read and defended it success-
fully,’ he places it in the hands of the Dean of the Faculty,
whose approval it must have. If it be not meritorious in matter,
form and style, the student may forfeit the right to be considered
a candidate for graduation until the following year and the
submission by him of a satisfactory thesis.
In Conclusion
it may be stated that nowhere can the study of law be more
profitably pursued than at Notre Dame. The diligent student
may here qualify himself to pass the most rigid examination in
any State. He may lay broad and deep the foundation of his
legal knowledge and fit himself to become notable in the pro-
fession and worthy of its honors.
78
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Students here have a decided advantage over those of some
other law schools, in that they are not so numerous as to make
the Law Class unwieldy and cumbersome. It is hardly noticed in
some places who does and who does not attend class, and the
relative standing of students is often quite unknown to the
professors. So numerous are the}’ that the books of even a vast
library would be inadequate for their use. A score of them may
desire to refer to and read the same book at the same time.
Taking moot-court cases in turn, they can hardly try before the
professors more than one or two in the year. They may not be
required to answer each on an average more than one question
a week. They receive little or no practical instruction. Left
almost wholly to themselves in the choice of methods of study,
it is not remarkable that there should be an absence of system
in the work they do, nor is it singular that many of them utterly
fail to make substantial progress. Such evils almost inevitably
attend the work of instructing a very large class. Moreover, a
large corps of professors would be requisite in such case. And
who does not know that the larger the corps of professors, the
more difficult for them to act in unison, to avoid repetition, to
cover the law in its entiretyr, to understand readily and work
effectively to overcome the peculiar weaknesses and drawbacks
of each student ?
Law students at Notre Dame have none of these evils to con-
tend against. Here each member of the class comes frequently
in contact with the professors and becomes known to them. He
is directed and aided in his work. He is required to attend class .
regularly and to obey in his deportment and the discharge of his
duties certain prescribed rules of discipline—rules of discipline
deemed necessary for his welfare. Thus he may be strengthened
at every weak point. Thus he may be rounded out into
symmetrical and useful manhood. Thus may his character be
formed in the mold of honor and impressed with the noble traits
and admirable qualities of gentleman, scholar and lawyer.
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.	79
Institute of Technology.
This building has been erected on the most approved plans,
after a study of the best institutions of the kind at home and
abroad. In size it is 109 feet long by 40 feet wide and three
stories high. Convenience, ventilation, and an abundance of
light are provided for in all the rooms.
The Institute is divided into three principal departments: that
of Theoretical and Experimental Engineering, the department
of Practical Mechanics, and the department of Machine Drawing
and Design.
1	.—Engineering Department.
This department is divided into two principal sections; that
of the class-room or Theoretical Engineering, and that of the
Mechanical Laboratory or Experimental Engineering.
(1)	Section of Theoretical Engineering.—The course of
studies in the class-room during the Junior year comprises the
subjects of Materials of Construction, Kinematics or Mechanical
Movements, and the principles of Machine Design.
These principles are illustrated by models in the lecture-room
and further explained in the drawing-room.
The Senior year is devoted to the study, by text-book and
lecture, of Thermodynamics, the Theory of the Steam Engine
and other motors, the construction and operation of boilers and
pumps. A graduating thesis and drawing, and a specimen of
shopwork are required of each candidate for a degree at the
close of the year.
(2)	Section of Experimental Engineering.—This depart-
ment is devoted to calorimetry and the standardization of instru-
ments; the adjusting and operation of prime movers, boilers and
pumps, with precise measurements of their power and efficiency;
the testing of the strength and properties of the materials of
construction, the metals, woods, oils, etc. The purpose of this
8o
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
course is not only to familiarize the student with the apparatus
employed but to teach him some of the methods of research and
prepare him for the prosecution of original investigations.
II	.—Department of Practical Mechanics.
This department is divided into two sections: Wood-working
and Machine-shop Work.
(i)	Section oe Wood-working.—This section comprises three
courses: ist, the course in Joinery, in which the student is
taught the use and care of hand tools, the making of joints and
parts of structures, and the best methods of laying off and
executing the most familiar operations of the joiner and carpen-
ter: 2d, the course of Wood-Turning, in which he learns the use
of the lathe and acquires a fair degree of skill in working to
measurement: 3d, the course of Pattern Making, which is a
combination of the other two for mechanical purposes. The
machine tools used in this course, besides the lathes, are the
scroll saw, the planer, the saw bench, and universal trimmer.
(2)	Section of Machine-Shop Work.—The exercises of this
course are graded and principally designed to illustrate the use
of the tools. The tools employed are the lathe, planer and
shaper, drill press, milling-machine, grinding apparatus, etc.,
such as are most commonly met in general practice.
III	.—Department of Machine Drawing and Design.
Instruction in this course begins with free-hand sketching of
the parts of machines some of which may afterwards be made to
scale. Linear drawing and the use of instruments follow; and
the principles of descriptive geometry are taught until the
student can work with certainty and precision. Students in the
courses of kinematics and machine design study on the drawing-
board more fully the details of mechanisms and the relations of
connected parts. This is done under the direction of the
instructors of those branches, who also assists in thesis work
and the designing of complete machines. Tracing, blue-print-
ing, coloring, and the conventionalities of drawing are practiced
extensively.
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.	8 I
Special Courses.
Those who do not take the course of Engineering may, if
recommended by the Director of Studies, enter the shops for a
■course in manual training or for the purpose of acquiring skill
in practical mechanics.
Course in Applied Electricity.
A practical and experimental course in applied Electricity has
been arranged for students in Electrical Engineering.
Other students, having available time and proper attainments,
who desire practical knowledge of the modern applications of
Electricity may enter this class.
The laboratory exercises will be similar to those contained in
Ayrton’s Practical Electricity, Slingo and Brooker’s Electrical
Engineering, Kempe’s Electrical Testing and Thompson’s
Dynamo-Electric Machinery. Recitations and careful notes of
all work performed will be required.
The equipment and conveniences provided for this course are
very complete and well-selected. Four rooms having a floor
space of over 3,000 square feet in the basement of Science Hall
are used for a testing laboratory, a construction and experi-
mental work-shop, a battery and photometer room and a
dynamo and engine room. These are an addition and auxiliary
to the cabinets, laboratories and lecture room of the general
physics department. The appliances comprise numerous forms
of batteries, direct and alternate current dynamos and motors,
arc and incandescent lighting apparatus, and a large collection
of the latest types of American and foreign scientific and com-
mercial instruments for current strength, E. M. F., resistance,
insulation, capacity, efficiency and photometer tests and meas-
urements. The University of Notre Dame was one of the first
in the United States to be lighted by electricity. The plant
consists of three Edison dynamos for indoor lighting and a
Thomson-Houston arc light dynamo for illuminating the
grounds. In the eight buildings where the incandescent light
has been introduced there are over twelve miles of wiring. This
affords opportunity for practical inspection and testing.

Arcliconfraternity of tlie Immaculate Heart of Mary.
This pious Association is affiliated to the Archcoilfraternity of
the Sacred and Immaculate Heart of Mary, established in the
Church of our Lady of Victories, in Paris. Its primary object
is to pray for the conversion of sinners and persons in error.
It aims at the mutual edification and personal sanctification of
all its members by regular weekly religious exercises, monthly
communions, and other religious practices. The Archconfra-
ternity is the oldest society in the University, and recruits its
members from amongst the Catholic students of Brownson and
Sorin Halls. It was canonically established at Notre Dame by
the Very Rev. Father Sorin, in 1845, and bids fair to be in the
future, as it has been in the past, for the students of Notre
Dame, a source of many blessings from the hands of their
Patroness, the Immaculate Mother of God.
Owing to the greatly increased membership the associates
are divided into four branches.

Society of the Holy Childhood.
The primary object of the Society of the Holy Childhood, of
which this society forms a part, is to offer an opportunity to
children throughout the world to contribute their share towards
the redemption of pagan children from the darkness of heathenism.
The monthly contributions are small, but the aggregate is con-
siderable, while thousands of children are by this means trained
up to habits of charity.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC.
THE “ NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC ”
Is the title of a neat 24-page paper, devoted to the interests of
the students, and is published at the University every week
during Term time. This journal opens a field for young writers
who might otherwise, for want of a proper medium, allow their
talents to remain inactive.
The Scholastic contains articles of an instructive literary
character, interesting Biographical sketches, Essays, Poetry,
Notes on Art, Music, Science and Literature, Notes of New
Publications, etc., etc.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic has a
special importance for students, their parents, and all who have
attended classes at the Uuniversity in times past, on account of
the weekly summary of events transpiring at Notre Dame, per-
sonal notices of former students, Rolls of Honor, Class Hon-
ors, List of Excellence, etc., which appear in its columns every
week. Reports relative to the arrangement of classes, the pro-
motion of the more talented and energetic students, etc., also
find a place in this paper, and keep parents and o’thers informed
on all that concerns their children and friends.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the coming
year to merit the encouragement given the paper in the past,
and the encomiums bestowed upon it by the press in general.
