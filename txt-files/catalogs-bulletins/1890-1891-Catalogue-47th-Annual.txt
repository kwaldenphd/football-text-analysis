Notre Dame University.
Historical.
W||HE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME has by degrees
| reached its present rank and standing among the educational
41 institutions of the country. It was founded in the year 184=2
by the Very Reverend Edward Sorin, now Superior Greneral of the
Congregation of the Holy Cross; in 184=4= it was chartered by the
Greneral Assembly of the State of Indiana. It grew rapidly from
a small frontier school to a fairly equipped college, and at length
assumed the proportions of a University. On April 23, 1879, five |
of the college buildings were destroyed by fire. The loss included
the library, museums, and scientific apparatus. The progress of
the University, however, was arrested but for a short time. In
September, 1879, some of the colleges had been rebuilt, and the
beginning of the present extended group of buildings had been made.
The new order of things fulfilled a hope rather than a promise of the
old, and the Notre Dame of to-day, with its complete equipment, its i
standard of studies, and its increasing influence, more than realizes
the most sanguine expectations even of those who had the firmest
belief in the possibilities of higher education in the West. A brief
review of the
Material Eqipment of the University
seems not inappropriate.
Maik Buildikg. This is five stories high; its dimensions are
320 x 155 feet. The distance from the ground to the electric light
just above the statue surmounting the dome is 207 feet. This
building contains museums, the libraries, art galleries, class-rooms,
study halls, dormitories, lavatories, refectories, etc. On the first
floor are the refectories, lavatories, trunk-rooms, armories, etc.
The refectories are richly ornamented with mural paintings, repre-
senting many of the most celebrated Ecclesiastical and Secular
buildings in the world, and beautifully illustrating the progress of
architecture. The lavatories are supplied with hot and cold water,

;	and have all the customary accommodations. The armories con-	i
!	tain about 150 stand of arms, with bayonets, accoutrements, etc.	।
!	These arms were procured from the State, for the service of mem-	i
!	bers of the military organizations. The reception parlors, and	1
;	offices of the President, Secretaries, and Prefect of Discipline are on	|
;	the main floor, as are also the study-halls, several	of the class-	;
.	rooms, the telegraph office, and the students’ office.	This floor is	j
{	tiled and the corridor is lined with a series of superb	mural paint-
;	ings (the work of the distinguished Roman artist,	Signor Luigi	,j
; Gregori), which illustrate the leading events in the life of Colum-
: bus, or, more particularly, such of them as history associates with
i the discovery of America. Portraits of distinguished eccclesiastics,
! including almost all the Catholic Bishops in the United States,
; those living as well as those who have gone to their reward, line
the walls of the corridors on the floor above, and it is appropriately i
called the “Bishops’ Gallery.” The society-rooms are on the same I
floor, as are also some of the class-rooms; they are tastefully orna-
mented with paintings, mural decorations, and busts of noted
personages. Two large dormitories are likewise on this floor.
j The Lemonnier Library and Memorial Hall are on the third floor,
i Two large dormitories, that correspond in size and appearance to
‘ those below, occupy the rest of the floor. The music-rooms of the
vocal classes and the Department of Drawing take up the greater
part of the fourth floor. The Lemonnier Library contains 32,000
volumes, besides miscellaneous objects of interest gathered from
all parts of the United States, and many other countries. Three
wide oaken staircases afford communication between the different
floors from the first story to the top of the building; and these,
supplemented by exits to the roofs of verandas and porticoes, with
ample means of descending safely to the ground, remove all danger
of personal injury in case of fire. But the fullest precautions have
been taken to guard against that peril. With a watchman
constantly on duty, water on each floor and hose at hand, there is
absolutely no danger of fire. The halls throughout the building
are wide, high, and spacious. The many angles which distinguish
the building were planned and constructed in accordance with the
prevailing style of architecture at Notre Dame, which is known as
modern Gothic. These angles serve to give strength and solidity
PROSPECTUS.	I I
i to the entire building, rendering it secure against the fury of the :
wind and storm, not to mention the incidental advantages of good ;
light and perfect ventilation which they afford. Just east of the
Main Building is	;
Music Hall. This is 170 feet in length by 100 in width, and ■'
over 100 in height. The first floor is divided into recreation and !
। reading rooms, the north end being for the students of Carroll '
Hall, and the south for the students of Brownson Hall. These j
rooms are supplied with newspapers, periodicals, games of all kinds, ;
billiard-tables, etc. The dressing rooms of the Bicycle Club and '
of the Athletic Association are also on this floor. The second and
third floors at the north end are divided into music-rooms, and
instrumental music of all kinds is there taught. The Exhibition ;
Hall occupies the remainder of the building. In it are given the ;
more formal lectures, as well as concerts and dramatic entertain-
ments. Fully furnished with the scenes, accessories and decora-	i
tions appropriate to such uses, and capable of accommodating 1,200	'
persons, it ranks as one of the largest and most attractive college ;
halls in the country.	.
Science Hall. This imposing edifice is situated a few steps ।
south of the Music Hall. The dimensions are 101 x 131 feet, and j
the height is three stories, or 75 feet. It is divided into two j
departments, and supplied with all the agencies requisite to facili- ।
tate the acquisition of a complete knowledge of the sciences. The
laboratories, lecture-rooms, museums, biological department,
engine-rooms, etc., are admirably arranged for the convenience of
students. The Hall is fully equipped with all necessary chemicals,
preparations, specimens, charts, tools, instruments, and the
innumerable accessories of a great school of science. It is said to
be one of the largest buildings devoted exclusively to scientific
studies in the United States, and its merits, we trust, will entitle it
to rank among the best. The Brownson Hall campus op play-
ground, a level tract containing about ten acres, lies south-east of
it. South of it is the
Institute oe Technology, a large and commodious building '
devoted to the exclusive use of the students of civil, mechanical
and electrical engineering. It is fully equipped with all the
appliances for wood and metal working, and is supplied with the
12	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
most approved forms of forges and cupolas for blacksmithing
and foundry work. The rooms for mechanical drawing, and the
laboratories for special experimental work in mechanical engineer-
ing, were specially designed for the purpose for which they are used,
; and are complete in all their appointments. North-east of this is
. The Gymnasium, which measures 160 feet in length and 45 in
! width, and is two stories in height. It is abundantly supplied
with swings, turning-poles, horizontal bars, and other apparatus
calculated to inspire a taste for gymnastic exercises. The north
half is for the use of the students of Carroll Hall, whose campus
surrounds it, while the south half is set apart for the students of
j Brownson Hall. Just north of the Gymnasium and Music Hall is
। St. Edward's Park; and fronting this, facing south, is	j
! St. Edward’s Hall, a building four stories high, and 155 feet
' in length, by 50 in width. This is for the exclusive use of pupils
i under thirteen years of age. It is entirely separate from the
i University, though under the same general management. The
i building is new, and lacks none of the appointments suggested by j
experience as useful or desirable. It is divided into study-halls, ;
class-rooms, dormitories, etc. The recreation hall is just eist of it, I
while farther east and north lies the play-ground. The pupils are
under the immediate direction of competent and experienced teach-
ers—Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.
The Infirmary adjoins St. Edward’s Hall on the west. In
dimensions it is 100 x 45 feet, and three stories high. The General
Office occupies a portion of the first floor. The rooms on the floor
above are kept in readiness for the reception of students who at
any time are prevented through illness from attending classes and
discharging their customary duties. The regular physician of the
University, and the Sisters in charge minister to the sick in all
cases.
The Church stands a little west and south of the main build-
ing. It is generally regarded as one of the most beautifully
decorated churches in the country. In size it is 275x120 feet, and
the distance from the ground to the apex of the roof is about 125
feet. It is richly ornamented with paintings and statuary, and
hours may profitably be given to the examination and study of
hese and the multitudinous objects of interest and beauty in which
PROSPECTUS.

it abounds. In its tower is the largest bell in the United States.
Besides, there are 32 smaller bells in the tower. These vary in
size and constitute the noted “chimes of Notre Dame.’’ South and
west of the Church stands
Sorik Hall. The style of the building is what is currently
called mixed Gothic and Homan. The height from the ground to
apex is about 70 feet. It has a measurement of 144 feet along its
front, or from north to south, while in depth, or from east to west,
it will measure, when completed, 112 feet. The basement, about
two-thirds of which is over the ground level, has a height of 9 feet
from floor to ceiling. Above the basement the structure rises to
the altitude of three stories. The distance from the first floor to
the ceiling is 15 feet; from the second floor to the ceiling, 13 feet,
and from the third floor to ceiling, about 12 feet. Two wide and
substantial staircases afford ample means of passing readily from
floor to floor. The basement is sub-divided into lavatories, bath-
rooms, boiler and engine rooms, etc. The building is heated
throughout by an automatic self-feeding apparatus placed in the
basement. On the first floor are two or more of the principal
offices, a chapel, law lecture room, moot-court room, law library,
society rooms, etc. A large room in the north part of the building
serves as a chapel, while the law rooms are south of the entrance,
with an east and south exposure. The second and third floors are
almost exclusively appropriated for students’ rooms. The building
is commodious, thoroughly ventilated, and the rooms and corridors
are well lighted, and comfortably heated at all times.
A regularly established United States post-office is situated on
the University grounds, a short distance from the main building.
It is particularly intended for the accommodation of the University
and St. Mary’s Academy. But there are too many buildings at
Notre Dame to receive detailed notice. Indeed so numerous are
they, that, if brought together, they would cover at least four or
five acres of ground.
Surroundings.
The University is situated about a mile and a half north of the
flourishing city of South Bend, Ind., and about eighty miles east
of Chicago. It is surrounded by a fertile and prosperous farming
country. And yet, by reason of its proximity to South Bend, it

14	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
combines the conveniences and accommodations of the city with
• the salutary isolation, wholesome climate, and natural beauties
of the country. A broad avenue runs directly south from the i
University for a mile or more, and on both sides for half the dis- j
tance, it is lined with shade trees. North and west of the Univer- |
i sity are two beautiful lakes—St. Joseph’s and St. Mary's. The
area of the former is but a little less than 23 acres. The ground
slopes picturesquely down to the lakes, and beautiful walks along
the shores almost surround them. On the higher ground, above
the walks, and overlooking the lakes, are magnificent groves of
oak, hickory, sycamore, and other varieties of hard timber. St.
{ Joseph’s River, swift of current and tortuous of channel, sweeps
| grandly past the University grounds on the west. The scenery
! along its steep and timber-lined banks is bold, wild, romantic.
Accessibility.
Notre Dame occupies a position almost central with reference
to the most important cities of the Mississippi Valley. The rail-
roads running directly to South Bend are the Lake Shore and
Michigan Southern, the Grand Trunk, the Vandalia and the
Michigan Central. The road last named is connected with South
Bend by a lateral line which runs south from Niles, Mich., and
passes through the University grounds. Omnibuses and other
conveyances, by which visitors can expeditiously reach Notre
Dame, may be found on the arrival of trains at the stations of the
roads indicated.
Discipline.
The aim of the authorities of the University of Notre Dame is
to secure for each student that quiet and to promote that mental
concentration which are absolute necessities in a thorough college
course. Although the rules made and enforced with this intention
have more of a military character than is usual in American Col-
leges, there is nothing required by them to which any earnest stu-
dent can reasonably object. Other than earnest students are out
of place in the University. It is supposed that every student, by
the mere act of matriculating, binds himself to gentlemanly con-
duct while at Notre Dame. If it be discovered that he is not
worthy of a place on the list of students, the authorities reserve to
PROSPECTUS.
15

themselves the right of dropping his name from that list. In the
case of such suspension or expulsion, no tuition fees will be
returned.
The manner of life at Notre Dame is that of a large and well-
regulated family. This necessarily involves close contact on the
part of students with one another; consequently, the authorities
are obliged, in the interest of each worthy student, to enforce the
rules governing conduct with uncompromising firmness. And yet
the causes of expulsion are not more numerous than in any well-
organized club of gentlemen. There can, for instance, benomiti- I
gation of the extremes! penalty for flagrant disobedience of
authority, the use of intoxicating liquors, immorality, etc.
The students in the various college halls are under the same
rules of discipline. They retire not later than ten, and the signal
for rising is given never later than 6:30. Undue attention to ath-
letics at the expense of studies is not permitted; while at the same
time, students are advised, expected and strongly encouraged to
take part in healthy out-door sports. Contests with athletic organ-
izations from the outside are, however, discouraged, and rarely—if
ever—permitted. A competent instructor in gymnastics is retained
by the University. Special attention is given to the improvement
of the physical condition of the students; experience shows that
the course of study and the discipline at Notre Dame have not failed
to produce sane-minded and physically healthy men. The military
drill is optional, but it is strongly recommended to promote manly
deportment and erect carriage.
While persons of all religious denominations are admitted to
participation in the privileges of the University, it is nevertheless a
strictly Catholic institution, and all students are required to attend
divine services at stated times.
Other regulations, which time has sanctioned as salutary, may
be summarized as follows: 1. No branch of study shall be taken
up or discontinued without permission of the Director of Studies.
2. No student shall leave the University grounds without permis-
sion of the President or Vice-President, or the person delegated
to represent them. 3. The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden,
except to such students of the Senior department as receive from
i
I
j 16	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
i
[ their parents written permission to use it. 4. The use of intoxicat-
I ing liquors is absolutely prohibited under all circumstances. 5. To
j guard against clandestine and improper correspondence, the Presi-
| dent reserves the right to supervise letters to and from students.
GENERAL REMARKS.
! A University course in education implies that the student has had
j the benefit of elevating associations, as well as of careful instruc-
J tion. The desire of the authorities is to surround the student with
I
। professors and companions of the highest character, and their aim
> is to include no pupil on the list of the University who would not
’ be received into the home of the most scrupulous Christian parent.
!	The University is a town in itself, and the student runs no risk of
i	suffering from the dissipations of outside society. The environ-
i ment, natural, artistic, human, is of the most elevating character.
! He must work, for there are no distractions permitted while he is
! at work; the system of discipline is the result of deep consideration
of the best means of developing conscientiousness, firmness of pur-
pose, habits of patience and self-reliance,—in a word of giving the
student the best tools for the acquiring of the highest success in
life.
Members of the Junior and Senior classes of any of the Col-
legiate Courses have rooms in Sorin Hall; other students are
assigned according to age to Brownson, Carroll or St. Edward’s
Hall. Young men of 17 and upward are assigned to Brownson
Hall. Their domitories, study hall, refectory, lavatories, etc., are
in the east half of the main University building. The students of
Carroll Hall, whose ages range from 13 to 17, occupy the west
portion of it. The pupils of St. Edward’s Hall have a building
exclusively to themselves. The different Halls to which students
are thus assigned are entirely separate from one another. Their
inmates are seldom brought together except in certain collegiate
classes. The pupils of St. Edward’s Hall have no direct intercourse
with the students of the other departments.
There are ample accommodations for six hundred resident stu-

in quantity, varied in quality, and always wholesome. The class-
rooms are large and well lighted, as are also the rooms used by the
literary, debating, dramatic, and other societies.
The societies devoted more particularly to the cultivation of 1
music and the drama have always been very popular, and many of
their members have reached a higher degree of proficiency than
mere amateurs are commonly expected to attain. This is largely
due to the fact that they are aided and stimulated by the sedulous
co-operation and encouragement of professors well qualified to j
give instruction in music and the drama. Then, too, there are !
societies specially intended to promote the interests of religion and i
lead to a thorough knowledge of Christian doctrine. By means of
essays and debates great readiness in speaking, as well as felicity
in the expression of thought, is attained by many members of
these societies.
The students of the different departments are under the super- ‘
vision of their respective prefects and professors; and while they i
enjoy all the freedom compatible with the requirements of good
order, they are firmly held to an observance of the courtesies
expected of gentlemen in their intercourse with one another. But '
there is very little occasion for the exercise of rigor in this respect, i
as the students come almost invariably from homes in which they ;
have been brought up under the salutary influence of careful and j
proper training. They have been taught to observe the manners !
that distinguish upright and honorable young men; and it is an i
important aim of the disipline in force at Notre Dame to make
them in all respects thorough, accomplished and carefully educated
gentlemen—gentlemen whose lives will be useful and honorable, i
and tend to reflect credit upon their parents, themselves and the
University.

ENGLISH COURSE.

ENGLISH COURSE
It is unnecessary to state the reasons why careful training in
the art of using the English language, both in speaking and writ-
ing, is absolutely necessary. No man ignorant of the literary
masterpieces of his own language, or unable to use it with correct-
ness, force, and grace, is liberally educated; he is, in fact, unfit for
the practical duties of any important business or profession. The
Faculty of the University have spared no pains to make the Special
English Course as thorough as possible.
The course extends over a period of four years, and those who
have completed the prescribed studies and passed the examinations
satisfactorily receive the degree of Bachelor of Letters.
A high standard is kept up throughout the course in all English
branches, and the degree is conferred on no one who, besides giving
evidence of proficiency in the Classics and Science, has not also
given proof of ability to apply the principles of composition and
shown an acquaintance with the writings of the best authors in
English and American literature.
The appended scheme of the course explains itself; it is only
necessary to emphasize the following points:
fl] From the beginning of the course to the end special attention will be
paid to paragraphing, editorial, and essay writing. Each theme ■will
be read and criticised in the author’s presence.
[2]	Facilities are afforded for a training in journalism by the publication,
weekly, of the Notre Dame Scholastic, a twenty-four page paper
devoted to the interests of the students, the columns of which are
open to their contributions. Every student of the course is expected,
after the expiration of the first year, to contribute to the Scholastic
at least two articles per session.
[3]	A familiarity is required with the masterpieces of the leading English
and American authors, and students will be encouraged to read the
works of such authors during their leisure hours. They have access
at all times to a library containing a complete collection of all the
English Classics.
[4]	A Graduation Thesis will be required of every student; this must show,
besides grace of style, a scholarly treatment of the theme selected.
The preparatory studies for this course are the same as those
introductory to the Classical Course, with the exception that
Greek may be replaced by one of the Modern Languages.
The Faculty have determined to spare no pains-to render this


30	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
course of the utmost value and interest to the students, and to
encourage them to acquire a thorough familiarity with their native
language, and a facility in speaking and in composition, which is
everywhere recognized as an indispensible requisite for success in
any profession in which they may be engaged in after life.
The programme of studies is as follows:

The English and Mathematics of the Preparatory Department
are requisite for admission into this Course. Instead of Greek and
Latin, however, French and German should be studied. Students
are advised to devote special attention to French, in view of the [
valuable contributions to engineering science which continually I
appear im French periodicals and contemporary literature. The
usual course, as laid down in its proper place, having been followed |
through the Preparatory and Freshman years, this course will be I
supplemented, during the Sophomore and Junior years, by tech- I
nical readings in works of acknowledged merit among Engineers. I
In French, Rondelet, Chomienne, Lagrene, and other authors will	I
be read, with selections from current numbers of the Annates des	I
Ponts et Chaussees and the Revue Scientifigue. In German, current I
numbers of the Zeitschrift fur Eisenbahnen und Dampfschiffahrt, I
of Glaser's Annaten, and of the Mittheilungen aus den Gebiete des	I
Seewesens, with extracts from Huber, Kreuter and Von Benko,	I
will form the class exercises.	I
A course of drawing is also begun in the preparatory years, as
this is an art in which the future Civil Engineer can hardly have I
too much practice.
The studies of the Freshman and Sophomore years of the
Course are the same as through the same years of the Scientific
Course. Elementary Physics and Chemistry should, however, be
taken during the Sophomore year in the place of English Flistory.
The studies of the last two years of the Course are as follows:

Goursc in Biological Science.
This Course leads to the Degree of Bachelor of Science hi
Biology. The University has provided this special course for
students who desire to devote their time largely to biological pur-
suits, either as an immediate preparation for the study of medicine,
veterinary science or with a view to teaching, or otherwise engaging
in biological research.
The requirements for admission to this Course are the same as
the requirements for admission to the Freshman class of the
Scientific Course. An elementary knowledge of the various
branches of Natural History is also desirable.
From the programme of studies laid down it may be seen that
during the first two years the student is required to devote his time
towards acquiring a knowledge of the elements of biological science
and of the physical sciences, which are absolutely essential to the
successful prosecution of an extended course of this nature.
History and the Languages also receive necessary attention; as
: does Drawing, without which no one can be successful at present
in the field of science.
I During the last two years the student is led deeper into the study
of both the organic and inorganic worlds, and at the same time is
required to apply his knowledge. During these two years the
student is urged not merely to repeat for himself the researches in
Biology made by others, but every facility and encouragement is
given him to devote himself to original investigations.
Cytology, or Cellular Biology, both normal and pathological, is
an attractive feature of this Course, and one which undoubtedly
will be a great help to the student to form a correct and intelligible
idea of the phenomena of life as exhibited by both unicellular and
multicellular forms of life.
The study of Pharmaceutical Botany will receive special atten-
tion, also Clay Modeling, a knowledge of which is of great benefit
to the practitioner.


BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE.	47
Some time is also devoted to Mineralogy and Geology, as no
educated man can afford nowadays to be without a knowledge of
these interesting subjects.
Finally, it will be unnecessary to say that a great part of the time
throughout the Course is spent by the student in the various
laboratories; and, moreover, private laboratories in Biology are set
aside for the more advanced students, where they can pursue their
investigations with greater facilities.

Gommerclal course.
This course can be completed in two years; it includes arithme-
tic, grammar, letter-writing, geography, United States history,
reading, orthography, penmanship, book-keeping, and Commercial
Law—in other words all the branches of a complete business edu-
cation.	.
Considering the character and needs of the country—especially
of the great West in which we live—this course is the most prac-
tical, and one of the most important that an educational institu-
tion can afford.
Those, therefore, who have not the time or means to take a com-
plete College course, in the Classics and Sciences, would do well to
enroll themselves in the Commercial Course. No plan of study is
more injudicious than a hap-hazard selection oE such studies as an
inexperienced young man may fancy. The training resulting from
a fixed course oE studies is oE the utmost benefit to the student.
The commercial course at Notre Dame has always received the
most careful attention from the officers and the Commercial Faculty
of the University. Notre Dame claims to give the graduates of
this course a more complete business training than can be obtained
in any purely commercial college. Believing that a business edu-
cation includes something more than a mere knowledge of Book-
keeping, and that a good education cannot be had in a few weeks,
the authorities have extended this course over two years—the short-
est time in which studies necessarily used in business life can be mas-
tered. Should a pupil desire during this period to pursue any other
studies in which he may be interested, and for which he has time,
he will have liberty to do so. General History and Linear Draw-
ing are especially recommended to students of this course. They
also have the opportunity of attending an elementary course of the
Physical and Natural Sciences. Many commercial students find it
also to their advantage to take up the study of German or French,
for which there are the amplest facilities. A talented and studious
young man may thus in the course of two years find himself in the
possession of a most valuable practical education, which will fit
him to take his place in the front rank of educated business men.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Miscellaneous.
i The Department of Physical and Natural Sciences.
; Notre Dame lias always given special attention to the cultivation
I of the Physical and Natural Sciences, but during the past few
< years extra efforts have been made in this direction, with a view
{ of affording to her students all the facilities and advantages that
I may be found in the best equipped scientific schools. A large and
। commodious building, in the Romanesque style, known as “Science
I Hall," has been erected for this purpose, and it is the intention of
! the authorities to make it as perfect in all its appointments as any
similar institution in the country. It is one hundred and thirty
one feet long by one hundred and four feet deep, and proportionally
high. There are upwards of twenty-five spacious, well lighted and
well ventilated rooms in the building, nearly all of which are
designed either as lecture rooms or laboratories for the various
branches of experimental science.
The building has been carefully planned for the purposes to
wThich it is appropriated, and embodies in its construction all tlie
improvements and conveniences to be found in the most approved
scientific structures of this country and Europe.
Special attention has been given to make the building convenient
both for the professor and student. The laboratories, lecture-
rooms, and cabinets are so connected with one another, and with
the grand apartments set aside for the museum, that specimens and
apparatus are always at hand when desired, and where they can be
used. The students of Natural History have their specimens
systematically arranged in rooms adjoining their laboratories, whilst
the students of Chemistry and Physics have their cabinets con-
veniently near, and, at the same time, independent of each other,
owing to the peculiar plan of the building. The various classes
can enter the rooms and laboratories without interfering in any
way with one another, and can continue their studies and experi-
ments without interruption. The general principles of science are
taught by lectures, and these are supplemented by practical work
in the various laboratories.
MISCELLANEOUS.	55
I In Chemistry and Physics the necessary apparatus are at the dis-
posal of the student, and he is expected to verify, by observation
and experiment, what has not been experimentally illustrated in
the lectures he has attended.
In all these departments, as well as in those of Physics and
Chemistry, special stress will be laid on practical work, and a
student’s proficiency will be estimated by his record of observation
and experiment in the laboratory and workshop.
In the study of Botany, Zoology, and Physiology, each student
is provided with a microscope and the necessary accessories, And
most of his time is spent in microscopic study, under the direction
of the Professor.
In Geology and Mineralogy the system is the same. The student
commences work in the laboratory at once, and thus early becomes
acquainted with the various minerals, rocks, fossils, etc. The
blowpipe, microscope, polariscope and clinometer are in constant
use to verify what has been learned in the lecture room, and to fix
it on the memory.
In the Department of Mechanical Engineering there are fully
I equipped workshops, for wood and metals. Steam engines and
dynamo-electric generators, and motors of various types and sizes
furnish the power required, and afford the student special facilities
in making experiments concerning the various forms of energy.
A Photographic Laboratory is also fitted up in the building,
where the student is enabled to learn, practically and in a short
time, the art of modern Photography, and thus prepare himself for
professional work in the studio.
Rooms have likewise been set aside for Assaying and Metallurgy,
and it is the purpose of those in charge to leave nothing undone to
make the work in this department compare favorably with that
accomplished in the others.
Additions of apparatus, specimens, and books for reference are
constantly being made to the various departments, and no effort
will be spared to make “Science Half’ a recognized centre of
thorough work in genuine practical science.
^Languages.
It is the desire of the authorities of the University of Notre
Dame to promote the study of the foreign languages, the use of
which is so necessary for business or scientific purposes.
56	UNIVERSITY (IF NOTRE DAME.
The German language—the classes of which are so numerously
attended—has been taught by five instructors during the past
scholastic year. The number of students attending the German
classes is becoming greater every year. The study of French is
recommended to all students of the Collegiate Course. The Course
of Spanish will receive special attention in the future, and other
modern languages may be taught when required.
Telegraphy and Type-Writing.
Telegraphy invites the special attention of the students of the
commercial and scientific courses; and a knowledge of Type-writing,
which can be acquired in a short time, is useful and valuable for all.
For the Telegraphic Department a special room is provided and
equipped with standard line instruments, including a complete
Wheatstone bridge set for electrical measurement. Instruction is
given by an experienced, practical operator. Each student receives
individual attention and is urged to make as rapid progress as his
ability allows. The text-book used is Superintendent Abernethy’s
uCommercial and Railway Telegraphy.”
In the Type-writing Department the machines in use are new
Remingtons, with the latest improvements. Thorough instruction
is given in the manipulation and care of the machine, in the cor-
rect forms of business letters, law work, essays and general writing.
Phonography, or Short-hand,
is of very great assistance to those in the higher classes, enabling its
possessor to take verbatim notes of lectures, etc. It is adaptable to
the English, French, German or Spanish languages. With a good
English education it is a profession in itself, and one not likely to be
overcrowded for years to come. First-class phonographers and
typewriters are always sure of employment, and pupils in both
branches here find every facility to fit them for the highest grades
z of practical work.
Phonography and Type-writing have of late come into general use
in legal and commercial work—in the court, the law office, and the
counting-room, in business houses, banks, insurance and railroad
offices, etc.,—and, for first-class stenographers especially, the
demand exceeds the supply. A knowledge of these useful arts will
therefore prove a strong recommandation for confidential and
lucrative positions.
MISCELLANEOUS.	57
Elocution.
No educational institution in the country surpasses Notre Dame in
the facilities afforded to students for acquiring proficiency in
elocution. The instruction is thorough, the exercises are practical,
and the subjects of study exhibit judicious variety. These exercises |
are held in St. Cecilia Hall, which is peculiarly adapted for the
purpose, being eligibly situated, large, and elegantly furnished.
The exercises constitute an important part in the studies of young
men who strive to cultivate, with success, literature, oratory, and the
dramatic art. The approved methods of stimulating and developing
the natural elocutionary powers are called into requisition as occasion
seems to warrant. To this end the drama receives a due share of
attention; from time to time an appropriate tragedy or comedy is
rendered by students, on the stage of Music Hall, with all the cus-
tomary accessories and appointments used in connection with
performances. Four public exhibitions are given during the year,
and public literary exercises are held seven times during the same
period. An oratorical contest is one of the notable features marking
the close of the year. For the purpose of encouraging and stimu-
lating students to put forth their best efforts, premiums and gold
medals are offered to those who most distinguish themselves. When
all these things are duly considered, there need be no hesitation in
repeating that “no educational institution in the country surpasses
Notre Danie in the facilities offered to students for acquiring
proficiency in elocution.11
Drawing and Painting.
The University, which is becoming every year more widely and
favorably known as an art center, enjoys ample facilities for impart-
ing instruction in these branches. It possesses a large number of
models, a fine studio, and able and zealous teachers. The eminent
artist Signor Luigi Gregori, of Rome, is still in charge of this
department.
Music.
This department is complete in all its appointments. It has able
Professors and is divided into classes on the regular Conservatory
system. An Orchestra of fifteen pieces, an excellent Quartette, and
a Brass Band of twenty-five instruments, are some of the leading
features of the Instrumental Music Department.

i
i Vocal Music, to which special attention has been paid, and which
। has contributed so much to the pleasure of the students during the
- past few years, will receive even more careful attention in future,
; and it is hoped that this branch will become every year more popular.
:	Reading-Rooms.
! The lower floor of Music Hall is divided into large and neatly
: furnished Reading Rooms, for the benefit of the students of Brownson
: and Carroll Halls. These reading rooms are supplied with books
I and periodicals from the library, and students have access to them
during the hours of recreation.
The Lemonnier library
; continues to receive contributions from liberal friends, and now
। numbers over 32,000 volumes. A reading room has been opened in
; connection with the library, in which the leading periodicals of
; Europe and America are to be found on file. The members of the
' Library Association desire to give their Alma Mater a collection of
। books which can stand comparison with those possessed by any
• other educational establishment in the United States; therefore they
[ call on the friends of the University to assist them by donations of
Ii books, pamphlets, periodicals, and manuscripts. All contributions
! should be addressed to the Librarian of the Lemonnier Library,

MINIM DEPARTMENT.
Minim Dcuartmem.
For the care and training of boys under the age of thirteen
there has been established a Department to which the most
scrupulous attention has always been paid by the College author-
ities; it is known as the Minim Department, and it has always
been one of the greatest objects of interest to the Faculty as well
as to all persons visiting Notre Dame.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all the elementary
branches of an English education is here imparted, together with
a rudimentary knowledge of Latin, French, and Grerman. Vocal
Music and Drawing form no extra charge. The pupils of this
department are taught by Sisters of the Holy Cross, under whose
maternal care they pass nearly the entire day.
Discipline.
The following is the order of the day: Rising at half-past six;
toilet, etc.; seven, breakfast, after which there is a short time given
for exercise on the Campus; half-past seven, study; half-past nine,
recreation and lunch; ten, study; a quarter totwelve,toilet; twelve,
dinner, followed byrecreation; half-past one, study; half-past three,
recreation and lunch; half-past six, supper and recreation; half-
past eight, retiring. From this it may be seen that while the
Minims devote never less than six hours a day to study, they are
never more than two hours in succession in the class room. The
recreation and exercise in the fresh air, between each two hours of
study, unbend the mind and prepare the boys to return to their
classes refreshed and ready for work.
The Minims are always under supervision, during the hours of
recreation, as well as in the class-room and study-hall. The
presence, however, of the Prefects is far from being a restraint on
the amusement of the boys; for while it is the duty of the Prefects
to insist that their young charges shall always keep within the
limits of the strictest propriety, they, at the same time, take part
in all sports, organize games, and do everything in their power to
foster a love of healthful exercise. The play grounds consist of a
fine level five-acre field, well supplied with turning poles, swings,
wnwr ra
........ nnmr m if । fit nrmT

, ladders, rings, parallel-bars, and all other necessary gymnastic
’ apparatus. That the boys make good use of them can best be seen
from their healthy, happy appearances, which invariably attracts
the notice of visitors.
। Connected with the play ground is a fine brick play-hall, 160
feet long, heated by steam. There the boys play in rainy or cold
i weather.	’
1 The Sisters preside at the toilet; they clean and mend the cloth-
ing; see to all the needs and to the comfort and convenience of the
! Minims. Baths are taken every Saturday. Underclothing is
{ changed regularly twice a week. Great care is taken that the boys
j be neatly dressed, and that the clothing be suitable for the season.
Societies.
There are two societies in the Minim Department: that of the
i Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its object to
; supply servers for the Church offices; and the Sorin Association,
Ii which has been established with a view to give the pupils a start,
as early as possible, in Elocution. The Society is in charge of one
of the Professors, who finds it a pleasant duty to draw out the
talent of these interesting young orators. Meetings are held once
a week, after school hours. These meetings are a source of pleasure
i as well as of profit. The members prepare original compositions,
j deliver declamations, are trained to debate, etc. Only the best
t behaved and more advanced in studies are admitted to membership.
To encourage this young Literary Society a Gold Medal is annually
awarded at Commencement for Elocution to the most deserving
I	O
member.
General Remarks.
The discipline to which the Minims are subjected is much milder
than that which is suited to students more advanced in age,
[ . . &
Recourse is scarcely ever had to punishment. Those in charge
endeavor to govern by kindness and gentleness, and by appealing
to the hoys’ sense of honor. The names of all whose conduct and
application to studies are satisfactory appear under the heads of
Roll of Honor and Class Honors in the Scholastic, a paper pub-
lished weekly at Notre Dame. To find his name mentioned in
these rolls is found to be as great a reward for the deserving pupil,
as its non-appearance is a punishment for the undeserving.
MINIM DEPARTMENT.	61
Then, again, there is a Gold Medal awarded at the end of two full
years to those whose deportment has been unexceptionable during
that period. As this fact is made known to the Minin immediately
after his entrance, he generally endeavors to shape his conduct with
a view to receiving an “Honor.” The greatest care is taken to
form their young hearts to habits of virtue, and to inculcate the
practice of refined, manners. Every effort is made to foster respect
and affection for parents, to whom they are expected to write, at
least, once a week.
Not the least of the advantages enjoyed by the Minims is their
complete separation from the larger students. An elegant and
commodious building, known as St. Edward’s Hall, affording
ample accommodations for over one hundred pupils, is devoted to
their use. It is four stories in height, one hundred and fifty feet
long, and forty-five feet wide; heated by steam, supplied throughout
with the Edison incandescent electric light, and provided with hot
and cold water. The ceilings in the Study Hall, Class Rooms, and
sleeping apartments are fifteen feet high. The windows are large
and numerous, affording abundant light and ventilation. The
Study Hall commands a charming view from each of its
eleven large windows. It is tastefully decorated with statuary,
pictures, choice plants, beautiful flower caskets, etc. Besides
the pleasure the Minims derive from studying in this bright, cheer-
ful hall, their habits and tastes are cultured by coming into contact
with such refining objects. Fronting the building is a handsome
park, which, with its sparkling fountain, rare trees and flowers,
adds not a little to the beauty of St. Edward's Hall, as well as to
the happiness of its inmates.
These remarks, which have been made to satisfy parents and
others, who frequently write for more detailed information, will
show that, while the Minims have every possible advantage to aid
them in acquiring a good, solid education, they have also a most
happy home where they enjoy the same ease and freedom that
they would enjoy under the care of their mothers.

Archcoiifraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
This pious Association is affiliated to the Arch confraternity of
the Sacred and Immaculate Heart of Mary, established in the
Church of Our Lady of Victories, in Paris. Its primary object is
to pray for the conversion of sinners and persons in error. It aims
at the mutual edification and personal sanctification of all its mem-
bers by regular weekly religious exercises, monthly communions,
and other religious practices. The Archcoiifraternity is the oldest
society in the University, and recruits its members from amongst
the Catholic students of Brownson and Sorin Halls, It was can-
onically established at Notre Danie by the Very Rev. Father Sorin,
in 1845, and bids fair to be in the future, as it has been in the past,
for the students of Notre Dame, a source of many blessings from
the hands of their Patroness, the Immaculate Mother of God.

ATHLETIC.
The Hoynes Light Guards.
This battalion has within the past two or three years attained to
a degree of proficiency in military tactics that entitles it to a high
rank among the cadet military organizations of the Northwest.
It is armed with “three-click'” Springfield rifles of the latest pattern,
and supplied with all the requisite accoutrements of light infantry.
It comprises three companies, and has a total membership of about
125. These companies are recruited from Brownson, Carroll and
Sorin Halls. All the members are tastefully uniformed, and have
a soldierly appearance and bearing. Their proficiency in the use
of arms has long been a subject of general remark and compliment.
They are taught the maneuvers, manual of arms, and all the
ordinary evolutions described in “Upton’s United States Tactics.”
In what is technically known as the school of the soldier and the
school of the company they are instructed by their captains,
lieutenants, and non-commissioned officers, while in battalion and
regimental drill they come more immediately under the command
of the colonel. Enlistment is altogether voluntary. No student
need become a member unless he desires to do so. However, the
authorities of the University duly encourage such organizations on
account of the salutary physical exercise they afford, the respect
for wholesome discipline they tend to promote, and the manly
bearing they serve to assure and establish.

SORIN HALL.	87
Sorin Hall.
SORIN HALL is a commodious building recently erected for
the use of advanced students. It is situated a short distance
southwest of the church. Facing east, it is on a line with
Science Hall, from which it is separated by an extensive green
sward and a beautiful grove. It is a three-story and basement
building, and presents a very attractive appearance. In its con-
struction special attention was paid to sanitary conditions, and
every apartment and hall is well lighted and ventilated. During
the day sunshine visits every room in the building. All the recent
improvements in architecture were considered and discriminatingly
introduced in constructing and completing Sorin Hall and arrang-
ing its interior with reference to the convenience of the inmates.
It contains a large number of rooms for the use of students, besides
several apartments intended for other purposes. Each of the
students1 rooms is supplied with a 16-candle electric light, and is
heated by steam in cold weather. This building has its own furnace
and heating apparatus and its own dynamo or electric-light plant.
All its arrangements are suggestive of the conveniences and
comforts of a home.
The basement is divided into a reading-room, where the student
finds all the late magazines, both American and foreign; a large
apartment designed for recreation purposes at suitable times; a
room for the furnace, coal, etc; also bath-rooms, toilet-rooms, and
the like.
On the first floor, at either side of the main entrance, are two
suites of elegant rooms for offices and chambers. The large
apartment at the north end of the building is used as a chapel, and
here the students assemble morning and evening for prayer. The
I Law Department, with its library, lecture-room, moot-court room,
etc., is at the south end.
The second and third floors are uniform in arrangement and
similar in appearance. Here are the rooms that the students
occupy. All of them are regularly numbered and neatly furnished;
88	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
and there is not one of them that does not command an extended
and beautiful view. They serve as chambers for the young men
at night and study rooms during the day. Each room has only
one occupant. Thus it is sought to insure a proper and profitable
use of time by all. This same consideration has led the College
authorities to prohibit the inmates of Sorin Hall from calling on
[ one another or visiting the rooms of others. While not at class,
; nor at meals, nor engaged in taking necessary recreation upon the
j campus, students are supposed to be at work in their rooms, although
i at suitable times they may meet in the reading room or recreation
apartment. This building is intended for earnest and well-disposed
students who desire to make the best possible use of their time;
t and the rules prescribed for its inmates are practically in harmony
| with the regular standard of living to which young men of that
j class seek to conform. For these the rules will be found very
simple and easy of observance. For others there can be no relaxa-
tion of them. The penalty for the violation of any of them
consists in the forfeiture by the offender of his room and the
। privileges of Sorin Hall. Where the offence is gross the forfeiture
I is permanent; but where relieved by mitigating circumstances, it
may be only temporary.
The rules governing students at Sorin Hall are found liberal
enough by all who earnestly desire to work, to be manly and
honorable, to be temperate and industrious to be pure in speech
and above reproach in conduct. But for such as do not seek to
conform to that standard in the general tenor of their lives, or do
not endeavor to square their actions in accordance with it, the
discipline will soon be found sufficiently stringent to prevent their
remaining as inmates of the building.
The advanced students referred to as entitled to quarters at Sorin
Hall comprise young men of the Senior and Junior years in the
classical, scientific or any other regular course of a university
curriculum. When a student has attained to that rank in educa-
tional proficiency, whether he has studied here or elsewhere, he is
entitled without extra charge to a room and the privileges of Sorin
Hall. There he may remain until he finishes, or as long afterward
as he wishes, should he desire to pursue post-graduate studies. The
same rule applies to students of the Junior and Senior year, or to
post-graduates, who desire to study law.

The course of study in this Department covers a period of three
years. However, where students are entitled to advanced standing
by reason of previous study, or have been actually engaged in the
practice of law, one or two years of faithful work may enable
them to complete the course. And so where they have studied a
year or two in other law schools. While it is desirable that three
years should be given to the prosecution of legal studies before
seeking admission to the bar, yet persons who attend all the lectures
and exercises of the course and diligently apply themselves to the
discharge of the duties devolving upon them may finish in two
years.
The regular course comprises three years. The student in it
must be at least 17 years of age. He must have a fair general
education and be able accurately to write the English language.
90	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
A preliminary examination may be resorted to as a means of ascer-	|
taining his educational standing. Once he has been admitted	j
to the course he may attend at his option any of the collegiate
classes.
The other course comprises a period of two years. The standard
of qualifications for graduation is practically the same in both
courses. The shorter course is designed more particularly for the
accommodation of students who have reached or passed the age of
18 years and acquired a good general education. Students of this
course must apply themselves chiefly to the study of law. A
proper performance of the duties devolving upon them leaves
but little time for other studies.
With the exception of collegiate graduates, whose general edu-
cation is presumably finished, all young men about to enter upon
the study of law should endeavor to take the three years’ course.
Knowing how comprehensive the study of law is, and how
available all branches of human knowledge may be made in its
practice, the officers of the University aim to afford law students
special advantages—all reasonable and approved facilities—in the
work of qualifying themselves for the legal profession. Conse-
quently students of the Law Department may, without additional
expense, enter the classes and pursue the studies of the classical
and scientific courses.. They may study the natural and physical !
sciences, civil and mechanical engineering, mathematics, surveying
rhetoric, literature, elocution, logic, philosophy, ancient and modern
languages, and the like, in connection with the law. In these
classes they have the same privileges and are subject to the same
rules as the other students.
It has been demonstrated that students of the sophomore or
junior year in the classical and scientific courses may enter with
advantage upon the study of. law, attending daily at least one of
the lectures. In such instances students have been able to qualify
themselves for graduation and admission to the bar in from three
to four years. In other words, they have been able to finish the
law either contemporaneously with their graduation in the col-
legiate course or within a year afterward.
Students who do not intend to practice law or become candidates
for the degree of LL. B., but wish simply to complete their educa-

tion by adding to their acquirements a knowledge of legal prin-
ciples, may at any proper time during the year have their names
enrolled upon the list of students in the Law Department. No
extra expense is thereby entailed. However, such students must
be sufficiently advanced in age and education to justify the belief
that they can understand and appreciate instruction in the law.
The number of students of this class is likely to increase steadily,
for year by year it is becoming more and more manifest that an
education in our time is not complete without a knowledge of at
least the elementary principles of the law. Many a business man
has had to face financial ruin on account of want of acquaintance
with the law. Many a person has by an inconsiderate act due to
his ingorance of the law forfeited claim to the protection of the
court and the vindications of his rights. Many a person has been
compelled to do exactly the contrary of what he intended through
his failure to understand the essential elements of a contract.
Many a one has been compelled to pay heavy damages for per-
sonal injuries caused by negligence, or failure to perform a duty,
or improper performance of it, where no liability would exist if
the “law of torts’’ had been known and observed. As the law is
over and around every creature from the first moment of his being
until the grave has closed upon him, it would be impossible to
overestimate its utility and importance, Indeed, there is no study
that can at all compare with it in practical utility, in training the
mind to accuracy of observation, in strengthening the judgment

and directing it to intelligent discrimination in the
range of secular affairs. Without a knowledge of
elementary principles of the law education in our day
be pronounced complete.
Tlie Chief Methods of Instruction

can hardly
in the Law Department consist in the delivery daily of two
lectures, the taking of copious notes of the same by the students,
the subsequent reading by them of the decisions cited in the notes,
the study of the standard elementary text-books, the analysis and
recitation in substance at least of the most important leading cases,
oral examinations daily and written examinations weekly, the trial
of actions at law and suits in equity in the Moot-Court, debates
and exercises in public speaking at leastmnce a we^k. One of the

professors presides as judge of the Moot-Court and chairman of
the society meetings. The Moot-Court is regularly organized,
having the necessary officers, such as judge, clerk, prosecuting
attorney, sheriff, bailiff, reporters, etc. Pleadings are filed and
actions or suits begun in as close accordance as possible with the
practice of the county, State and Federal courts.
Three classes are taught daily. Two hours are devoted to the
lectures, while one hour is given to “quizzing” and recitations.
Wednesday and Saturday evenings are devoted to society and
Moot-Court proceedings. Students take full notes of the lectures.
These cover the whole domain of the law and state principles
pithily and intelligibly. They state what seem to be the correct
or established rules and avoid the contradictions that perplex so
many students. They are deemed highly valuable not only in
preparing for examination, but also in subsequent practice, as the
latest decisions are often found cited in them. In the “quiz” class
it is sought by question and answer to cover the whole ground of
the law. Questions bearing upon every branch and phase of it
are put to the students during the two or three years of their
course, and almost necessarily they become familiar not only with
them, but also with the proper answers. Hence the ground is
covered, 1st, by the lectures. 2d, by the study of the notes and the
reading and analysis of important decisions; 3d, by the study
of the best elementary text-books, lists of which may be had from
the professor; 4th, by daily examinations or “quizzes.” These
“quizzes” are exceptionally instructive and interesting. They are
conducted orally—in conversational style. They are not conducted
with a view to puzzling or confusing the students. On the
contrary, the aim is to make everything clear and intelligible to
them. Moreover, they are invited to ask the examiner foi
information upon any and every topic that may seem in any way
obscure to them. At certain times adjudicated cases of special
importance are analyzed and explained. The rise, or organization
and development of courts likewise received due attention. The
common law and code methods of beginning an action, filing the
pleadings, joining issue, impaneling the jury, examining witneses,
applying the rules of evidence, preparing instructions, receiving
the verdict, moving for a new trial, arguing the motion for it,
LAW DEPARTMENT.	93
taking the case to the higher courts on appeal, preparing the record,
abstract and brief, and doing all things necessary in the manage-
ment of a trial, are fully described and exemplified. Matters
that could not profitably be treated at length in the lectures, with
the requisite variety of illustrations and qualifications, are taken up
and considered at “ quiz.” Hypothetical cases involving the
principles that students find it most difficult to master are
frequently submitted, analyzed and explained. The questions
and answers cover all the most important principles stated
in the notes, but the range of the “quiz” is broader in
certain directions than the notes. Nothing is overlooked which
may legitimately be made the subject of a question in the exami-
nation for admission to the bar. It is evidently due in no small
measure to this fact that the graduates of this Department have
been so exceptionally successful in their examinations. Certain it
is that no law school in the country has a more creditable record
than Notre Dame in that regard. However, the Supreme Court
of Indiana has adopted a rule providing for the admission of grad-
uates of this Department on motion, or without examination.
Under this rule they may present themselves before the court and
receive certificates of admission to the bar. They are likewise
admitted on motion to the bar of the Federal courts. It is required,
however, that applicants for admission to the bar in this State
shall be voters.
The Common Law
is taught primarily at Notre Dame. That is the law generally
prevalent throughout the Union. It addresses itself to almost all
the relations of life. In fact, about 19 out of every 20 cases tried
in our courts are decided in accordance with its principles. It is
generally uniform in its operation. However, the statutory enact-
ments of State Legislatures overcome and displace it so far as they
conflict with it. These enactments differ materially in different
States, owing to unlike conditions and local differences. Thus it
is that the laws of certain States are so radically unlike the laws
of other States. Of course, there are instances in which statutes
are passed to cover acts and conditions not provided for by the
common law; but in most instances the existing statutes qualify 1
displace or render inoperative some rules of the common law. The
:	94	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
repeal of statutes having this effect restores the common law rules
to their former force and efficacy. In view of these facts, thorough
j instruction is here given in the common law. Neither lawyers
; nor judges pretend to know the statutes of any other State than
i	that in which they practice or premie. Moreover, no court
i	pretends to take judicial cognizance of or know the statutes of any
| other State than that in which it has its being and jurisdiction.
In fact a knowledge of the statutes of different States would be
more confusing and bewildering than profitable to judge, lawyer
and student. In an examination for admission to the bar in any
State in the Union no question is put and nothing is said relative
to the statutes of any other State. There are, however, certain
fundamental statutory enactments that exist without material
diversity in their scope and purpose in almost all the States.
Again, other statutes somewhat less important and fundamental
in character exist in groups of States. Such statutes as these may
profitably be studied in class, in connection with the common law;
but it would be worse than useless for a student to attempt to
investigate [and study the mazes of statutory differences in the
several States. Hence it is recommended as advisable for each
student to bring with him when he comes here in September to
pursue the study of law a copy of the revised statutes of his own
State or of the State in which he proposes to practice.
In the Matter of Expenses
no discrimination is made between law students and the students
of the regular collegiate courses. Board, lodging, tuition, washing,
mending of linen, etc., cost SI50 per session, or $300 for the two
sessions or ten months comprising the scholastic year. Isolated as
Notre Dame is, students enjoy immunity from the distractions and
temptations of city life and need incur no noteworthy expenses
aside from those stated. They live in an atmosphere of study, and
every incentive and feeling of emulation aroused in them tends to
the formation of studious habits. Thus their work is rendered
peculiarly effective. It has often been demonstrated that
i nowhere else do students accomplish more work in a given time,
i This fact is not to be overlooked in considering the matter of
expense. In order to maintain this salutary state of things the
same rules of discipline apply to all students, whether in the Law
LAW DEPARTMENT.

Department or in the collegiate courses. Free access may be had
at reasonable hours, not only to the Lemonnier Library, but also to
the Law Library. This contains all the standard text-books and
reports. Every decision rendered for several years in the State,
Territorial and Federal courts may be found in the Law Library.
Consequently students need purchase but very few law-books. In
this regard they are specially favored, for at other law schools the
item of books alone for each student frequently amounts to from
$100 to $300.
Young men eligible to begin the study of law may be matricu-
lated as students of this Department at any time during the year.
They are charged only from the date of entrance. However, it is
advisable to enter at or near the beginning of the session. Students
in the graduating year are known as Seniors. The others are
called Juniors. All law students, whether Seniors or Juniors, whose
general education is sufficiently advanced toplace them on a footing
with students in the Senior or Junior class in the collegiate course,
are entitled to free rooms in Sorin Hall.
A Post-Graduate Course
for law students has recently been established. Graduates may
return at any time and enter upon the studies of this course. By
devoting a year to the work prescribed and passing the examination
they become entitled to the degree of Master of Laws. They are
given free rooms and have all the rights and privileges of other
post-graduates. The course of instruction consists mainly in the
analytical study and writing of pleadings, the examination of
witnesses, the taking of depositions, the trial of actions at law and
suits in equity, the practical application of rules of evidence, the
preparation of briefs and arguments for the higher courts, the study
of leading cases, practice from time to time in what is popularly
called “office work,” daily participation in the exercises of the
“quiz class,” a comparative study of the legislation of different
countries, and the influence of the civil law upon the development
of modern jurisprudence. It is believed that the student who
finishes this course and reads carefully the revised statutes of his
State will be qualified to enter at once upon the practice of law.
Every student who is a candidate for the degree of Bachelor of
Laws or. Master of Laws is required to write, at least six weeks
before graduation
96	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
A Thesis
upon some legal topic selected by himself. It should not be less
than 40 folios in length. The writer is expected to read the thesis
at a special meeting of the class and to defend the propositions set
forth in it. Having read and defended it successfully, he places it
I in the hands of the Dean of the Faculty, whose approval it must
have. If it be not meritorious in matter, form and style, the
student may forfeit the right to be considered a candidate for
graduation until the following year and the submission by him of
a satisfactory thesis.
In Conclusion
it may be stated that nowhere can the study of law be more profit-
ably pursued than at Notre Dame. The diligent student may here
qualify himself to pass the most rigid examination in any State.
He may lay broad and deep the foundation of his legal knowledge
and fit himself to become notable in the profession and worthy of
its honors.
Students here have a decided advantage over those of some other
law schools, in that they are not so numerous as to make the Law
Class unwieldly and cumbersome. It is hardly noticed in some
places who does and who does not attend class, and the relative
standing of the students is often quite unknown to the professors.
So numerous are they that the books of even a vast library would
be inadequate for their use. A score of them may desire to
refer to and read the same book at the same time. Taking moot-
court cases in turn, they can hardly try before the professors more
than one or two in the year. They may not be required to answer
each on an average more than one question a week. They receive
little or no practical instruction. Left almost wholly to themselves
in the choice of methods of study, it is not remarkable that there
should be an absence of system in the work they do, nor is it
singular that many of them utterly fail to make substantial
progress. Such evils almost inevitably attend the work of
instructing a class very large, unwieldly and cumbersome. More-
over, a large corps of professors would be requisite in such case.
And who does not know that the larger the corps of professors, the
more difficult for them to act in unison, to avoid repetition, to
LAW DEPARTMENT.	97
cover the law in its entirety, to understand readily and work
effectively to overcome the peculiar weaknesses and drawbacks of
each student ?
Law students at Notre Dame have none of these evils to contend
against. Here each member of the class comes frequently in con-
tact with the professors and becomes well known to them. He is
directed and aided in his work. He is required to attend class
regularly and to obey in his deportment and the discharge of his
duties certain prescribed rules of discipline—rules of discipline
deemed necessary for his welfare. Thus he may be strengthened
at every weak point. Thus he may be rounded out into sym-
metrical and useful manhood. Thus may his character be
formed in the mold of honor and impressed with the noble traits
and admirable qualities of gentleman, scholar and lawyer.

The buildings of this college were erected on the most approved
plans, after a study of the best institutions of the kind at home
and abroad. Convenience, ventilation, and an abundance of light
are provided for in all the rooms. The main building is 107 feet
long by d6 feet wide and three stories high. The old machine-shop
serves as a mechanical laboratory, and consists of two rooms: the
one 50 feet long and 20 feet wide, the other 30 feet long and 20
feet wide.
The Institute is divided into three principal departments: that of
Theoretical and Experimental Engineering, the department of
Practical Mechanics, and the department of Machine Drawing and
Design.
I.—Engineering Department.
This department is divided into two principal sections: that of
the class-room or Theoretical Engineering, and that of the Mechan-
ical Laboratory or Experimental Engineering.
(1)	Section of Theoretical Eng ineering.—The course of studies
in the class-room during the Junior Year comprises the subjects of
Materials of Construction, Kinematics or Mechanical Movements,
and the Principles of Machine Design. The study of the materials
of construction in the class-room is supplemented in the laboratory
by testing and examination of the various ores, metals, and woods.
The principles of Kinematics and Machine Design are illustrated
by models in the lecture-room and further explained in the draw-
ing-room.
The Senior Year is devoted to the study, by text-book and
lecture, of Thermodynamics, the Theory of the Steam Engine and
other motors, the construction and operation of boilers and pumps.
A graduating thesis and drawing, and a specimen of shopwork are
required of each candidate for a degree at the close of the year.
(2)	Section of Experimental Engineering.—This department is
devoted to calorimetry and the standarization of instruments; the
adjusting and operation of prime movers, boilers and pumps, with
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.	99
precise measurements of their power and efficiency; the testing of
the strength and properties of the materials of construction, the
metals, woods, oils, etc. The purpose of this course is not only to
familiarize the student with the apparatus employed but to teach I
him some of the methods of research and prepare him for the
prosecution of original investigations.
II.—Department of Practical Mechanics.
This department is divided into three sections: Wood-working,
Blacksmithing, and Machine-shop Work.
(1) Section of Wood-working.—This section comprises three
courses: 1st, the course in Joinery, in which the student is taught
the use and care of hand tools, the making of joints and parts of
structures, and the best methods of laying off and executing the
most familiar operations of the joiner and carpenter; 2d, the course I
of Wood-Turning, in which he learns the use of the lathe and I
acquires a fair degree of skill in working to measurement; 3d, the
course of Pattern Making, which is a combination of the other two
for mechanical purposes. The machine tools used in this course,
besides the lathes, are the scroll saw, the planer, the saw bench, and
universal trimmer.
(5) Section of Blacksmithing.—This course is intended to
familiarize the student with the methods of working iron and steel
under heat, the best conditions for forming and welding,
and the proper method of making and tempering tools for use in
the forge-room and machine-shop. It also gives him a dexterity
that will be of value in the following course.
(5) Section of Machine-Shop Work.—The exercises of this
course are graded and designed to illustrate the use of the tools
rather than for purposes of market or further use. The tools em-
ployed are the lathe, planer and shaper, drill-press, milling-
machine, grinding apparatus, etc., such as are most commonly met
in general practice.
III.—Courses in Machine Drawing*.
Instruction in this course begins with free-hand sketching of the
parts of machines some of which may afterwards be made to scale.
Linear drawing and the use of instruments follow; and the prin-
ciples of descriptive geometry are taught until the student can

work with certainty and precision. Students in the courses of
kinematics and machine design study on the drawing-hoard more
fully the details of mechanisms and the relations of connected
parts. This is done under the direction of the instructors of those
branches, who also assist in thesis work and the designing of
complete machines. Tracing, blue-printing, coloring, and the
conventionalities of drawing are practiced extensively. Many of
the prints are used in the shops, thus rendering the work more
interesting and instructive.
Special Courses.
Those who do not take the course of Engineering may, if recom-
mended by the Director of Studies, enter the shops for a course in
manual training or for the purpose of acquiring skill in practical
mechanics.

The “Noire Dame Scholastic”
is the title of a neat 24-page paper, devoted to the interests of the
students, which is published at the University every week during
Term time. This journal opens a field for young writers, who
might otherwise, for want of a proper medium, allow their talents
to remain inactive.
The Scholastic contains articles of an instructive literary
! character, interesting Biographical sketches, Essays, Poetry, Notes
I on Art, Music, Science and Literature, Notes of New Publications,
| etc., etc.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic has a local
importance for students, their parents, and all who have attended
class at the University in times past, on account of the weekly
summary of events transpiring at Notre Dame, personal notices of
former students, Rolls of Honor, Class Honors, List of Excellence,
etc., which appear in its columns every week. Reports relative to
; the arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented
and energetic students, etc., also find a place in this paper, and
keep parents and others informed on all that concerns their chil-
dren and friends.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the coming year
to merit the encouragement given the paper in the past, and the
encomiums bestowed upon it by the press in general.
