HISTORICAL.
In building the University of Notre Dame, the founders
sought to make it a home from which the benefits of
Christian education might be spread to the youth of 4he
land. Realizing, however, that, to enter the university
proper, a certain standard of excellence must first be reached,
it was decided that such a degree of excellence as was
required, could be attained better here, if a preparatory
school were maintained in connection with the university,
than it could be if the boys were forced to acquire it in
the public school. From the very opening of the university’s
doors therefore, they have been free for students desiring
preparatory education as well as for those that desire to
pursue more advanced studies. In fact the first pupil
was a Minim. This unique distinction belonged to the late
Alexis Coquillard, of South Bend.
From this combined preparatory and academic school
grew the separate schools, and eventually St. Edward’s Hall
was erected as the junior part of the preparatory department.
The first move toward making this branch of the school
a separate department in itself, was made in 1854, twelve
years after the founding of the institution. During the
first years of its existence the Minim department was in
charge of lay teachers, principally women, of whom Miss
McCambray was the first. She was succeeded by Miss
Birch, a lady from Kentucky. Next came Miss Blake,

and after her Mrs. Stace, mother of Professor A. W. Stace,
who was so prominent in the early history of Notre Dame.
After Mrs. Stace left, the care of the younger boys was
entrusted to Miss Moss and Mrs. Williams who watched
over the department until 1863. At that time Father Sorin
decided that it would be more advantageous to have the
Minims in charge of Sisters than to have them governed
by lay teachers. Hence Mother M. Angela, the famous
foundress of the Order of the Sisters of the Holy Cross
in America, was entrusted with the organization of the
Minim department as we have it today. She nominated
different sisters to preside over the work of the department
until Sister M. Aloysius, the present superioress was ap-
pointed to that position in 1874.
At that time the little fellows were still domiciled in
a part of the ground floor of the present infirmary building,
as it existed before the fire of ’79. Under her guidance,
however, such progress was made that it was found necessary
to erect a separate building for the boys under her charge
and to enlarge the campus in order to make room for
them. This led to the erection of the present spacious
building known as St. Edward’s Hall, which received its
name from the founder of Notre Dame, Father Edward
Sorin. After moving into the new building in 1882 so great
was the advancement made by the department and so many
were the new pupils added to its register that it was found
necessary to augment very materially its staff of teachers.
At the present time the Hall has more than a hundred
pupils with a staff of thirteen Sisters as teachers. More-
over, this regular staff of teachers is assisted by seven of
the university professors in such branches as music, com-
position, languages, drawing and painting, elocution and
physical culture. In addition to this there are three brothers

of the Holy Cross who look after the Minims during their
recreation hours and watch over them in the dormitories.
It is a matter of pride to those that are in charge of
St. Edward’s Hall, and perhaps it should be mentioned in
closing its history, that during the life of Very Rev. Father
Sorin, this was the department in which he took particular
pride. Nothing pleased him so much as to be /present
occasionally at some of the Minim recitations or to be out
among the boys while they were at play. So great was
his attachment for them that the pupils of St. Edward's
Hall, in order to show their appreciation of his attention to
them, organized a military company which was known as
the “ Sorin ” cadets, and still exists under that name.
This brief historical outline will give one a notion of the
origin and the development of the separate department at
Notre Dame, designed for the training and schooling of
small boys. It must not be thought, however, that because
St. Edward’s Hall is separate by itself, it is an independent
institution, apart from the rest of Notre Dame, for such is
not the case. Its separation from the university proper is
only in so far as the care and special provisions for the
young boys may require; so far as the general administration
is concerned it is a part of the institution and is under the
control of the President and the Board of Trustees of the
university itself.

DESCRIPTION.
St. Edward’s Hall is located in the north-eastern corner
of the university group of buildings, a little to the north
of the Academy of Music and east of the Main Building.
It is a large, four story, brick building, one-hundred-and-fifty
feet long and sixty-five feet wide. As shown in the cut
presented in the opening pages of this catalogue, the exterior
of the building is plain and is approached by two main
entrances. Interiorly the building is well laid out to suit
the convenience of the purpose for which it was erected, and
is artistically decorated throughout the corridors, the parlors,
the chapel and many of the class rooms.
On the lowest floor of the building are located the
lavatories, toilet rooms, one or two of the clothes rooms,
bath rooms, etc. The second floor is divided into the St.
Edward’s chapel, parlor, reception room, class rooms, study
and society halls. A large corridor leads through the center
from east to west and two others cross this at right angles.
On the walls of these corridors are some frescoes by the
famous artist, Signor Gregori, numerous group pictures
taken of Minims of other years, and the names of pupils
who were in the hall at the celebration of the Golden
Jubilee of Notre Dame or who were leaders among their
companions. On the third floor of the building are more
class and recitation rooms, the music hall and the principal
10
ST. EDWARD'S HALL.
dormitories. On the fourth flat are the remaining dor-
mitories.
The various rooms in St. Edward’s Hall are all large,
well lighted and well ventilated. The building is heated
throughout by steam and is lighted by electricity so that
there is absolutely no danger of fire. The equipment is,
in every respect, as thorough and as up to date as carefulness
and a judicious expenditure of money can make it. One
of the things that most readily appears to the eye of an
observer is the order and scrupulous cleanliness that is
to be noticed on all sides. Even in the play rooms where
it might be expected that such young boys might leave
things in a careless condition, everything is as neat and
orderly as one would find it in a well conducted home.
On the eastern end of the building is an annex more
than two hundred feet long, which is divided into a library,
game rooms, play hall, gymnasium, athletic club rooms,
clothes rooms, etc. This annex does not show in the cut of
the hall which appears in the first pages, but later on we
shall give a close description of its various apartments and
present some views of their interior. These will go to
show that the facilities offered to the young boys for spend-
ing recreation hours in a manner most suitable to their age
and tastes are as complete as could well be expected. At
the same time we will give descriptions of the campus
and the various places where the Minims conduct their
outdoor games.
An important thing in connection with the description
of St. Edward’s Hall is to make mention of the park in
front of the building. This park, named for the hall before
which it stands, is considered the most beautiful part of the
university grounds, which have attracted attention as the

The Advantages of St. Edward’s Hall.
The advantages of having a separate department at the
university for boys under thirteen years of age are so many
and so evident that it would seem almost unnecessary to
mention them. In the first place if parents are desirous
of having their sons sent away to school when they are
still of such tender age, they must fully realize that special
care and attention should be given to these young boys.
However, it would be a difficult matter to make special
provisions for them, unless they be kept alone and be under
the supervision of prefects and instructors that can devote
their whole time to caring particularly for them. It would
be practically impossible to make any deviation from the
ordinary curriculum in order to benefit them, if they were
permitted to be among the other boys, for the discriminations
in any department, as among men in the world, always work
unsatisfactorily.
Again the intimate association of such young boys with
older ones does not always lead to the best results. What-
ever they notice in their elders they will strive to imitate,
but it too often happens that they notice only the rougher
side of their companions’ actions. Children, below the age
of thirteen years, it must be remembered, can not be expected
to use either discretion or judgment in shaping their actions,
and the evil influence of one thoughtless person would leave
14
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
a bad impression on their youthful minds that could not be
easily removed.
Still another advantage in having; the Minims by them-
selves is this: their studies, their manner of spending recre-
ation and their tastes in general are very much different
from those of the more advanced boys. Hence they can do
better in class-work if they follow such lines as are specially
planned for them, and they will enjoy their games much
better if they are where they can play them without inter-
ference from older boys. Life in St. Edward’s Hall is thus
made more home-like for them since the rules and regula-
tions are especially fitted to suit their best interests. There
are a hundred and one little things that go to make up their
comfort and happiness, that could not be taken into account
if they were not in a separate department. It must be noted
here too, that the principal care of looking after these little
fellows is entrusted chiefly to the sisters of the Holy Cross.
And none better than these same sisters know how to take
the place of the absent mother in looking after the training,
the progress, the welfare and happiness of those left in their
care.
SPECIAL ADVANTAGES.
The advantages enumerated above have all been general
in their nature, and refer to the benefits that are derived
from making the daily routine followed by the little boys,
something separate and distinct from that of the advanced
students. These advantages are merely temporary and
exist only while the student is a member of St. Edward’s
Hall.
There is, however, another advantage and this is the
most important of all, inasmuch as it benefits the student
through the remaining years of his college course. The
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
15
advantage here mentioned is this: that of making the initial
and preparatory courses at an institution, in which the
student can follow right along to graduation in one of the '
collegiate courses. This saves very much trouble and gives
a pupil a better foundation for his work. It has been found
when students come here after making their preparatory
course in High schools or, perhaps, in some academies, they
would be qualified thoroughly enough in some lines of
studies, whereas other lines were totally neglected. Hence
a student that might enter as a Freshman in some studies
might be two or three years behind in others, and he would
be held back to make these up.
Again the system of teaching in the other schools
which he had attended might be so much different from
ours that the change might be a great draw-back to him
on the start, and thus operate against him all through his
course. Both these disadvantages are overcome by starting
in as a pupil in St. Edward's Hall. The course of studies
followed there is arranged to lead up gradually through’
the higher preparatory studies in Carroll Hall and from
these into the collegiate courses, with the same evenly
balanced progress as, in the graded school for example,
the primer leads to the first reader, the first to the second,
the second to the third, etc. The system is planned in such
a way that the young mind can readily accommodate itself
to it, and, this done, the making of a successful college
course thereafter is only a matter of time and of giving an
amount of labor proportionate to the advance made in
studies. That this has been a successful scheme has been
repeatedly proved in the examinations held at the end of the
preparatory course, to determine the eligibility of students
for entrance into the academic department. In these exam-
inations it has almost invariably been the case that those
16

boys who came from St. Edward’s Hall were easily superior
to the young men who had prepared themselves in other
schools. Being thoroughly trained for every line which they
are to follow in the next years of their college life, these
ex-Minims take the lead at the entrance examinations, hold
it all through their course, and are frequently the ones on
whom class honors fall.

DISCIPLINE.
Continued and varying experience in the care and
handling of young boys has brought about the system of
discipline now enforced in St. Edward’s Hall. Certain
restrictions must necessarily be laid upon pupils of their
age, and rules of conduct must be formulated which they
must strictly obey. Yet every liberty that is compatible with
careful training, and every privilege conformable to their
proper development are granted to the Minims. Those in
charge of the department realize that childhood is the most
impressionable time of man’s life, and that the effects of
early training are lasting. Hence it is sought to influence
the Minims by such methods only as will develop in their
youthful minds a love for order and rightful conduct, a
proper respect for superiors and a taste for such habits as
will bring them honor in after life. Every care is given
to see that they are kept from everything that would in the
least taint their morals, that, if Catholic, they be instructed
in the principles of religion, and that they be taught to
strive after such virtues and manly habits of character as
will make them estimable young men. As in a well regulated-
home, recourse is had to kindness rather than severity.
The Sisters feel that they fill the place of the absent mother
and try to make their instructions lead the boys along such
lines as their parents would most desire them to follow.
The discipline is thus more like the regulation of an orderly
st. Edward’s hall.
19
home than like the strict mandates of a boarding school.
In order to keep the little fellows impressed with the love
and respect which they owe their parents, they are required
to write to them at least once a week.
As an incentive toward encouraging the boys to keeping
the rules, an honor system has been established. At a con-
spicuous place in the hall is placed a black-board containing
the “ Roll of Honor ” on which are placed the names of
all those whose conduct has been conformable to all regula-
tions and whose work has been satisfactory to their teachers.
There is great rivalry among the boys to have their names
appear on this board, and when for any act or omission one’s
name is removed it is considered a great punishment. Then,
too, there is a gold medal awarded at the end of two full
years to those whose deportment has been exceptionably
good. As this fact is made known to the Minim immediately
after his entrance, he generally endeavors to shape his con-
duct with a view to receiving an “ Honor.” It has been
found that such incentives as these have been far more
—A
effectual toward the development of good character than
would be an application of the strap or the rule. This latter
method finds no place in St. Edward’s Hall, for seldom, if
ever, is it employed.	•
The order of the day in St. Edward’s Hall is as follows:
Rising at 6140 a. m., toilet, etc.; breakfast at seven, after
which a short time is allowed for recreation and exercise;
at half past seven studies and classes are begun and con-
tinued without intermission until half past nine; from half
past nine until ten recreation is given and a luncheon is
served for those that desire to partake of it. At ten classes
are again taken up and followed until 11:45; 11145, toilet;
twelve, dinner, followed by recreation; from one until three
study and class; three recreation and luncheon; half past
20
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
four until half past six study and classes; half past six
supper followed by recreation. Eight o’clock retiring.
From this it may be seen that the work has been ar-
ranged as judiciously as possible toward furthering mental
and physical development at the same time. Out of the
thirteen hours and a half that constitute the Minim’s work
day, they spend barely eight hours in class work and study,
and are never at work more than two hours at a time. This
gives them ample opportunity to take such recreation as
boys of their age require, and perhaps to this, more than
to any thing else, is due the fact that they are so healthy
and rugged. The recreation and exercise in the fresh air
between each two hours of study, unbind the mind and
prepare the boys to return to their work with a freshness
and vigor that does very much toward hastening their
progress. During recreation hours as well as in the class
and study-room the Minims are always under the super-
vision of the Brothers. The presence of the Brothers is not
intended as a means of keeping order so much as it is to
help the little fellows along and administer to any of their
needs.
SOCIETIES.
There are two societies in the Minim department, that
of the Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its
object to supply servers for the Church offices; and the
Sorin Association which has been established with a view
to give the pupils a start in elocution as early as possible.
This society is presided over by one of the professors who
finds it a pleasant duty to train these interesting young
talkers. Meetings are held once a week after school hours.
These meetings are a source of pleasure as well as of profit
to the young enthusiasts. Not infrequently are they honored
at these meetings by the presence of some of the university
st. Edward’s hall.
21
officials who take pleasure in attending, in order to encourage
them and watch the development they are making. The
members prepare original compositions, deliver declamations,
are trained to debate, etc. Only the best behaved and more
advanced are admitted to membership. As a further en-
couragement for this young literary society a gold medal
is annually awarded at commencement time to the one who
has done the best work, and who shows his merit in open
contest. In conclusion it may be said of this society that it
has the honor of furnishing the representative who delivers
the greetings from St. Edward's Hall to the President of
the University on President’s day.

THE MINIMS’ CAMPUS.
The campus set aside for the exclusive use of the
Minims is an eight acre, level field, directly north of their
play hall. It is located on the brow of St. Joseph’s lake
thus commanding one of the finest views of any of the many
splendid scenes at Notre Dame. This field is a place of
great activity during those seasons in which outdoor games
may be played. There are several base ball diamonds on
which, during the warm weather in spring and summer,
organized teams battle for championship honors in the
national game and for the medals awarded to the champion
nine.
Then there are three or four gridirons where enthusias-
tic football players develop brawn and muscle in the great
college game, Rugby. Around the outside of the field a
track is laid where the track athletes and bicycle riders do .
their work. It may be said here, too, that in proportion
to the number of pupils it contains, St. Edward’s Hall has
more athletes and bicycle riders than any other department
at the university. It is a pleasing sight to notice these
youngsters playing their various games, in which they put
their whole spirit and in which they labor as intensely as
if the whole world were waiting for the results. Great is
the honor of those that come out victorious, while for the
vanquished, their dejection is almost immeasurable.
%
In addition to the things already mentioned the campus
24
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
is welll supplied with swings, May-poles, turning poles, a
tennis court, a large toboggan slide for the winter days,
and many other apparatus with which the Minims may
spend their recreation hours in an enjoyable manner. That
they take advantage of the opportunities afforded, can
readily be seen if one makes a visit to their campus on
any day when the weather permits them to be out doors.

ATHLETICS.
Young boys need a great amount of vigorous and
wholesome exercise, when they are required to do much
mental work. Study is wearing enough on any person,
but for the youth who does not directly see the benefit
of it, application to books is doubly tiresome. He measures
greatness more by the standard of sports than by any such
qualities as broadmindedness and culture. Hence to satisfy
his longing for games, his desire to match his skill and
strength with his fellows, he must be given ample oppor-
tunity to engage in such contests. Thus will his mind be
relieved of the strain that study would naturally put upon
it. And if there is any truth in the old saying that “ all
work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” it must neces-
sarily follow that a suitable amount of play will sharpen
the intellect and render its possessor much more competent
to work in a beneficial manner. Besides this, play developes
a strong constitution, a sound physical strength, agility
of body and a confidence in one’s own ability. This is
particularly true of young boys, who are most susceptible
of training. Bearing these facts in mind, the authorities
of St. Edward’s Hall have made every possible provision
in order to give the little fellows a plenty of opportunity
for athletics. It must not be inferred, however, that they
permit all play and no work. Only during regular recre-
ation times can there be any attention given to the subject
of games and athletics, and these are never allowed to
26
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.	27
interfere in any way with class work. Every game is
encouraged at its proper time, but when the hour for study
comes, they must all be stopped.
Base ball and football are the two chief sports among
the Minims. In spring there are as many as eight or nine
different nines competing for the championship of the hall.
The rivalry among these various teams is something intense.
Toward the close of the season the two teams with the best
record play a series of five games and to the winners of this
series go all the honors. Each member of the team is
presented with a gold medal. In football the rivalry is
about the same, except for the fact that the strongest team
usually plays most of its games with boys from Carrol
Hall, and sometimes with junior teams from South Bend.
No medals are awarded to the members of the championship
eleven. Track athletics are being rapidly developed, and
for the spring of 1902 there are no less than five teams
in St. Edward's Hall. Among these are some clever little
athletes who may be winners on the university team if
they remain until they complete a collegiate course.
In warm weather the Minims are allowed to go swim-
ming nearly every evening in St. Joseph’s lake. Of all
sports this is the one the young boys particularly enjoy.
When the Brother announces the hour for going to the lake
•everyone is sure to be on hand with his bathing suit.
Whenever the boys go swimming they are always accom-
panied by Brothers and are not allowed to go beyond
certain stakes in the water so that there is absolutely no
danger of any one’s being drowned. The Brothers teach
them how to swim and see to it that none of them are left
to remain in the water too long. Whenever it is found that
■one’s health is not in proper condition to permit of his going
into the lake he is never allowed to do so.

The Different Apartments in the Annex to
St. Edward’s Hall.
f
In describing St. Edward’s Hall mention was made
of an annex two hundred feet long built on the eastern end
of the building. The principal object the builders had in
adding this annex was to furnish places for the Minims
to spend their recreation hours when the weather is too
inclement to permit them to be outdoors. On this account
much attention was given to the furnishing of the
GYMNASIUM,
a room forty-eight feet long and twenty-eight feet wide,
thoroughly equipped with every apparatus which might be
used to advantage by the little fellows. In it are to be found
running ladders, rings, punching bag, horizontal and
parallel bars, turning pole, climbing poles and ladders,
Swiss ladders, dumb-bells, clubs, weights, springboards,
mats, horses, pyramid frames, etc., etc. This apartment
is now used merely as a practice room since the building
of the large university gymnasium, as the boys are taken
to that for gymnastic instruction. Next in importance to
the gymnasium is the
PLAY HALL,
a large room one hundred and ten feet long and thirty feet
wide. Here all such games as basket ball, indoor base ball,
hand ball, etc., are played, and here in fact, is where the
Minims spend the greater part of their recreation hours
during the season of rough weather. This room is also
used for drilling the Sorin cadets. The
READING ROOM,
is thirty feet long and twenty feet wide. This, like the game
room, is tastefully decorated with potted plants and pictures
30

31
and furnished with comfortable chairs and couches, while
in one end is a small library. The works in the library are
chiefly such as would be attractive to young boys, for
example books like “ The Boy Trapper,” “ Four Young
Explorers,” “ Tom Brown’s School Days,” “ Father Finn’s
Stories,” “ Little Sailor Boy,” “ Adventures of Tom Saw-
yer,” “Robinson Crusoe,” “ Midshipman Bob,” “ Jet, the
War Mule,” “ Stories for Stormy Sundays,” “ Youth’s Com-
panion/3 “ Our Young People/3 etc., or any magazine or
paper they may wish from home.
THE GAME ROOM
immediately adjoining the play hall is eighty feet long and
twenty feet wide. The furniture in this room consists of a
piano, couches, rocking chairs, tables, trophies won by past
athletic teams, gifts made to the Minims in the way of
The Game Room.

ornaments, etc. The window shelves are all covered with
potted plants and the walls are all decorated with pictures.
In this room are played all such games as cards, checkers,
porchesi, parlor base ball, Kings and Queens, and such games
for young folks as “ Jackstraws,” “ Battle of Manilla,”
il Fireman,” “ Uncle Sam’s Mail,” etc., etc.

33
THE MAIN STUDY HALL.
The main study Hall for the more advanced pupils
in St. Edward’s is located oit the second floor at about
the center of the building. It is a large well ventilated
room with four windows on each side and two doors in
each end. Thus in warm weather it can be turned into
one of the most comfortable apartments at Notre Dame. It
is forty feet wide and forty-five feet long. There is a large
corridor at each end of the Hall leading to the main
entrances of the building. The study room is always kept
scrupulously clean and is made as attractive looking as
possible. In each of the eight windows are kept potted
plants or ferns, and the walls are all tastefully ornamented
with pictures. Tn one end of the hall are placed three
statues, representing St. Joseph, the Blessed Virgin and
our Lord. In the same end of the hall are large maps
and under these are the blackboards where the “ Tablet of
Honor ” is kept. There are forty-eight desks in this study
room, and a few extra seats placed along the sides.
In addition to this main study hall there are other
smaller ones where the youngest boys are kept and given
special instruction. The sisters in charge of these smaller
halls make it a point to visit at the different desks and help
the little fellows along in case they should meet with any
34
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
difficulties in the preparing of their lessons. Then, too,
these boys who are the youngest are not required to spend
eight hours a day at work; the time of study is shortened
to suit their years and regulated to suit their capacity.
These very young boys also have special refectories, in
which specially prepared food is served for them, and
special dormitories in which to sleep.	'

RECEPTION ROOM.
The reception room in which the Sorin Association
holds its meetings is on the second floor across the corridor
from the parlor. It contains a beautiful Everett Piano, and
all the furniture necessary to make of it a convenient and
comfortable place for society meetings. In one end is a
platform which serves the purpose of a stage. Back of this
is a large frescoe by the famous Gregori. It is a historical
picture showing the founding of the University of Notre
Dame.	•
THE LAVATORIES
are all located on the lower floor near the clothes room
so that they can be conveniently reached at all times either
from the campus, from the clothes rooms, or from the
athletic dressing rooms. The Minims are obliged to make
their toilet here before every meal, and sisters are at hand
to see that it is properly done. The boys are required to
brush their teeth carefully. Baths are taken once a week
or oftener as parents may require.
36
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
THE CLOTHES ROOM.
The clothes room is a very important department in
St. Edward’s Hall. In this each pupil has his wardrobe
in which to keep his clothes. Sisters are constantly in
charge of this room and they see to it that the boys clothing
is not carelessly thrown around. All necessary mending
and repairing is done by them. Each boy’s clothes are
folded carefully and placed in his locker in orderly condition.
Clothing is changed to suit the seasons and it is the duty
of one of the prefects to see that the boys follow this rule.
Often when the temperature suddenly changes in one day,
they may be made to change heavy clothes for light, or
light for heavy clothes. Underclothing is changed once
a week.

37
THE DORMITORIES.
The dormitories are all commodious and well ventilated.
Each one is presided over by a Brother. The most notice-
able thing in connection with these dormitories is the
immaculate cleanliness that prevails all through. The floors,
the bedding and everything is kept scrupulously clean.
The beds have springs with the ordinary mattress and
, over this is placed a hair mattress. Bedding is provided
in abundance so that during cold weather there need be
nothing lacking to keep the boys comfortable.-
38
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
THE REFECTORY.
At present the majority of the Minims take their meals
in the Carroll Hall dining room, which was originally
intended for only Carroll Hall students. Next summer,
however, a special refectory is to be added to St. Edward’s
Hall for the exclusive use of the Minims, who will then
enjoy the privilege of dining at their own building. What
the dimensions of the St. Edward’s dining hall will be
have not been given out as yet, but it will be sufficiently
large to accommodate all.

THE CHAPEL.
Just across the corridor at the east end of the study-
hall is the chapel, forty feet long and twenty-five feet wide.
The altars are in the east end of the room. The seats are
all made of white-oak. There is a fine, moderately large size
pipe organ in the rear. As the chapel touches only one
side of the building-, there are stained glass windows on
only one side of it. Three of these four windows are the
gifts of Mr. John Cudahy, Mr. Thomas D. Sexton and Mr.
Augustus Meehan, respectively. Opposite the windows are
four blind windows. The first, with representation of Saint
Ann, is the gift of Mr. George Moxley; the second, with
40
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
representation of Saint Theresa is the gift of Mr. Leo
Kelly; the third, with representation of Saint Augustine,
was given by Mr. Thomas J. Noonan; the fourth, with
representation of St. Peter, is the gift of Mr. John P.
Fortune. All these donors were at one time pupils in St.
Edward's Hall. The boys assemble in this chapel for
morning and evening prayers which last only a few minutes.
Occasionally they have Mass celebrated there especially
for them. On such occasions they have their own choir,
directed by a Sister, and occasionally one of their members
presides at the organ.
THE INFIRMARY.
So seldom is it that any of the boys in St. Edward’s
Hall are sick that no special infirmary has been found
necessary for them. When occasionally it happens that
one of them is complaining of any illness he is put in charge
of the nurses at the university infirmary and is visited
regularly by the house physician. In case of sickness the
boy’s parents are immediately notified. All that trained
skill and medical science can do is at once done for the
patient, hence when a Minim does go to the infirmary he
seldom remains there more than a few days. In order to
encourage the boys to guard against catching cold, etc.,
a premium is given to those whose health has been the
best during the year.

THE COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
The courses of instruction in St. Edward’s Hall
embrace all the studies commonly taught to boys under
thirteen years of age. They were planned with a view
to giving pupils a broad foundation for preparatory school
work and ultimately for university education. Therc are
many special branches such as music, painting, elocution,
etc., which are taught at the option of parents sending their
children here. Since boys as young as six years of age
are received into St. Edward’s Hall the courses necessarily
start with the primary studies and in some cases even with
the alphabet. From this they go through all the readers
and, supposing the boy to have started his course in St.
Edward’s Hall, by the time he is ready to leave there
and enter Carroll Hall he has finished his course and
passed through the sixth reader. United States History
is taught to the pupil as soon as he is far enough advanced
for it. Geography, descriptive, political and physical, is all
taken up and gone through in its turn. All studies in
orthography are finished. English grammar is also com-
pleted through parsing, analysis and diagramming. Harvey’s
text book is used. A good start in English composition is
given the boys at the close of their grammar studies.
Special attention is given to teaching arithmetic as this is
deemed one of the most important studies. When a boy
has finished the course of arithmetic in St. Edward’s Hall
42
ST. EDWARD’S HALL.
he has passed through mental arithmetic, through all the
common branches of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, fractions, common and decimal, mensuration, per-
centage and everything given in Brook’s Higher Arithmetic.
W hen this is completed, those that are advanced far enough
are put in the algebra classes and given a start for higher
mathematics. Penmanship, of course, is included in the
regular course of studies and in this line the pupils are
drilled thoroughly so that the course may be finished as
quickly as possible. Thus Reading-, Spelling, History,
Grammar, Geography, Arithmetic and Penmanship, all are
thoroughly covered by the boys that make the course in
St. Edward’s Hall. It is found, too, that when they reach
their thirteenth year they are usually as far advanced as
other boys of sixteen years who come from other schools.
These are the principal studies taught. Catechism
and Bible History are added only for Catholic bovs. Others
do not study them. One can see at a glance that these
studies include nearly every branch ordinarily taught to
young boys. They are well adapted to fit young fellows
either for a further course of collegiate education or for a
course in commercial studies, which both may be followed
here at Notre Dame. The President of the university visits
St. Edward’s Hall once a month to examine the boys and
see what progress they are making- with their work.
The above studies as well as instrumental music and
vocal culture are all taught by Sisters of the Holy Cross
who are famous for their efficiency as teachers, and who
form the regular staff of instructors in St. Edward’s Hall.
In addition to these there are many special branches taken
up and these for the most part are taught by regular pro-
fessors and instructors from the university. These special
courses include painting, drawing, elocution, physical

culture, and the languages. In painting of course only a
moderate amount of work can be done because the students
are so young that advanced work is impossible for them.
In drawing they are given the elementary principles,
such as outlines, drawing from examples and making'
rough sketches. In the languages they do very well. In
Latin, for example, they go through all the declensions and
conjugations thus acquiring a good foundation for further
work. In German and Spanish they go far enough to be
able to read and write these languages quite readily and the
same may be said of their work in French.

THE COURSES IN MUSIC.
The department of music in St. Edward’s Hall is
carefully looked after. Parents who bring their children
here with a desire of having them trained in the musical
line may rest assured that they will be thoroughly instructed.
There are several large piano rooms on the second floor
where those boys who take instructions on the pianoforte
do their daily practice. It should be mentioned here, too,
that these boys are not permitted to waste their time at
the piano as most boys are inclined to do when the tiresome
finger exercises begin to grow wearisome. A sister is
on duty all the time to see that they practice conscientiously.
The course of instruction in piano playing begins with
the most rudimentary work and goes as far along as the
student desires to follow those studies. Many of the young
fellows, that have a taste for music and have sufficient
talent to master its difficulties, have become quite proficient
performers in a short time. Some of them have even been
able to handle the pipe organ with a moderate degree of
skill. Violin and mandolin are the next most popular
instruments. There are many of these in use in St.
Edward’s Hall and among the boys is formed a mandolin
club which has made some creditable appearances in the
past year or two. Pupils are taught to play other instru-
ments such as banjo, guitar, the reed and brass instruments,
etc., if their parents so desire. However, these have not been
taken up very widely as yet. The piano, violin and mandolin
st. Edward’s hall.	45
are the instruments most used. During Commencement
week at the university, a concert is given by the pupils in
the Minim department, and the musical numbers on their
program are such as to win the approbation of visitors.
GENERAL REMARKS.
All that has been said in the foregoing pages of this
prospectus is intended merely as a matter of information
to parents who may be desirous of sending their sons to
the Minim department at Notre Dame. Naturally enough
before leaving their boys here they would have many
questions to ask concerning the care they receive, the
studies they take, the privileges they have, the discipline
that governs them, the attention given in case of sickness,
etc., etc. We have intended to make this little pamphlet
answer all such questions and thus save the trouble of
an almost endless amount of correspondence. In the first
place a close description is given of the Hall and its various
apartments. Then the discipline is outlined, the work set
apart for the Minims is discussed, and some pages are
devoted to explaining how the little fellows spend their
recreation hours. The accompanying cuts, such as those
of dormitories, class rooms, chapel, etc., are given to show
the accommodations provided to insure every comfort for
the pupils.

Hall are touched upon merely to show parents that the
sacrifice they make by depriving themselves of their child-
ren’s company, will be repaid by the facilities offered for
moulding these children into cultured and estimable young
men. We have tried to make plain the fact that as many
comforts as possible are supplied to the boys and that they
receive every attention that care can give them. The pupils
of St. Edward’s Hall are the privileged persons at Notre
Dame.

THE SORIN CADETS.
Light military drill is compulsory in the Minim depart-
ment. However, the boys are never required to do more
than two hours drilling in a week. They are supplied with
Remington rifles and put in charge of an experienced man.
There are three companies in the department and each
of them reaches a commendable degree of profficiency in
the art of drilling during the course of a year. We give
here a cut showing the cadets and their commander as
they appear for regular drill every Wednesday. The simpler
foot movements and the more common moves of shifting
the gun have been quite readily learned by them and on
some occasions they are called upon to march with the
companies of Carroll Hall. The uniforms used by the
Sorin cadets is of dark navy blue with red broadcloth
stripes on the legs of the trousers and around the wrist
of the coat sleeve. Brass buttons are used all through.
When thus attired the companies present a very fine
appearance.

Minim Department.
St. Mary’s Academy.
(One Mile West of the University of Notre Dame.)
Pupils who need primary education and those of tender
age, are here carefully prepared for the academic and
advanced courses. For the care and training of these
younger pupils there has been established a separate depart-
ment to which the most scrupulous attention has always been
paid by the sisters in charge of the institution. Great care
is taken to see that these Minims have every privilege and
e&ery comfort that is compatible with proper training.

The Notre Dame Scholastic.
Is the title of a neat 28-page paper, devoted to the
interests of the students, and published by them
at the University every week during Term time.
This journal opens a field for young writers who
might otherwise, for want of a proper medium,
allow their talents to remain inactive. It also
affords students an opportunity for practical exper-
ience in journalism. During seasons of special
interest at the University, The Scholastic is
published daily.
It'will be the endeavor of the Editors during the
coming year to merit the encouragement given the
paper in the past, and the encomiums bestowed
upon it by the press in general.
The Scholastic will be sent to any address for
$1.50 per annum.
