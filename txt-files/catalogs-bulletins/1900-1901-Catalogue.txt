NOTRE DAME UNIVERSITY.
The University of Notre Dame was founded in the year
1842, by the Very Reverend Bdward Sorin, the late Superior
General of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. In an act
approved January 15, 1844, the legislature of Indiana gave
the University power to grant degrees. The beginning of
this act is:
11 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of
Indiana, That Bdward Frederick Sorin, Francis Dewis
Cointet, Theophilus Jerome Marivault, Francis Gouesse,
and their associates and successors in office, be, and are
hereby constituted and declared to be, a body corporate and
politic, by the name and style of the ‘ University of Notre
Dame du Dac,’ and by that name they shall have perpetual
succession, with full power and authority to confer and grant,
or cause to be conferred and granted, such degrees and
diplomas in the liberal arts and sciences, and in law and
medicine, as are usually conferred and granted in other
Universities in the United States, provided, however, that
no degree shall be conferred or diplomas granted, except to
students who have acquired the same proficiency in the
liberal arts and sciences, and in law and medicine, as is
customary in other Universities in the United States.”

UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME.
ENGINEERING HALL.
The building set apart for the students of Engineering
is situated directly south of Science Hall. It is a large
three-story brick building, well lighted and heated and was
carefully designed for the special purpose it serves. Of the
three stories, the upper two are divided into lecture, recita-
tion and drawing rooms. These are used exclusively by the
Engineering students and are admirably arranged to meet
their needs.
The wood shop, machine shop and blacksmith shop are
on the first floor. The wood shop is supplied with modern
work-benches fully equipped with the smaller tools necessary
for carpentry, twelve lathes, for turning, a jig saw, a revolv-
ing planer, a circular saw, and a mortising machine,—the
whole forming an adequate equipment for a thorough mastery
of scroll work and pattern making. The machine shop con-
tains two steam engines, one horizontal, the other vertical,
and from these power is distributed to the various machines
by a line of shafting running the entire length of the build-
ing. The latest improved lathes have been provided, nine
in number, varying from a five inch swing in the smallest
to a large engine lathe of ten inch swing, with sixteen foot
bed. Two drill presses, a large planer, a shaping machine,
and a Brown and Sharp milling machine complete the
equipment, thus making the machine shop a model of its
kind. The blacksmith shop has the usual complement for
teaching forging, annealing, welding, and tool-making.
The southern portion of the second story of this Hall
is used for the
CIVIL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT.
The equipment of this department is sufficient for all the
practice and exercises in the field necessary to illustrate and
teach the practical methods of engineering. The instru-

This building has a revolving dome with an equatorial
telescope to which the students of Astronomy have access.
The transit-room and the computing - room contain the
smaller instruments and the works of reference.
THE INFIRMARY.
This building is 200 feet by 45 feet in ground measure-
ment and three stories in height. The rooms in this
building are for the use of students during illness. The
sick are nursed by Sisters of the Holy Cross, and the
University physician visits them daily.
THE GYMNASIUM.
The gymnasium, which was burnt down in November,
1900, was replaced by a building 230 by 100 feet in dimen-
sions. The track-hall is now 100 by 180 feet on the ground:
it is used for indoor meets, winter baseball-practice, basket-
ball and military drill. The gymnastic hall is 100 by 40 feet
and is furnished with a full set of new apparatus; below
that are the offices, dressing-rooms and showerbaths.
Friends of the University and the alumni contributed more
than $3000 to the fund for this building.
The Cartier field is an enclosed field for athletic games.
There is a prominent grand stand near the baseball diamond
and a cinder track, and a portable stand near the football
rectangle. The field contains ten acres of ground, and it
is a gift to the University from Mr. Warren A. Cartier,
C. E., of the class of ’87. ’

DISCIPLINE.
Official bi-monthly reports of each student’s class standing
will be sent to parents and guardians.
The Faculty maintains that an education which gives
little attention to the development of the moral part of a
youth’s character is pernicious, and that it is impossible to
bring about this development where students are granted
absolute relaxation from all Faculty government while out-
side the class-room. A young man must learn obedience
to law by the actual practice of obedience, not by mere
theoretical appeals to honor and a non-existent virtue of
obedience. -
Moreover, the quiet and concentration of mind that are
needed for collegiate work are not obtained except when
discipline exists.	.
Therefore the following regulations, shown to be salutary
by experience, are enforced at the University.
i.	No student shall leave the University grounds without
permission from the President or the person delegated to
represent him.
2.	Leave of absence ivill not be granted to students during-
the term time, except in cases of urgent necessity. There is no
vacation at Easter
*
3.	Students are required to report at the University
immediately after arriving at South Bend. This rule is
binding not only at the beginning of the scholastic year,
but at all other times when leave of absence has been
granted. Unnecessary delay in South Bend is looked upon
as a serious violation of rule. ,
22
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
4.	Flagrant disobedience io authority, cheating in exami-
nations, the use of intoxicating liquors, immorality, the use
of profane and obscene language and unothorized absence
from the college limits are among the causes for expulsion.
In a case of suspension or expulsion for such offences, no
fees will be rehirned.	•
5.	No branch of study will be taken up or discontinued
without the consent of the Director of Studies.
6/ Preparatory students are enrolled in Brownson,
Carroll or St. Bdward’s Hall according to age: boys
seventeen years of age or older are sent to Brownson Hall;
those over thirteen and under seventeen go to Carroll Hall;
and those under thirteen are in St. Bd ward’s Hall.
7.	The use of tobacco is forbidden except to those
students of Sorin, Corby and Brownson Halls that have
received from their parents written permission to use
tobacco.
8.	Continued violation of regulations in Sorin and
Corby Hall’s leads to forfeiture of rooms.
9.	While students of all religious denominations are re-
ceived into the University, it is nevertheless a strictly Catholic
institution, and all students are required to attend divine
service in the College Church at stated times.
10.	The use of intoxicating liquors is strictly pro-
hibited.	»
11.	To guard against all clandestine and improper cor-
respondence, the President reserves the right to supervise
letters to and from students.
12.	. Undue attention to athletics at the expense of study
will not be permitted, but students are expected to take
part in outdoor sports and other games.
13.	A limited number of athletic contests is permitted
with college organizations from without.
14.	All athletic associations of the students are strictly
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME.
23
forbidden to countenance anything that savors of profes-
sionalism.
15.	All athletics will be governed by a Faculty Board
of Control. The President of the University and members
of the Faculty will compose the Administrative Board, and
reserve the right of a final determination of all questions
concerning athletics. The Faculty Board will determine
the amateur standing of the members of the athletic teams,
and apportion the finances. By this means indiscreet and
unconsidered actions of the students will be checked.
LECTURES AND CONCERTS.
' Fach winter eminent men are invited to lecture before
the students. Concerts are also given monthly by organiza-
tions from without.

Courses in Artistic Drawing and Painting.
In this department the aim is to lay a thorough foundation
in drawing and painting for those that wish to make art a
profession, but the courses are so arranged as to be accessible
to other students. The system of teaching which, is that
followed in the best art schools, is intended to develop the
individuality of each student, so that with a good under-
standing of the principles of art he may interpret nature
according to his own temperament.
The work is done altogether from cast, object, and nature.
The immediate surroundings of the University buildings,
the lakes and the Saint Joseph River offer many beautiful
subjects for the study of landscapes, and the classes are taken
out in the summer for this study.
To the old collection of casts has been added a new one,
which was carefully selected at the National School of Fine
Arts in Paris, where all the casts are moulded directly from
the originals. The collection is as follows:
Full Figure—The Diadumenos (British Museum); the
Doryphoros (Naples). These two figures are full size.

Introduction to the Course in General Science*
The Course in General Science is calculated to afford
such an acquaintance with the methods and facts of modern
science as will best enable the student to fit himself, either
for further study of a technical or professional kind, or for
the activities of business life. The Natural and Physical
Sciences constitute the primary studies of this Course.
Grouped about these are those studies in English, Mathe-
matics, and the Modern Languages, which experience has
shown to be necessary for the intelligent pursuit of science
and for the attainment of the object of the Course.
Two essays on scientific topics are required of every
student during the Sophomore Year and two during the
Junior Year.
The scientific work of the Senior Year is elective.
Advanced courses may' be chosen in Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, or Mathematics.	'
Every candidate for a degree in the Course of General
Science is required to submit, at least six weeks before the
final examinations, a written thesis upon some subject con-
nected with the elective work of the Senior Year. The
subject chosen must have the approval of the Professor in
the course elected. The Thesis shall contain not less than
six thousand words, and must be satisfactory in matter
and treatment.
Students that complete the required courses, pass the
final examinations, and present a satisfactory thesis will
receive the degree of Bachelor of Science.

Introduct'on to tke Course in Civil Engineering*
The Courses of instruction are designed to prepare students
by a thorough and systematic training in the sciences and in
the principles of Civil Engineering, to perform intelligently
the duties of their profession either in the office or in some
of the responsible positions superintending the construction
and operation of public works. To secure these results the
student is given, not only a sound theoretical training in the
studies of the Courses, but he is also required to study
the practical applications of the principles upon which the
theory is based. The first two years are devoted to »the
o
study of Mathematics and the theoretical branches. The
last two years are given to the study of the applied courses,
practical work in the laboratory and field, so much as
possible, being required throughout the course.
Sufficient instruction is given in French and German to
enable the student to read easily and understandingly
professional works in these languages; while the study of
English is pursued until the student is qualified to prepare
acceptable, themes on professional subjects. Instruction
based upon standard text-books is given throughout the
course by means of lectures, recitations, practice in labora-
tory, drawing room, and field. This work is largely supple-
mented by assigning to the student, for solution, practical
problems bearing directly upon the subject matter discussed
in the class room and requiring original investigation, thus
training the student to habits of independence and awaken-
ing his interest in the work of his course.
The Department is provided with all the instruments
necessary for effective work in the different branches of field
Il8	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
Engineering. After the student is taught the use and
adjustments of the instruments, surveys, elementary in
character, are commenced and continued progressively until
the more difficult principles and methods are understood.
In a similar manner is instruction given in the Courses,
■Sanitary Engineering, Hydromechanics, Resistance of
Materials, Bridges and Roofs, etc., thus familiarizing the
student with practical Engineering subjects, and the most
approved methods of execution and designing.
A Thesis on some approved subject connected with the
course of study, is required of each student as a condition
of graduation. The Thesis must embody the results of
original research.

Introduction to the Course in Mechanical
Engineering*
The Course in Mechanical Engineering, leading to the
degree of Mechanical Engineer, is given to those young
men that wish to prepare themselves for the designing of
machinery, with its appurtenances, and for the successful
management of power-plants. As the course requires a
thorough knowledge of Pure and Applied Mathematics, as
well as of Physics, only those capable of adapting them-
selves to these requirements should take it up. The course
is modeled in the twofold belief that a thorough fundamental
training is essential to success in engineering, and (hat this
training is best secured by a study of the practical applica-
tion of the principles involved, as well as of the theoretical
principles.
The work of the department, conducted in connection
with other departments elsewhere described, consists of the
study, by text-book or lectures, of the materials used in
Mechanical Engineering, accompanied by the science of
pure mechanical kinematics, which traces the motions of
connected parts without reference to the cause of such
motions or to the work done or energy transmitted. This
is succeeded by machine design, which is a direct develop-
ment of kinematics, and the course continues throughout
the Junior and Senior Years.
The Courses in Shop work are most complete. The first
years’ work is confined to practice in the woodshop, in
which the principles of carpentry, turning, and pattern-
making are taught. When students have become sufficiently
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME.	121
skilled in woodwork, they take up the work of the foundry,
blacksmith shop, and machine shop. During the ensuing
year the advanced students will undertake the construction,
from an original design, of a rotary steam engine. A sys-
tematic course of training is provided, which advances the
student by easy steps until he has mastered all the details
of the art.
The latter part of the Senior Year is largely taken up in
the preparation of a Graduating Thesis. Here especially
the student is taught to depend as much as possible upon
his own resources and abilities in exercising his ingenuity.
It is the culminating effort of the Course, embodying the
chief results, and is expected to show considerable originality.

Introduction to the Course in Electrical
Engineering*
The remarkable development of electrical industries dur-
ing the past few years has created a demand for men skilled
in the theory and practice of Electrical and Mecnanical
work. The study of the subjects arranged on the following
page is intended to give a general education as well as
special training in the technical branches involved in the
various practical applications of electricity in industrial
pursuits.
General theory is given in lectures and by recitations from
standard text-books. In the laboratories and shops the
operations explained in the class room are performed by
the student, in which he acquires some skill in handling
tools and instruments, and obtains a working knowledge of
the principles involved. Careful records of the work done in
the laboratories are kept by the student and are handed in
for suggestions and corrections at the end of every week.
(For requirements of admission, degree, etc., see pages 102-103.)
THESIS.
Each candidate for a degree is required to prepare during
the Senior Year an acceptable Thesis embodying the results
Of an extended original research on an Engineering subject,
chosen at the beginning of the year, with the approval of the
head of the department. The descriptive part must be
typewritten and the drawings carefully made on white
cardboard.

Short Course in Applied Electricity.
Students that do not wish to take the languages and
higher mathematics required in the regular four-year course
should enter this shorter course, which may be completed in
two years. It is arranged to give an accurate knowledge of
the fundamental theories of electricity and magnetism, as
well as a certain amount of skill in handling electrical
machinery and appliances. Simple algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, and elementary physics and chemistry are
included, for they are necessary in order to carry on success-
fully the practical work of designing, manufacturing, and
testing or operating electrical apparatus. Training in this
practical work is given in the draughting room, the machine
shops, and in the electrical and physical laboratories.
The actual conditions of the commercial application of
electricity to the distribution of light and power are learned
by testing, repairing, and making additions to the Univer-
sity plant and by visiting the numerous electric plants in
the vicinity, accompanied by an instructor.
The study of the principles of mechanical drawing is taken
up early in the course and sufficient practice is given to
enable the student to make working drawings and to follow
them in the construction of apparatus in the shops and
laboratories.
Applicants for admission to this Course should be at least
seventeen years of age. They should have a fair knowledge
of the subjects taught in the common schools, especially
arithmetic.
When the required studies have been satisfactorily com-
pleted, a certificate stating that fact is issued.

COURSE IN ARCHITECTURE.
ADMISSION.
Candidates for admission to the Freshman Year must be
at least 17 years of age. For advanced standing there must
be a corresponding increase in the age limit.
DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE.
Those subjects that are not taught in the architect’s office
but which are necessary for an architect are especially
insisted upon in this course.
The work is technical and freehand drawing is thorough,
and the student is prepared for the expression of his archi-
tectural plans.
In construction and practice the courses prescribed for the
students in the civil and mechanical engineering schools are
followed with special application to arcitectural require-
ments. The aesthetic part of the work thus has a practical
and exact basis.
The history of architecture is taught by lecture and
illustrations.
The material equipment consists of plaster models,
engravings and photographs of noted buildings, books on
architecture, and the apparatus of the engineering and art
schools.

SCHOOL OF LAW.
For several years a systematic movement has been in
progress under the auspices of the bench and bar of the
country to elevate the standing and promote the efficiency
of the legal profession, and make it as learned in fact as
it is in name. The most essential preliminary step to this
end, as lawyers generally agree, is to prescribe requirements
and examinations more comprehensive and rigorous as a
test of qualifications for
ADMISSION TO THE BAR.
Upon the law departments of universities, or law schools,
as they may collectively be called, the profession must
mainly depend for co-operation and success in this laudable
undertaking^. In fact, due acknowledgment of the import-
ance of their services is made as follows in a former. report
of the Committee on Legal Education of the American Bar
Association :
“The benefits which law schools offer are easily suggested, and
are of the most superior kind. They afford the student an acquaint-
ance with general principles, difficult if not impossible to be otherwise
obtained; they serve to remove difficulties which are inherent in
scientific and technical phraseology, and as a necessary consequence .
they furnish the student with the means for clear conception and
accurate and precise expression. They familiarize him with leading
cases, and the application of them to discussion. They give him the
valuable habit of attention, teach him familiar maxims, and offer him
the priceless opportunities which result from contact and generous
emulation. They lead him readily to survey the law as a science,
and imbue him with the principles of ethics as its true foundation.
' Disputing, reasoning, reading, and discoursing, become his constant
ixercises; he improves remarkably as he becomes acquainted with
them, and obtains progress otherwise beyond his reach.”
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
I32
According to the late Chief Justice Waite, of the United
States Supreme Court, ‘ ‘ Law schools are now a necessity. ’ ’
And, in his work entitled ‘ ‘The American Commonwealth, ’ *
Professor Bryce attributes the progress in learning and
professional attainments of American lawyers ‘ ‘ to the
extraordinary excellence of many of the law schools. ’ ’
It is probably well that the Professor qualifies his state-
ment by using the word “many,” instead of “all,” in
referring to the work of the law schools of the country; for
some of them, regrettable to state, appear to be deficient in
wholesome zeal to co-operate in elevating the standing of
professional learning and ethics. They seem not to dis-
criminate. At any rate, they permit persons wanting even
in the rudiments of a liberal education to become candidates
for diplomas. Their attitude in this respect would seem to
indicate that a large attendance and substantial revenue are
placed paramount in the scale of importance to substantial
results in the equipment and training of students. Such of
these young men as manage without further preparation to
secure admission to the bar almost necessarily commit gross
mistakes in the technical work of the profession, and, in
consequence, clients are wronged, judges embarrassed and
courts delayed. While it is true that many of them abandon
the practice after a precarious experience and turn to pur-
suits for which they are better qualified, yet the step is
attended in some measure with disappointmemt and
humiliation, not to mention the comparative loss of time
and means incident to preparing for examination and wait-
ing vainly for success.
The movement in progress to protect and promote the
interests of the legal profession has spread sufficiently of
late to become an obstacle to the continuance of these abuses,
exceptional though they be. Hereafter such law schools as
receive students indiscriminately, without particular regard
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME.
to their educational standing, maintaining a loose system of
instruction and permitting loose methods of study, with
possibly a promise of graduation in one or two years, must
in most States, at any rate, suffer the humiliation incident
to the rejection as incompetent of their graduates by the •
examining boards designated to pass upon the qualifications
of applicants for admission to the bar. This movement is-
salutary in all respects, and law schools that fail to conform
to it in the duration and thoroughness of their courses of
instruction have no valid claim upon the approval of the
profession, the patronage of students or the confidence of
the public.
It is becoming more difficult year by year successfully to
meet the requirements and pass the examinations prescribed
for admission to the bar, and law schools are bound to take
cognizance of the fact and correspondingly broaden and
strengthen their courses of instruction. A few years ago it
was far less difficult than it is at present to enter the ranks
of the profession, and the decided tendency is to make
even more exacting the test of qualifications for membership.
With this tendency uninterrupted, the profession gives
promise of attaining to its coveted ideal in learning, ethics
and efficiency.
And here it may be in order to refer more particularly to
THE SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTION
in the Taw Department of the University of Notre Dame,
although, of course, it is included in general terms in what
has been stated regarding the duty of law schools to aid in
promoting the laudable aims and general welfare of the
legal profession.
Referring briefly to the prevailing methods of instruction
in the different law schools, it may be stated that in some of
them the text-book system is exclusively followed, and the
134
UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.
students read and recite daily an assigned lesson of a given
number of pages; in others the lecture system obtains, as in
European universities, and students familiar with phonog-
raphy may take notes and sufficiently study the same to be
able in subsequent examinations to answer questions bear-
ing upon the subjects studied; in a few others the study
of cases, or case reading, is the favored system, and students
read books of selected cases treating of different branches
of the law, with a view to reciting them in outline or writ-
ing a brief digest of the points involved; in certain other
schools an effort has been made to combine some of the
distinctive features of case reading, text-book work and
lecturing, and a mixed or- eclectic system, as it may be
called, exists in them. At Notre Dame, however, none of
these systems is exclusively followed, although there is a
nearer approach to the last than to any of the others. With
careful discrimination, the best features of all are comprised
in the curriculum here preferred. It is believed, in short,
that nowhere in the country is the law course more com-
prehensive, thorough and practical than at this University.
The study of cases is usually taken up early in September
year by year, and continued long enough to enable students
to understand, analyze and criticize the decisions assigned
to them for study and recitation. The difficulties usually
encountered by beginners in the work are readily sur-
mounted by the aid of lectures and explanations. In a
comparatively short time students become familiar with a
number of the leading cases and learn to recognize features
of strength or weakness in the opinions of the courts. They
learn also to distinguish dicta from the logical sequence of
thought in dealing with the proper subjects of judicial
determination, and recognize promptly the qualifying or
weakening effect of a dissenting opinion, where such is filed
by a minority of the judges. Moreover, after thus familiar-
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME.
135
izing themselves with cases, they are advised and expected
to read the authorities cited daily in class, whether in the
text-books, lectures, or quizzes. In the preparation also of
written theses from mouth to mouth, comprising on an
average ten or twelve pages of legal cap, they must nec-
essarily consult and cite them. In moot-court work like-
wise they are prompted and emulously incited in their
foretaste of forensic contests to make a careful study not
only of the cases in the reports, but also of the pertinent
portions of text-books, digests, etc., and thus they are
enabled intelligently to marshal the authorities upon which
they depend for success in the maintenance of their respec-
tive contentions.
In examinations for admission to the bar the courts of
some States require applicants to furnish lists of the text-
books they studied, and such of these applicants as have
merely attended lectures or studied cases, instead of reading
text-books, encounter danger of being declared ineligible to
stand as candidates for examination, even though they
might creditably acquit themselves in it. If they undertake
to explain how the law may be learned without studying a
certain number of text-books, they find the examiners
inclined to listen incredulously, if not openly and positively
to express doubt. And if they ask credit for the work
done, it is likely to be given so sparingly as to cause dis-
appointment and discouragement. As some of the law
students at Notre Dame come from States in which this
test is applied in examinations, the use of text-books
is deemed advisable, if not necessary. But there are
other reasons for using them. It has been found, for
example, that so' many mistakes are made by the aver-
age student in committing lectures to writing that his
notes are sometimes unintelligible or misleading, and
consequently practically worthless for future reference.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
136
While it is true that this objection might be over-
come by resorting to the slow, if not tedious, process of
dictation, yet this method of instruction would manifestly
be impracticable under present conditions in a domain so
extenive as the law. Moreover, the books used by students
become peculiarly available in their subsequent practice.
Remembering more or less clearly the contents, they can
turn more readily than they could with books they had not
studied to the pages that elucidate the questions with which
they may afterwards have to deal at the instance of courts,
clients and opposing counsel. In some law schools lectures
have been taken in full by certain students skilled in
pronography, and then typewritten and sold at so much a
page to other members of the class, but this practice has
fallen into disfavor and disuse, having proved to be very
unsatisfactory and more costly than the purchase of text-
books.
The lecture or dictation system alone may be pronounced
antiquated and impracticable for the reasons already stated,
but in combination with text-book work, case reading and
daily examinations, its great value and practical utility can-
not be overestimated. At Notre Dame it forms an important
factor in the law curriculum. Bach subject is fully covered
by lectures, text-book work, daily and bi-monthly examina-
tions, monthly theses, the reading of pertinent cases and
formal trials in the moot and other courts of the University.
This course of instruction is comprehensive, thorough,
and practical. It cannot be excelled. It may be stated
without qualification or reserve that the earnest and indus-
trious student can accomplish twice as much in a given
time at Notre Dame as he can in an office or at home.
With comparative immunity from the distractions and
temptations of city life, he can give his entire time to study
and necessary recreation. In short', he can here study a

greater number of hours and do more class-work day by day
than probably anywhere else in the entire country.
The authorities of the University, it may be repeated, are
sincerely in sympathy with the efforts now making in
educational and legal circles to raise to the highest plane
practicable
THE STANDARD OF PROFICIENCY
for graduation in law and admission to the bar. However,
they aim to be guided in the matter by the dictates of com-
mon sense. They know that a great number of worthy and
capable young men who desire to qualify themselves for the
legal profession are prevented by circumstances from com-
pleting the studies of a collegiate course before an age that
seems to make imperative the obligation of beginning with-
out delay the study of law. Such young men, many of
whom may be actively engaged in business, in teaching, in
journalistic work, and the like, are almost necessarily driven
to the chaotic and discouraging study of the law in offices,
if denied indulgent consideration by the institutions of
higher learning.
It is conceived to be the duty of a university to do all the
good it can to as many as possible, consistently with its cur-
riculum and standing; and to that end it ought to aid and
encourage, to the full limit of its opportunities, worthy and
upright, honest and capable young men who manifest an
earnest desire to qualify themselves for a useful and credit-
able career in the higher walks of professional life. With a
view to doing its full share in this regard, the University
of Notre Dame will welcome to its halls and its classes every
deserving young man who desires to pursue and become
proficient in the study of the law. However, if his standing
in collegiate work or general education be not sufficiently
advanced to enable him to undertake with profit the studies
138	UNIVERSITY or NOTRE DAME.
of the Junior year in law, he may enter the Elementary
class, the members of which are given instruction in the
fundamental principles of the law for an hour each day.
The remainder of his time is devoted to study and recitation
in such of the collegiate courses as, in the opinion of the
authorities, may prove most useful and helpful in qualifying
him to enter as speedily as practicable upon the studies of
the Junior and Senior law classes.
A faithful discharge of the duties devolving upon the
students of these classes demands their entire time. Every
hour of the day can be devoted profitably to the work
assigned to them. Even the Postgraduate students, whose
time is devoted exclusively to law work, find it suf-
ficient to keep them very busy. And yet it seems that, in
an indulgent spirit, an exception ought to be made in the
interest of such students as by previous study in other law
schools, or law offices, or actual practice as attorneys, have
acquired the right to be credited with work acceptably done,
or advanced standing in the course. It is deemed only fair
and proper to allow such as these to take electively any
additional studies they may choose in the regular or special
courses of the University. But this option may not be
exercised without permission and reasonable assurance that
it will not interfere with the work prescribed for students
of the Law Department.
The rule requiring regularity in class attendance is
imperative. Once students enter a class they are expected
to remain in it for the session at least, faithfully performing
the duties it imposes upon them. They may thus, by
coming to Notre Dame to complete their legal studies,
materially add to their attainments in any other branches
of knowledge likely to be helpful to them in their practice
as lawyers.
This fact tends pertinently to illustrate the special advan*

tages to be derived from studying law at a university.
There the educational atmosphere is elevating, broadening,
invigorating. It awakens a wholesome spirit of emula-
tion. It encourages the exercise of all the faculties and
intellectual powers. It serves as a potent and salutary
force in the development of mind and body. The impressive
lesson it inculcates relative to the past, the'present and the
future—the manifold duties of life—necessarily directs the
thoughtful to paths of knowledge and usefulness. It
awakens life-directing forces that else would perhaps ever
lie dormant. It tends to turn thought and action toward
high ideals, the acquisition of useful knowledge, sturdy
self-reliance and a strong sense of moral obligation in the
consciousness of increasing power and influence at the bar.
Students who do not intend to become candidates for the
degree of LT. B., but wish simply to add to their educa-
tional acquirements a knowledge of the
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW
may at any time during the year have their names enrolled
on the list of students in the Blementary class. No extra
expense is thereby incurred. However, such students must
be sufficiently advanced in age and education to justify the
belief that they can understand and appreciate instruction
in the law.
The number of such students is likely to increase steadily,
for year by year it is becoming more manifest that an edu-
cation is not complete without a knowledge of at least the
elementary principles of the law. Many a man in trade has
had to face financial ruin on account of want of acquaintance
with the fundamental legal principles. Although in theory,
at least, every person is presumed to know the law, yet many
a man has, by an inconsiderate act, due to his ignorance of
it, forfeited claim to the protection of the courts and the

to do exactly the contrary of what he intended through his
failure to understand the essential elements of a contract.
Many a one has been compelled to pay heavy damages for
personal injuries caused by negligence, or failure to perform
a duty, or improper performance of it, where no liability
would exist if the law of torts had been known and
observed. As the law is over and around every creature
from the first moment of his being until the grave closes
upon him and his estate is settled, it would be impossible to
overestimate its vital interest and importance. Indeed,
there is no study that can at all compare with it in practical
utility, in training the mind to accuracy of observation, in
strengthening the judgment and in imparting to the
faculties the power of discernment implied in what may
be called common sense.
A period of three years is prescribed for under-graduates
in the
COURSE OF STUDY
in the Law Department of this University. It leads when
satisfactorily completed to the degree of LU. B. The Post-
graduate course comprises an additional or fourth year, and
leads to the degree of LU- M. By its charter this Uni-
versity is empowered to confer these and all other degrees
appertaining to the courses of study in educational institu-
tions of the highest rank. There is no university that has
greater power under the law in this respect.
The under-graduate law students are divided into three
classesp^corresponding to each year of the course leading to
the degree of EE. B. They are known respectively as the
Elementary, Junior and Senior classes.^ The Postgraduate
course is for students who have received that degree and
aim at attaining by further study and practical work to a
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	141
higher order of proficiency. A full year of study in each
class is obligatory. Moreover, the student must pass a
satisfactory general examination at the close of each scho-
lastic year. This test is indispensable as a condition of
promotion in the Elementary and Junior classes and as
evidence of qualifications for graduation in the Senior class.
The subjects of study and the work to be done in each
class are here briefly outlined :
ELEMENTARY CLASS-FIRST YEAR.
An hour daily is given to instruction, recitation and work
in the class-room during the first year. The class-room,
commodious and well appointed, is in the main building.
The regular course of instruction consists in text-book work,
lectures, quizzes, written exercises and attendance at moot-
court trials and society meetings. The books primarily
used are Blackstone's and Kent's Commentaries. Other
works of elementary law are also used, as occasion may
require. Such are chosen as seem best adapted and most
available for purposes of instruction. Of these mention
may be made of Walker's American Law, Smith's Elemen-
tary Law, Munson's Elementary Practice, Keener's Selec-
tions on Jurisprudence, Holland's Elements of Jurisprudence,
Robinson s Elements of American Jurisprtidence, Fishback's
Manual of Elementary Law, and the like. The recently
published edition of Blackstone's Commentaries by Dr.
William Draper Lewis, is justly regarded as the best and
most complete known to the profession, although the
chart feature of Blickenderfer's Abridgment of Blackstone is
much appreciated by students. Browne's Blackstone, too,
is a carefullj7 prepared summary in one volume of the
essential elements of the original work. Browne's Edition
of Kent's Commentaries is also a useful summary in one
volume of the original treatise. However, it is usually
142	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
safer for students to purchase their books after joining the
class. Uniformity is thus assured, as well as lowest current
prices. This suggestion applies not only to the Elementary
students, but also to the Juniors and Seniors.
Persons who desire to become members of the Elementary
class must be at least eighteen years of age and entitled to
collegiate standing in their general education. However,
ample opportunity is afforded them to pursue such additional
studies as may seem useful in preparing for a successful
career in the law. For example, a knowledge of Latin,
Logic, History, Political Economy, and the like, would be
helpful to them. Other subjects also, in which they may
either regard themselves as deficient or wish to excel, may
likewise be entered on their lists of studies. Should it be
deemed necessary or advisable for them to perfect them-
selves in these studies, whether one year or several years be
requisite, it would be entirely practicable meanwhile to
attend the exercises of the Elementary class. Work thus
done would necessarily serve to broaden and deepen the
foundation of subsequent work in the Junior and Senior
years, making it peculiarly effective and promising. The
work done in this class is exceptionally interesting and
instructive for beginners, and there is sufficient change in
it annually to sustain interest and make attendance
profitable,- though continued for two or more years.
JUNIOR CLASS—SECOND YEAR.
When a student enters this class his close attention, and
earnest thought, and best efforts must be directed exclus-
ively to the study of law. He must attend class exercises
at least three hours daily. This he must do for the entire
scholastic year. Otherwise he cannot be regarded as en-
titled to promotion to the Senior class. He must do the
UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.
143
full work of the year if he would advance with his. class
and share its honors.
If the student be a collegiate Postgraduate in the Classics,
Sciences, Letters, or the like, or has attained to equivalent
acquirements and standing by work and experience in
professional pursuits, or lines of thought and study kindred
to the law, he may be eligible primarily to membership in
this class. In such case it would be necessary for him to
undertake and perform the most essential work of the
Elementary class in addition to his other duties. The
practicability of the undertaking may be inferred from the
fact that it is sought to do in this class fully the work of a
year and a half, as gauged by the courses of other educa-
tional institutions. That this has been done in many
instances cannot be doubted, although there has never been
Special reference to any other institution, with a view to
comparison, or as an incentive to exceptional effort. Pre-
sumably the result is due to a progressive system of instruc-
tion, more recitations daily, a greater number of hours for
Study and the purpose of each member of the Faculty to
do his best in the performance of duty. But, notwith-
standing these facts, it is necessary for many of the students,
no matter how well advanced or finished their education, to
take the full course of three years. The fact that they
might accomplish in tw-o years all that is ordinarily done in
three, makes no difference. This is due to the action of
courts and legislatures in many of the States. A rule has
been established requiring three years of actual study of
the law as a prerequisite to applying for admission to the
bar. Persons from these States must take the full three
years’ course, including the Elementary class. However,
if their general education be finished, and it seem super-
fluous to do further collegiate work, they may select in
preference the Junior, Senior and Postgraduate years as
144	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
covering the time required for study in the States in which
they intend to practice. Of course, this question will not
arise in States that require only two years of study, and
students from such States who are entitled to postgraduate
standing ought to be able to do in two years the ordinary
work of three, and thus qualify themselves in that time to
undergo without difficulty the most rigorous examination
for admission to the bar.
In arranging the course of study it is sought to take
subjects in their logical sequence. The less difficult, though
by no means the less important, come in the Junior year,
while the more technical are dealt with in the Senior year,
except in the case of Pleadings and Bvidence. A knowl-
edge of these renders moot court work intelligible and
profitable to an exceptional degree, and hence they enter
into the plan of instruction in the Junior year. The moot
court practice is an important factor in the course of instruc-
tion for all the classes, and there can be no question regard-
ng the advisability of learning and applying the rules of
pleading and evidence at as early a date as practicable.
Following are the chief subjects of study in the Junior year
and the names of some of the authors of text-books dealing
with them:

Reading and Statutory Constuction.

ever, receive due attention and are fully explained. And it
may be stated that, with a view to enabling students to
obviate the expense of purchasing many book, subjects of
brief compass are taught, as may seem practicable, by means
of lectures, case reading, quizzes, theses and moot court
trials. But should text-books be preferred at any time,
resort may be had to their use.
SENIOR CLASS—THIRD YEAR*
So much of what has been stated with reference to the
preceding classes is applicable also to students of the Senior
year that it will be unnecessary to enlarge on the nature of
their work. A detailed description of it might involve
repetition to some extent, and thus become tedious. Those
eligible to membership are such as have satisfactorily
finished the studies of the first and second years and earned
the right to promotion. However, in compliance with a
custom generally recognized by the leading universities,
lawyers in good standing who desire to join the class, in
order to broaden and systematize their knowledge of the
law, are also admitted to it. On passing a satisfactory
examination at the end of the year they become, like other
students, entitled to the degree of IX. B. And the same
courtesy is extended to students of good moral character
who have acceptably finished the work of two years in law
schools or law departments of other universities. The
leading subjects of study, together with the names of -the
authors of some of the text-books treating of them, are
here presented:

The subdivisions of the principal subjects indicated in the
preceding list are, of course, included in the general' terms
designating those subjects, and it is unnecessary specially to
enumerate them. Tor example it would be superflous to
refer specifically to Arbitration, Demand, Bstoppel, Injunc-
tion, Insolvency, Notice, Protest, Assessment, Taxation,
Mandamus, Quo Warranto, Ultra Vires, Recoupment, Set-
148	UNIVERSITY or notre dam®.
off, Counterclaim, Debtor and Creditor, and the like, tor
they are carefully considered and fully explained in con-
nection with the broader subjects to which they relate. ,
The subjects of study are not necessarily taken, one by
one, in consecutive order, as given in the list. Three or
four of them may engage the attention and demand the
work of the class at the same time. To illustrate: The class
meets for recitation three or four times daily—say once or
twice in the forenoon and twice in the afternoon. Inter-
national Taw may be chosen for the morning hour, special
work in office business or court practice afterward, Con-
stitutional Taw the first hour in the afternoon and Municipal
or Private Corporations later. Once a subject is chosen for
a particular class, whether first, second, third or fourth in
the daily routine, it is continued exclusively in the same
class, without break or interruption, until finished. The
special work indicated consists in conveyancing, preparation
of pleadings, the manner of taking appeals and office busi-
ness generally. It is intended more particularly for the
Seniors and Postgraduates. The Senior students are
expected to devote approximately twenty hours a week to
recitations or class work.
By the system outlined in the foregoing paragraph it is
sought to keep each subject before the mind of the student
until he firmly grasps and 'understands it. Thus it
becomes distinctively and permanently fixed in the mind-
The practice of teaching to the same class one subject one
day, another the next, and still another the day following,
as where non-resident professors, each with a different sub-
ject, follow daily one the other, finds no encouragement at
Notre Dame. Such blending of subjects and intermingling
of principles manifestly tend to confusion of thought and
chaos of subject-matter. It is admittedly very difficult in
such case to comprehend and understand the law as a
UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.
149
symmetrical whole — a system majestic and beautiful in its
harmonious entirety.
POSTGRADUATE COURSE—FOURTH YEAR.
Only graduates in law are admitted to this course. But
these may be from any other university in good standing,
as well as from our own Law Department. A year can
very profitably be given to the work prescribed for gradua-
tion in it. The degree conferred is that of Master of Laws.
The work of this course is eminently practical and of the
greatest possible utility to those who intend to engage in
the practice of the profession on their own account at an
early date, and not to give two or three years of probation
to the drudgery of a clerkship at small salary in some office.
Kvery year of study greatly increases the interest of the
student in the law and his power to understand it. If
bright and industrious, he ought to do as much effective
work while a Senior as he did during the two preceding
years, and his capacity to learn ought to increase in corre-
sponding ratio in the Postgraduate course. By working
earnestly and devotedly during the year he can review the
studies of the preceding three years and confidently reach
out in other directions to acquire additional knowledge.
The nature of his work and the subjects of his study may be
briefly indicated :
Study of the Statutes and System of Pleadings of his State,
Practice in taking Depositions.
Frequent Participation in Moot Court Trials,
Arguments on Motions for New Trials.
Preparation of Bills of Exceptions, Briefs, Records and
Abstracts of Records in Appeals.
The Framing of Arguments for a Rehearing.
Duties of Masters in Chancery, Referees and Arbitrators.
Duties of Assignees and Receivers; also, of Public Officers.

Deeds, Mortgages, Leases, etc., in Conveyancing.
A Critical Study of Pleadings, with Reference to Forms and
Substance.
furisdiction of the Federal Courts.
The Roman Law and Comparative furisprudence.
The exercises of the class in office work are attended not
only by the students of the Postgraduate course, but also by
the Seniors. Prom a practical point of view, these exercises
are highly important, and the change in them annually is
sufficient to suggest novelty and make them highly interest-
ing and instructive to the students of succeeding years, as
where Seniors finish the Postgraduate course. This work
includes the examination of abstracts of title, practical
examples in conveyancing, a critical study of the different
forms of pleadings and the general business of a successfully
conducted law office. While even one year of study in this
class is admittedly very helpful, if not actually necessary,
yet the benefits and advantages that accrue from attending
a second year cannot well be overestimated.
THE COMMON LAW
is taught primarily at Notre Dame. This is the law gener-
ally prevailing throughout the Union—the law that obtains
in the States. It addresses itself to almost all the relations
of life. In fact, about nineteen out of every twenty cases
tried in our courts are decided in accordance with its princi-
ples. ilt is generally uniform in its operation. However,
the statutory enactments of State legislatures overcome and
displace it, so far as they conflict with its provisions. These
enactments differ materially in the different States, owing ,
to unlike conditions and local differences. Thus it is that
the laws of certain States are so radically unlike the laws of
other States. Of course, there are instances in which
UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.	151
statutes are passed to cover acts and conditions not provided
for by the common law ; but in most instances the existing
statutes simply declare, qualify or render inoperative some
of its rules.
In view of these facts, thorough instruction is here given
in the common law. Neither lawyers nor judges pretend to
know the statutes of any other State than of that in which
they practice or preside. In fact, a knowledge of the stat-
utes of different States would be more confusing and bewil-
dering than profitable to judges, lawyers and students.
Moreover, they are liable to be radically changed from time
to time by legislative bodies representing diverse political
interests and opinions. In an examination for admission to
the bar of this or any other State, no question is put and
nothing is said relative to the statutes of sister States. In
fact, the States are treated as foreign to one another in law.
There are, however, certain fundamental statutory enact-
ments that exist without material diversity in their scope
and purpose in almost all the States. Again, other statutes
somewhat less important and fundamental in character exist
in groups of States. Such statutes as these may be profit-
ably studied in class, in connection with the common law ;
but it would be worse than useless for a student to attempt
to investigate and study the mazes of statutory differences
in the several States. Hence, it is suggested as advisable
Tor each of the Senior and Postgraduate students to procure
and have with him for independent study when he comes
in September a copy of the revised statutes of his State or
of the State in which he intends to practice.
GRADUATES
of the Law Department have met with exceptional success,
it has been noted, in passing examinations for admission to
the bar, Nevertheless, it may be in point to state that it
152
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
ought hereafter to be comparatively easy for them to meet
the requirements of the severest tests in that line, in view
of the increase in the number of daily recitations and the
lengthening of the period of instruction. By way of show-
ing the full accord and co-operation of the Faculty in that
regard with the bar and the bench of the country, attention
may be drawn to the following authoritative expression on
the subject, which is embodied in a resolution passed by the
American Bar Association in 1897:
“Resolved, That the American Bar Association approves the
lengthening of the course of instruction in law schools to a period of
three years, and that it expresses the hope that as soon as practicable
a rule may be adopted in each State, which will require candidates
for admission to the bar to study law for three years before applying
for admission.”
It would certainly be disappointing now to meet a gradu-
ate timid at the prospect of an examination. With the
right spirit and proper training, he ought to face it cheer-
fully and unhesitatingly. However, the Supreme Court of
Indiana has adopted a rule providing for the admission of
graduates of this Department on motion, or without exami-
nation. Under this rule they may, being voters, present
themselves before the Judges of the Court, exhibit their
diplomas, and, on motion of some attorney, followed by the
administration to them of the oath of office, be admitted by
proper order to the bar, receiving the certificates of licensed
attorneys, and having their name inscribed on the “roll of
honor” of the Court. This contains the names of those
who furnish evidence of having satisfactorily finished the
Study of law before applying for admission to the bar.
Recently, too, the Board of Examiners of Wisconsin ac-
credited our Law Department as on an equality in the
matter of thoroughness with that of their State University,
and the law graduates of Notre Dame may now be admitted

153
to the bar of that State on presentation of their diplomas
to the Board for indorsement.
° THE LAW DEBATING SOCIETY
holds its meetings on Saturday evenings. All students of
the Department are members of it. They are required,
each in his turn, to participate in its debates and other
exercises. The debates commonly deal with questions
germane to the law. However, subjects of history, political
economy, and the like, are also in favor. An excellent
opportunity is afforded at the meetings of the society to
develop skill, power and fluency in public speaking. The
graces of the elocutionist and the persuasive powers of the
orator may here be cultivated and strengthened. All can
increase in force and fluency of thought and expression by
attending regularly and participating in the exercises of this
society. Officers are elected twice yearly by the students
themselves. They select also a competent critic to note
the mistakes made in pronunciation or otherwise by the
speakers at each meeting, and to read a carefully prepared
paper correcting the same at the meeting following. A
Professor presides, aids the members by his counsel and
suggestions, and decides the questions under discussion on
the merits of the arguments.
THE LAW LIBRARY
adjoins and communicates directly with the Lecture Room,
in Sorin Hall. Students have uninterrupted access to it at
all reasonable hours. They may frequent it as often as they
choose for the purpose of studying cases, preparing for
moot court trials, finding authorities for their monthly
theses, referring to the cases cited in the text - books and
lectures, or reading the standard treatises Kvery decision
rendered for many years by the State, Territorial and
Federal courts may here be found, Consequently, not to
154
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAMS.
repeat other reasons already stated, students are not
required to purchase as many law books as they are obliged
to have in other places. The books in the library may be
used by the law students in common as freely as can reason-
ably be wished, and without charge. The same is true in
respect to the vast collection of miscellaneous books in the
Lemonnier Library. Taw books may be taken from the
library to the Lecture Room for use in moot court trials,
but must afterward be returned. All students have an
equal right to use them, being as it were tenants-in com-
mon in that regard; but any disposition to invade the
common right, whether through selfishness or thoughtless-
ness, by attempting to make exclusive use of them, as in
placing them under cover in desks or taking them to private
rooms, must be vigilantly guarded against and impartially
discountenanced. Students have an undoubted right to
expect that when they need any particular book they can
find it in the Library, and not be compelled to lose valuable
time in making inquiry or searching for it elsewhere.
No discrimination is made between law students and
students of the regular collegiate courses in the matter of
EXPENSES,
The fee for tuition, board, lodging, washing, mending,
etc., is fixed at $300 for the scholastic year. This covers
all real necessaries, and, considering the excellent accommo-
dations at Notre Dame, is believed to be very reasonable.
It is said that students elsewhere must pay from $400 to
$500 a year for like services and accommodations. The
cost of books may be estimated approximately at $7 for the
first year and $20 each for the second and third years.
Students have but little occasion or opportunity to spend
money or to cultivate expensive habits; for they study,
board and lodge at the University, in an atmosphere favor-

able to earnest work, and quite apart from the associations
and temptations incident to city life. Terms of payment
and other pertinent information may be found elsewhere
in this catalogue, under the general caption ‘ ‘ Expenses. ’ ’
It may, perhaps, be well to anticipate possible inquiries by
stating that no additional charge is made for attending
or becoming students of classes in the collegiate courses.
DISCIPLINE,	'
The Taw students, as well as all others, are expected to
be earnest and industrious in the performance of the duties
devolving upon them, and to secure this end and the fullest
possible utilization of time the same rules of discipline
apply to all the students. These rules require promptitude
and regularity in class attendance, uprightness in conduct
and manliness in deportment. Obedience to them tends to
’strengthen character, establish wholesome habits and
nourish in heart and mind the qualities that mark the
true gentleman and persevering scholar, the honored citizen
and successful lawyer, the independent thinker and firm
believer in the illimitable possibilities of industry, per-
severance and self-reliance to win the crown of illustrious
achievements in the domain of life.

COMMERCIAL COURSE

This Course can be completed in two years. It includes
arithmetic, grammar, letter-writing, geography, United
States history, reading, orthography, penmanship, book-
keeping, Commercial Law—in other words, all the branches
of a complete business education.
When the character and needs of the country are con-
sidered, this Course will appear the most practical, and one
of the most important that an educational institution can
afford.
Those, therefore, who have not the time or means to take
a complete college course in the Classics and Sciences-
would do well to enroll themselves in the Commercial
Course. No plan of study is more injudicious than a hap-
hazard selection of such studies as an inexperienced young
man may fancy. The training resulting from a fixed course
of studies is of the utmost benefit to the student.
The Commercial Course at Notre Dame has always
received the most careful attention from the officers and the
Commercial Faculty of the University. Notre Dame claims
to give the graduates of this Course a more complete business
training than can be obtained in any purely commercial
college. Believing that a business education includes some-
thing more than a mere knowledge of book-keeping, and
that a good education cannot be obtained in a few weeks,
the authorities have extended this Course over two years—
the shortest time in which studies necessarily used in busi-
ness life can be mastered. Should a pupil desire during
this period to pursue any other studies in which he may be

interested, and for which he has time, he will have liberty
to do so.
General History and linear Drawing are especially
recommended to commercial students. They also have an
opportunity of attending an elementary course of the Physi-
cal and Natural Sciences. Many commercial students find
it also to their advantage to keep up the study of German or
French, for which there are the amplest facilities. A tal-
ented and studious young man may thus in the course of
two years find himself in the possession of a most valuable
practical education, which will fit him to take his place in
the front rank of educated business men.

UNIVERSITY ON NOTRE DAME.
MINIM DEPARTMENT.
For the care and training of boys under the age of thir-
teen years, there has been established a department to which
the most scrupulous attention has always been paid by the
college authorities: it is known as the Minim' Department.
Thorough and comprehensive instruction in all the ele-
mentary branches of an English education is here imparted,
together with a rudimentary knowledge of Isatin, French
and German. Vocal Music and Drawing Course no extra
charge. The pupils of this department are taught by Sisters
of the Holy Cross.
DISCIPLINE.
The following is the order of the day: Rising at 6:40 a. m.,
toilet, etc.; seven, breakfast, after which there is a short
time given for exercises on the campus; half-past seven,
study; half-part nine, luncheon; ten, study; a quarter to
twelve, toilet; twelve, dinner, followed by recreation; half-
past one, study; half-past three, recreation and luncheon;
half-past six, supper and recreation; half-past eight, retiring,
brom this it may be seen that while the Minims devote less
:han six hours a day to study, there are never more than
two hours in succession in the class-room. The recreation
md exercise in the fresh air between each two hours of
study, unbend the mind and prepare the boys to return to
their classes refreshed and ready for work.
UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.	167
The Minims are always under supervision, during the
hours of recreation as well as in the class-room and study-
hall. The presence, however, of the Prefect is far from
being a restraint on the amusement of the boys; for while it
is the duty of the Prefects to insist that their young charges
shall always keep within the limits of the strictest propriety,
they, at the same time, take part in all sports, organize
games, and do everything in their power to foster the love
of exercises. The play-ground is a broad, level, five-
acre field, well supplied with turning poles, swings, ladders,
rings, parallel-bars, and all other necessary gymnastic appar-
atus. That the boys make good use of them can be seen
from their healthy, happy appearance, which invariably
attracts the notice of visitors. Connected with the play-
ground is a brick play-hall, 160 feet long and heated by
steam. In this hall the boys play in rainy or cold weather.
The Sisters preside at the toilet; they clean and mend the
clothing; see to all the needs and to the comfort and con-
venience of the Minims. Baths are taken every few days.
Underclothing is changed regularly. Great care is taken
that the boys be neatly dressed, and that the clothing be
suitable for the season.
SOCIETIES.
There are two societies in the Minim department; that of
the Guardian Angels of the Sanctuary, which has for its
object to supply servers for the Church offices; and the Sorin
Association, which has been established with a view to give
the pupils a start, as early as possible, in elocution. The
society is presided over by one of the professors, who find it
a pleasant duty to draw out the talent of these interesting
young orators. Meetings are held once a week, after school
hours. These meetings are a source of pleasure as well as
i68
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME.
of profit. The members prepare original compositions,
deliver declamations, are trained to debate, etc. Only the
best behaved and more advanced in studies are admitted to
membership. To encourage this young Literary Society, a
. Gold Medal is annually awarded at Commencement for
Elocution to the most deserving member.
GENERAL REMARKS.
The discipline to which the minims are subjected is much
milder than that which is suited to students more advanced
in age. Recourse is scarcely ever had to punishment
Those in charge endeavor to govern by kindness and
gentleness, and by appealing to the boys’ sense of honor.
The names of all whose conduct and application to studies
are satisfactory appear under the heads of Roll of Honor
and Class Honors. To find his name mentioned in these
rolls, is found to be as great a reward for the deserving
pupil, as its non-appearance is a punishment for the
undeserving.
Then, too, there is a Gold Medal awarded at the end of
two full years to those whose deportment has been unex-
ceptionable during that period. As this fact is made known
to the Minim immediately after his entrance, he generally
endeavors to shape his conduct with a view to receiving an
“Honor.” The greatest care is taken to form their young
hearts to habits of virtue, and to inculcate the practice of
refined manners. Every effort is made to foster respect and
affection for parents, to whom they are expected to write at
least once a week.
Not the least of the advantages enjoyed by the Minims,
is ther> complete separation from the larger students.
A commodious building known as St. Edward’s Hall,
affording ample accomodations for over one hundred
pupils, is devoted to their use. It is four stories in height,
UNIVERSITY OR NOTRE DAME.
169
one hundred and fifty feet long, and forty-five feet wide;
heated by steam, supplied throughout with the Bdison
incandescent electric light, and provided with hot and cold
water. The ceilings in the Study-Hall, Class-Rooms and
sleeping apartments are fifteen feet high. The windows
are large and numerous, affording abundant light and venti-
lation. The Study-Hall commands a charming view from
each of its eleven large windows. It is tastefully decorated
with statuary, pictures, plants, etc. Beside the pleasure
the Minims derive from studying in this bright, cheerful
hall, their tastes are cultured by coming in contact with
objects so refining. Fronting the building is a handsome
park, which, with its fountains, rare trees and flowers,
add not a little to the beauty of St. Bdward’s Hall as
well as to the happiness of its inmates.
These remarks, which have been made to satisfy parents
and others who frequently write for more detailed informa-
tion, will show that, while the Minims have every possible
advantage to aid them in acquiring a foundation for future
study, they have a home, where they enjoy the same ease
and freedom that they would enjoy under the care of their
mothers.	.

NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
Visitors to Notre Dame judge from the appearance of the
buildings and grounds that the University has no need of
money. It is, nevertheless, absolutely without endowment,
and its work is seriously hampered because it has no resourses
except the fees of the students. There is one scholarship,
and the interest from this foundation is used in educating
and boarding a student.
There were last year 1,452 Catholic students in 6 per
centum of the non-Catholic colleges of America, and very
many of these will lose their faith, and all will be weakened
in that faith, because our people look upon Collegiate Insti-
tutions as the property of private* corporations which are to.
be left to take care of themselves.
Notre Dame asks for scholarships for boys that can not
pay the expense of education, and who therefore are obliged
to go to non-Catholic Colleges to the detriment of their
faith. A foundation of $5,000 will educate and board a
student as long as the University exists. As one bursar is
graduated another can take his place. The founder of the
scholarship, of course, always has the privilege of appoint-
ing the student.
We lack money for a library building, and for two more
dwelling-halls like Sorin Hall.
Two or three thousand dollars are required for finishing
and equipping the new gymnasium.
Foundations for scholarships are also a pressing need.
There is no library fund for the purchase of new books.

The Notre Dame Scholastic,
Is the title of a neat 28-page paper, devoted to the inter-
ests of the students, and published by them at the Uni-
versity every week during Term time. This journal opens
a field for young writers who might otherwise, for want of
a proper medium, allow their talents to remain inactive.
It also affords Students an opportunity for practical exper-
ience in journalism. During seasons of special interest at
the University, The Scholastic is published daily.
The Scholastic contains articles of an instructive literary
character, interesting Biographical Sketches, Essays, Poetry,
Notes on Art, Music, Science and literature, Notes of New
Publications, etc., etc.
In addition to its literary features, The Scholastic has
a special importance for students, their parents, and all who
have had classes at the University in times past, an account
of the weekly summary of events happening at Notre Dame,
personal Notices of former students, Rolls of Honor, Class
Honors, List of Excellence, etc., which appear in its col-
umns every week. Reports relative to the arrangement of
classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic
students, etc., also find a place in this paper and keep the
parents and others informed about matters that concern
their children and friends.
It will be the endeavor of the Editors during the coming
year to merit the encouragement given the paper in the past,
and the encomiums bestowed upon it by the press in general.
The Scholastic will be sent to any address for $1.50
per annum.
Address all communications to THE NOTRE DAME
SCHOLASTIC, Notre Dame, Indiana.
