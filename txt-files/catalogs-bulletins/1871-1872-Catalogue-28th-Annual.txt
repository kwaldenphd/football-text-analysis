^^^HE University was founded in 1842 by the Congregation of the
Holy Cross, and was chartered by the Legislature of. the State of
Indiana in 1844, with power to confer all the usual degrees.
The College Buildings are on an eminence, near two small, picturesque
lakes of pure spring water, in the midst of the fine and healthy farming
region of the St. Joseph Valley, and scarcely a mile from the river. The Col-
lege can easily be reached from all parts of the United States and Canada, by
means of two great trunk lines of Railway,---the Michigan Southern &
Northern Indiana, and the Michigan Central; the former passing within a
mile of the College grounds, and the latter connecting at Niles with the
recently built Railway between that place and South Bend, which runs within
half a mile of the College. At the Michigan Southern Railroad depot, South
Bend, omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained.
The Buildings are vzell adapted for the purpose for which they were
erected. The Study-Halls, Class-Rooms, Dining-Rooms, Sleeping Apartments,
anil Recreation Halls are commodious and capable of giving accommodation
to five hundred resident students.
THE SITE
•! of the College is one particularly adapted to the improvement of the students.
| It is secluded and healthy, and constant care is rendering a spot naturally
I beautiful still more attractive by art and good taste.
I We state only the advantages of
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT
that are enjoyed by the inmates of the Institutiona description of all that
pleases at Notre Dame would take us beyond the limits of these pages. We
prefer to give a hearty invitation to all our patrons, and. to all who think of
confiding their sons to our care, to come and see and judge for themselves.
The advantages arising from
THE RETIRED POSITION
of the College cannot fail to be appreciated by parents who have at heart the
education of their children; and even the careless student when once interested
in his studies soon finds out the benefits he can derive from an uninterrupted
attention to class and study. Though secluded in a great measure from the
busy world without, yet the number of Students and the extensive College
grounds give him a world of his own, in which, what with Class, Examination,

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	7
Notes, Literary Societies, Religious Associations, Base ball Clubs, Dramatic	I
and Musical Entertainments, he finds full enjoyment and amusement} and com-	!
panions, ideas and sentiments that all concur to fix his mind on his studies and i
establish him in habits of piety, application and order—the influence of which
will be felt his entire life. He breathes for a few short years the atmosphere ;
of order, of regularity in all that he does; of profound application to studies,
broken only by healthy and regular recreation; and certainly, in our times,
when serious and solid studies are becoming so rare, when all kinds of induce-
ments to waste and fritter away time are forced upon young Students, when !
morals are so lightly watched over, the advantage of the retired locality of
Notre Dame cannot be too highly spoken of.	i
Providence has singularly blessed the Institution in regard to health, and	j
those who have had their sons in the College can give their testimony that the	-
regular course of life, added to the salubrious climate, the fresh country air,
has done much to improve the health of their children.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
order and regularity. The morals and general deportment of the pupils are ,
assiduously watched over, and their comforts and personal habits receive the
same attention as if they were in the bosom of their own families.
REGULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
AU the Students are required to attend the exercises of public worship
with punctuality and decorum.
As soon as the bell announces the beginning or end of a College exercise,
every one shall repair in silence to the discharge of that duty to which he is
called.
The time of recreation excepted, silence must be inviolably observed in all j
places.	!
Students must show themselves obedient and respectful toward the Pro-t '
fessors and Prefects of the Institution—never absenting themselves from the j
place in which they ought to be, without permission from proper authority.	j
Students must carefully avoid every expression in the least injurious to	:
Religion, their Professors, Prefects or fellow-Students.	i
Students are not permitted to visit private rooms.	-I
The use of tobacco is strictly forbidden.	J
Intoxicating liquors are absolutely prohibited.	’	!

mission of the Director of Studies.	;
No one shall leave the University grounds without the permission of the )

Any breach of pure morals, either in words or actions, must be reported |
forthwith to the President or Vice-President.	|
No one shall keep in his possession any money, except what he receives
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
s weekly from the Treasurer, on Wednesdays, at nine o’clock a.m. The College
will not be responsible for any valuables, such as watches, money, etc., unless
deposited with the Secretary.
Bulletins are sent to parents every month.
On the first Wednesday of every month, “Certificates of Good Conduct”
and “ Improvement in Class ” are issued by the Faculty to such Students as
deserve them.
In the Refectory of the Senior Department, and also in that of the Junior,
conspicuous to the eyes of visitors, may be seen the “ Tables of Honor,” pre-
sided over by the Vice-President and Prefect of Discipline. At these are
seated twenty-two of the Students whose conduct has been the most exemplary
during the preceding week. They are elected by the unanimous vote of the
Professors and Prefects.
Bath-rooms, provided with hot and cold water, are fitted up for the use of
the Students during the winter. In warm weather, however, the Students
bathe twice a week in St. Joseph’s Lake.
Stationery, etc., will be delivered to Students, as follows: On Mondays
and Thursdays, at half-past twelve o’clock, to the Students of the Senior
Department; Wednesdays, at half-past seven a.xl, to the Students of the Junior
Department. Every Student should have a jnemorandum book in which to
enter all his receipts and expenditures, and his notes for recitation in class and
for conduct during his stay in college. Books prepared expressly for this pur-
pose can be obtained from the Secretary.
Students who have failed to give satisfaction in the Class-room, or who
shall have been guilty of misconduct or breach of rule, will be sent to the
| Detention-room during the recreations or the promenades, and required to
| prepare their lessons, or perform such tasks as shall be assigned them, and will
be excluded from all College exercises until such tasks be accomplished.
Senior Students will be permitted to read or study from eight to a quarter
i .to nine o’clock p. w.
Every month all the Students must write to their parents or guardians.
All letters sent or received may be opened by the President or Vice-President-
| When a Student is sick, he will obtain permission from the Prefect of
| Health to go to the Infirmary, where he must observe the regulations of the
• place until his recovery.
No book, periodical or newspaper shall be introduced into the College,
without being previously examined and approved by the Director of Studies.
Objectionable books found in the possession of Students will be withheld from
them until their departure from the University.
Whether in class or in recreation, when permitted to converse at table, or
during their walks, Students should endeavor to improve the purity of their
language, and cultivate urbanity of manners A few years in College would
be profitably employed, if nothing else were learned than to converse and
behave with the dignity and propriety of gentlemen.
i The happiness, no less than the improvement, of Students, is so closely
‘ connected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the College, that

no young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own welfare and the
accomplishment of his purpose in entering the Institution, can fail to discover
the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing Rules. If the authori-
ties of the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere and unwavering zeal in
keeping those Regulations, they demand of Students nothing more than the
promotion of their own interests.
GENERAL INFORMATION.
The Academic Year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
closes on the last Wednesday of June, when the Annual Commencement, the
Conferring of Degrees and Distribution of Premiums take place. It is divided
into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each Session, a
strict examination of all the different classes is made in the presence of the
Faculty.
When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is
examined by the Director of Studies, and placed in the class for which’ his
previous attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends
on his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be
found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such pro-
motion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully a
strict examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates
of the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary or
Scientific Studies.
The Degrees of LL.B, and LL.D., as also those of Bachelor of Science
and Master of Science, will be conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to the Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their good character.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the
Institution being natives of France and Germany, opportunities at all times
occur for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
All letters sent and received by Students may be opened and read by the
President or his substitute.	’
There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions and
By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the Archconfraternity,
St. Gregory’s Society, Holy Angels’, Holy Childhood, Philodemic, St. Ed-
ward’s, Thespian, St. Cecilia’s, and Philharmonic Societies, with which Stu-
dents are authorized and recommended to connect themselves.

LAW DEPARTMENT
All the branches necessary for a good legal education are included in the !
Course. The Code and Common Law systems of Pleading and Practice are	<
taught. The Course of Studies in this Department embraces, chiefly, Ethics;	'
Political Economy; Constitutional and International Law; Municipal Law; !
Law of Contracts; Equity Jurisprudence; Criminal Law; Evidence, Plead- |
ing and Practice.	j
In addition to the general course of instruction, Students will receive ■ [
every assistance in studying the Laws peculiar to their respective States.	*
The entire Course for those just commencing the study of Law, is in-
tended to be completed in two years, divided into four terms, which corres-
pond with those of the other Departments of the University.	i
Every applicant for admission into this Department is expected to have, i
at least, a complete English Education. It is very desirable that he should
also have a classical training before commencing the study of the Law ; never-	[
theless, those who may not possess this advantage, will, without extra charge,	i
be afforded ample facilities for acquiring a knowledge of the classics while	i
prosecuting their legal studies.	i
Students intending to follow the Law Course may enter at any time, but	|
it is more advisable and profitable for them to present themselves at the	j
beginning of a Term. ’	|
The Students will be required to pass through an examination at the I
close of each Term, and also to present an essay, of not more than seven pages	>
of legal cap, on some one of the matters which they shall have seen. The	|
notes of these special examinations and essays, as well as those of the applica-
tion and general standing of the members in class throughout the Law Course, '
will be placed to their respective credits in the result of the final examination
for the Degree of LL. B.	I
Without entering into details, the order of studies is substantially pre- j
sented under the following general headsI
First Term.
Nature and Divisions of Law; Ethics; Common Law and Pleadings;
Law of Contracts as to Personal Rights and Obligations.
Second Term.
International and Municipal Law; Constitutional Jurisprudence of the
United States; Law of Contracts, as to Personal Property; Pleading and
Practice.
Third Term.
Political Economy; Law of Evidence; Criminal Law; Pleading and '
Practice.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	15
Fourtlv Ttyrm.
Law of Real Property; Equity Jurisprudence and. Procedure. A gen-
eral review.
The hours for classes are, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays,
from 10 to 12 a. m., and from 2)^ to 3% p. m. ; on Saturdays, from 10 to 12
A. M.
Besides the ordinary prizes granted in the different classes, at the end of
each Collegiate Year there will also be two grand prizes, of $50.00 and $40.00
each, awarded respectively (subject to the rules and regulations of the Univer-
sity) to the best and second best treatise or discourse, as the case may be,
written by Students of the graduating class, on some subject chosen by the
Faculty, and which will be submitted in due time and form.
Students attending the Law Course will have the privilege of consulting
the library, but each one is requested to furnish himself with the leading text-
books which are generally used. All the works need not be procured at once,
but the Student can supply himself with those of more immediate application
as indicated by his Professor, from time to time, in the progress of the Course.
Among the text-books principally recommended are Kent’s Commentaries ;
Parson on Contracts; Colyer on Partnership ; Edwards on Bills of Exchange
and Promissory Notes ; Angell & Ames on Corporations; Bishop on Criminal
Procedure ; Chitty and Stephen on Pleading ; Washburne on Real Property ;
Greenleaf on Evidence; Burrill’s Law Dictionary; Story on Constitutional
Law; Story’s Equity Jurisprudence, and others which can be obtained as
needed. The usefulness of these works will not cease with the Student’s
career, but as they are standard authorities on most of the subjects of which
they treat, they will continue to be of service in subsequent practice. Hence
the desirability of procuring them as early as possible.
The authorities of the University have determined to spare nothing that
can be done by them to place the Law Department on a first-class footing;
and have in contemplation, as soon as circumstances will permit, the erection
of a separate building for the use of Students pursuing this Course.
The Students will be expected to conform to the rules of the University.
Further information may be obtained by addressing Veky Rev. W.
Cobby, S.S.C., President of the University.
MINIM DEPARTMENT.
In this Department are admitted young boys under ten years of age, who
are carefully taught—by highly competent lady Teachers—Spelling, Reading,
Writing, and the elements of English Grammar, Geography, History and
Arithmetic, so as to fit Them, after a lapse of time more or less extended, for
the higher branches of study.

This Department forms one of the three grand divisions of study in the ’
University. Candidates for graduation have to pass a satisfactory examination i
in each of the above branches. The routine of study in the Course of Book-	>
keeping embraces the following, the whole being completed in one scholastic	।
year:—Preparatory Instructions and Definitions; Initiatory Sets by Double
Entry—1st Series, Embracing the Buying and Selling of Merchandise on j
Private Account; 2d Series, On Account of others; 3d Series, Buying and \
Selling the same on Joint Account;- 4th Series, Importing and Exporting on ,
private account, on account of others, and on account of ourselves and others :
in company; 5th Series, Receiving and Forwarding Merchandise, the Manage-	I
ment and Settlement of Executors’ Accounts, Buying, Selling, Remitting, Col-	;
lecting, Discounting, Accepting and Paying Bills of Exchange, Banking—	i.
Private and Joint Stock—Steamboating; Railroading; Retailing by Double i
Entry; Farming; Mechanics’ Accounts,—the whole course illustrating the J
opening, conducting and closing of Stock and Partnership Books—gaining and ]
losing business, &c., &c. Saturdays are devoted to Commercial Law. For \
this purpose, “Parson’s Laws of Business for Business Men” is used as a
text-book, and the students are required to prepare the lessons the same as
recitations in other classes of the College. Particular attention is paid to the
explanation of the Law of Negotiable Paper.
LANGUAGES.
The authorities of the University, well aware of the importance of this
branch of learning, have neglected nothing to obtain able Professors of
German and French.
The German Classes, always numerously attended, owing to the great
number of German-speaking students and the general need of that language
by a large number of our students, will enjoy next year the services of an

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.	55
additional Professor of reputed merit. We intend to place the German
Classes on a footing of excellence reached by no other Institution.
The French language, which is more especially the language of the
Collegiate Courses, will claim a large patronage next year by the ample facili-
ties to learn it which will be placed at the disposal of the students.
A Professor of Hebrew will be in readiness to conduct classes in that
language.
ANATOMY AND MATERIA MEDICA.
Young men desiring to study for the Medical profession will find oppor-
tunities to do so at Notre Dame. Yet, owing to the want of a sufficient
museum whereby this important branch could be thoroughly illustrated, the
course of studies in this Department embraces principally Anatomy. The
remainder of the course is completed in some of our neighboring Universities.
As a Preparatory Course, that which is given here, under Rev. L. Neyron,
M.D., leaves nothing to be desired.
PAINTING- AND DRAWING.
The Drawing Classes showed last year a large increase on the preceding
years. The University enjoys means adequate to all demands in that branch.
It possesses a large quantity of models in all sorts of drawings, a fine studio,
and a vigilant and zealous teacher of the art.
Painting promises likewise to be one of the popular branches of art
taught at Notre Dame.
MUSIC.
This Department is complete in all its appointments. It has five special
Professors of acknowledged ability—Rev. Father Lilly, S.S.C., Bro. Basil,
S.S.O., Bro. Leopold, S.S.C., Prof. J. Regniers and Prof. G. Van de Velde, the
two latter graduates of the Ghent Conservatory of Music. The Department
of Music at Notre Dame is divided off into classes on the regular Conservatory
system.
ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY.
A temporary Astronomical Observatory has been erected, in which the
fine instrument presented by the Emperor Napoleon has been placed. The
studies of the Class of Astronomy are now rendered practically interesting.
LIBRARIES.
The Libraries contain some eleven thousand volumes, very carefully
arranged by the Librarian, Rev. J. C. Carrier. Donations of books, especially
to the Law Library, will be thankfully received.

LITERARY.
“NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC.”
This is the title of a neat little paper published every week, except in
vacation, at the University of Notre Dame. The chief object of this paper is
to keep the parents and friends of our students informed on the various sub-
jects of study and discipline at this University and at St. Mary’s Academy,
and of the progress of their sons and daughters in these two Institutions. For
this purpose regular weekly reports are given, consisting of the names of
those who deserve, by their excellent conduct, to sit at the Tables of Honor,
and who, by their perseverance and industry, deserve special commendation
from their various professors and teachers. Other reports relative to the
arrangement of classes, the promotion of the more talented and energetic
students, etc., also find place in this paper, and keep parents and friends accu-
rately informed on all that concerns their children.
This paper also opens a field for aspiring young writers, who might other-
wise, through timidity, allow their talents in this respect to remain inactive;
while many articles of an instructive and literary character, from writers of
mature mind and ability, render the Scholastic a valuable publication for
all who desire variety and utility in their reading. Our little College paper at
present consists of eight large three-column pages, and as soon as a sufficient
patronage will justify its conductors to do so, it will be increased in size, and
thus rendered still more useful and interesting.

“THE PHILODEMIC OWL”
Motto—“ Nos scribers amor jussit."
Intimately connected with the St. Aloysius’ Philodemic Association is the
publication of “The Philodemic Owl,” a journal devoted to the interests of
the Association. It is conducted by three chief editors, who edit and read it
at the weekly meetings of the Philodemic Association.

Association. It was commenced during the Second Session of 1871-72, and
was skilfully conducted by its three Editors, Messrs. M. Keeley, T. O’Mahony
and N. Mitchell, graduates of ’72. Its object, as the title implies, is a literary
one of the highest order. All the members of the St. Edward’s Literary As-
sociation are its regular contributors.
“THE PHILOMATHEAN STANDARD.”
Motto— The Good, the Beautiful and the True.
This paper is the official organ of the St. Cecilia Philomathean Association.
Like the Owl and the Gem, its prime object is of a literary character, yet it
also embraces music and the current news of the day. It has ten editors,
selected from among the best members of the Society. Each editor presides
over a special department, such as Philosophy, History, the Drama, Music,
Topics of the Day, etc.
Its Editors during the Second Session of 1871-72 were Messrs. M.
Mahoney, J. McHugh (graduates of 1871-72), D. J. Hogan, M. M. Foote,
J. D. Hogan (of’73), C. Hutchings, S. Dum, C. Berdel, C. Dodge, and
W. Dodge, (graduates of ’72 in Commercial Course).
The Philomathean Standard is the largest semi-monthly manuscript
paper at Notre Dame. It last issue was of near seventy pages. It was very
ably edited during the last session, under the special superintendence of Prof.
J. A. Lyons, A.M.

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
t aS my t
NOTRE DAME, INDIANA,
CONDUCTED BY THE SISTERS OF THE HOLY CROSS.
^S^pHIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
W St. Joseph River, is everything that could be desired as a locality for
a Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Educa-
tion are taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumental, and the
Modern Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Although particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of
Catholic pupils, yet pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake
of order, are required to attend the public religious exercises with the mem-
bers of the Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all Modern Improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam; and hot and cold baths are
attached to the sleeping apartments.
The Grounds are very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual powers.	.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
O^For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are
referred to the “ Seventeenth Annual Catalogue of St. Mary’s Academy,” for
the year 1871-72; or address
MOTHER ANGELA, Superior,
St. Mary’s Academy, Notre Dame, Indiana.
