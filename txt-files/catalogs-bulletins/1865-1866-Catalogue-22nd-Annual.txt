-------------
In tlie year 1836, the Rev. S. T. Badin, of venerable memory, while trav-
eling through the northern section of the State of Indiana, visited the spot
now known by the name of “Notre Dawe,” bnt then lying unnoticed in its
native forest wilderness and beauty. Struck by its loveliness, or, to speak
more correctly, influenced by that Providence which directs the most ap-
parently unimportant' events for the accomplishment of its own eternal
designs, Father Badin resolved at once to secure this place to the Church as
the site of a future College. This resolution he executed. Not long after,
it passed into the hands of the Right Rev. Bishop de la Hailandiere, who
transferred it to the Very Rev. E. Sorin, Priest of the Congregation of the
Holy Cross, who, with a few Brothers of the same Order, had come to America
about a year before. In 1843, they first took possession of it, and in a few
years were enabled, by the blessing of Dod, to erect spacious College build-
ings, which have been year after year much enlarged and furnished with all
the modern improvements.
Such has been of late the rapid increase in the number of Students, that
the .Board of Administration has felt obliged to throw aside all previous
calculations, and to prepare at once ample room to accommodate fully and
comfortably five-hundred boarders. It is to meet every want of that number
that the costly building, now fully completed, including all the modern
improvements of the age, and, in a word, every thing that an experience of a
quarter of a century has shown to be beneficial and desirable, has been
planned.
This Institution was incorporated by an Act of the State Legislature of
Indiana, in 1844, under the name and style of “ University of Notre Dame,”
and empowered to confer Degrees in all the learned Professions.
The University of Notre Dame is situated in the lovely valley of the Saint
Joseph, scarcely a mile from that river, and on the banks of two beautiful
lakes of clear spring water. It is in the midst of a fine and healthy jarming
region, and by means of two great trunk lines of Railroad—the Michigan
Central and the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana, the latter passing
within a mile of the College grounds—is easily and,quickly accessible from
every part of the country. At the Michigan Southern Railroad Depot, at

South. Beuel, omnibuses or private conveyances can be obtained. Besides
Stliis, a stage passes the College twice a day, connecting the two lines of Rail-
road. In the city itself there are large and commodious hotels, where every
comfort may be enjoyed.
The University is conducted by the Fathers of the Congregation of the
Holy Cross; a number of highly competent Lay Professors assist in the various
branches of Studies; other Teachers and the Prefects of Discipline are sup-
plied by the Brothers of the Holy Cross, who are, like the Fathers, devoted
by their sacred calling to the education and instruction of youth.
The disciplinary government is mild, yet sufficiently energetic to preserve
the most perfect order and regularity. The morals and the general deport-
ment'of Pupils are assiduously watched over, and their comforts and per-
sonal habits receive the same attention as if they were in the bosom of their
own families.
The Tables of Honor, Weekly Notes, Monthly Certificates, Quarterly Bul-
letins, Semi-Annual Examinations and Annual Distribution of Premiums are
among the many means made use of to excite emulation and love of study in
the minds of Pupils and reward the diligent.
Experience constantly proves that a young man may be kept within the
line of duty more by a sense of honor and justice, than	fear of punishmenp.
Catholic parents may rest assured that the most zealous care will be taken
that their children comply regularly with their religious duties, and that no
efforts will be spared in instructing them fully in the principles and obliga-
tions of their Holy Religion.
Although all the members of the Faculty and other College officers profess
the Catholic Religion, Students belonging to any other denomination are
received ; nothing is required of them, in this respect, but to assist, for uni-
formity’s sake, at all the public and regular exercises of Religion with pro-
priety and decorum.
The Pupils are divided, according to their age, into the Minim, Junior
and Senior Departments, each having its separate dormitory, study-hall,
class-rooms, play-grounds, etc., its own complete Gymnasium, with its. own
Prefects and Teachers.
The Institution possesses a valuable Library of about seven thousand
volumes, besides three other small Libraries for the use of the. different Col-
lege Societies, a complete set of Philosophical and Chemical Apparatus, a
Museum of Natural History, and a rich Collection of Plants. Among the
peculiar advantages which this Institution presents, as a place of Education,
may be noticed—
1	.—Its Retired Location. At a time and in a country where serious and
solid studies are rare; where dissipations of every kind are thrown in the
way of the young Student; where visitors often interrupt the course of the
scholar; and wdiere morals are but slightly watched over, it seems that every
UNIVERSITY OE NOTRE DAME.	7
parent who desires to secure to his son an opportunity of spending the few
years of his education usefully and profitably, and passing safely the danger-'
ous season of early youth removed from all the temptations of our large
cities, should readily comprehend the advantage of placing him in such an
Institution as Notre Dawe. Here, the young student is under the most
watchful and parental care; here he can apply himself, undisturbed, to his
studies, under competent Professors, and may acquire a solid knowledge of
every thing to which he may wish to devote his attention; here also, his
young mind breathes an atmosphere of piety? the influences of which will
hover around him throughout his life.
2	.—Its Extensive G-eoends. If Students are here deprived of hurtful
pleasures and dissipations which abound in large cities, they are amply remu-
nerated by those delightful and innocent amusements which the nature of
this locality so abundantly provides. Nearly one thousand acres of land are
attached to the College, and are well laid out, both by nature and art, for
College purposes. Whilst the moral and intellectual culture of the Students
is attended to with all possible care and solicitude, their physical develop-
ment is by no means neglected. Two ball-alleys, two ten-pin alleys, three
gymnastic apparatuses, lately built with much ingenuity and skill, together
with a variety of the latest and most interesting games, viz: foot-ball, cricket,
etc., lend alike by their judicious use to invigorate the body and recreate the
mind. Moreover the extensive forests surrounding the College* give the best
opportunities to those who are fond of hunting, whilst the two beautiful
Lakes, upon whose banks the University stands, afford choice fishing-grounds
and baths in summer, and almost uninterrupted skating during winter. No
one for a moment can doubt that these manly sports are highly conducive to
the health and happiness of Pupils. All Educators know that innocent,
exhilarating and somewhat exciting amusements are the best safeguard of
morals for children, especially for young men.
3	.—The Caub taken in Sickness. Students, when ill, have not to remain
in the College Rooms, but are immediately transferred to the apartments of
the Infirmary, where they are attended and nursed, with devoted care, by ex-
perienced Sisters, who never suffer them to be alone, but strive to supply the
place of their absent mothers. An eminent and experienced Physician—a
graduate of the “Ecole de Medecine” of Lyons, Erance—resides permanently
in the College.
The last Scholastic year has been marked with a success unprecedented in
the annals of the Institution; the number of Pupils, both here and at St.
Mary’s Academy, exceeded by over one-third that of any former year.
The different Departments have likewise been more fully developed, both
in reference to classes and discipline. The Eaculty is also more efficient and
more numerous than before.

lastic sessions in September and February, but Pupils are admitted at all times
during the year, and their session commences with the date of their entrance.
When Parents wish to have their children sent home, they must give timely
notice, settle all accounts, and supply means to defray all traveling expenses.
Should a Student withdraw- himself, or be withdrawn by his parents or
guardians before the expiration of the session, no deduction is made, except
in cases of sickness or dismissal.

The Academic year commences on the first Tuesday of September, and
11 closes on 'the last Wednesday of dune, When the Annual Commencement, the
j Conferring of Degrees and the Distribution of Premiums take place. It is
! divided into two Sessions of five months each. At the termination of each
; Session, a strict examination of all the different classes is made in the pres-
! encc of the Faculty.	.
:	When a Student presents himself for admission into the College, he is ex-
’ amined by the Director of Studies, and placed in that class for which hispre-
। vious attainments may have qualified him. His further promotion depends
J on his application and progress. Should any Student, during the year, be
J found capable of passing to a higher class, he will be promoted, and such
j promotion is equivalent to the honors of the class he left.
! The Degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred on such of the Students
as shall have completed their Classical Course, and passed successfully a strict
examination before the Faculty.
The Degree of Master of Arts will be conferred on each of the graduates
of the first Degree, who shall have devoted at least two years to Literary or
Scientific Studies.
The Degrees of Bachelor of Science and of Master of Science will also be
conferred on similar conditions.
Diplomas will be given to those Students who shall have completed the
Commercial Course, passed a satisfactory examination before the Board of
Examiners, and given clear evidence of their moral character.
Students who do not desire to graduate, may adopt a partial or irregular
course, fitting them for Commercial life, for Civil Engineering, &c., or for
any pursuit outside of the Learned Professions, which requires a special
training. Such a course would run parallel with the regular course, and
would include all the advantages, literary and otherwise, which the Institu-
tion offers to its inmates in common.
Special facilities exist at Notre Dame for the acquirement of the French
and German Languages. Not only are these Languages taught very carefully
by persons of acknowledged competency, but many of the members of the
Institution being natives of France and Germany opportunities at all times
occur for conversation in these tongues.
All Students applying for admission will be required to give satisfactory
evidence of their moral standing.
All letters sent and received by Students may be opened and read by the
President or his substitute.	.
10	UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE* DAME

13th. Whether in class or recreation, when permitted to converse at table

would be profitably employed, if nothing else were learned than to converse
and behave with the dignity and propriety of gentlemen.
•14th. No one shall keep in his possession any money, except what he
receives weekly from the Treasurer, on Wednesday, at 10 o’clock, a. m.
15th. On the first Wednesday of every month, “ Certificates of Good Con-
duct” and of “ Improvement in Class” are issued by the Faculty to such Stu-

the Students whose conduct has been most exemplary during the preceding
week. They are elected by the unanimous vote of the Professors and Prefects.
16 th. In winter, on Saturday, at 4 o’clock, p. m., the Students must wash

Joseph’s Lake.
17th. On Sunday and Wednesday mornings, the Students must place
upon their beds, wrapped up, their soiled linen of the previous half week.
On Monday morning, the Students of the Senior and Junior Departments
repair, in ranks and in silence, to their Dormitories, whence they take
their Sunday clothes and carry them to their trunks. And on Saturday, at
half-past three o’clock, they go in the same manner to the Trunk Room, and
bring their Sunday clothes to their Dormitories. The Students will be
reviewed at eight o’clock on Sunday and Wednesday mornings, with special
reference to their personal neatness.
18th. Stationery, etc., will be delivered to Students as follows: On Mon-
days and Thursdays, at half-past twelve o’clock, to the Students of the Senior

expressly for this purpose can be obtained from the Secretary.
19th. Students who may have failed to give satisfaction in the Class Room,
or who shall have been guilty of misconduct, or breach of rule, will be sent

20th. Those Students who read sufficiently well and audibly, will occupy
the Reader’s Stand, in their turn, in the Refectory. An alphabetical 'list of
Public Readers will be posted in a conspicuous place, and every one named

of Health to go to the Infirmary, and will observe the regulations of that
place until his recovery.

College, without being previously examined and approved by the Prefect of
12
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,
f
Studies. Objectionable books found in the possession of Students, will be
withheld from them until their departure from the University.
N. B. The happiness, no less than the improvement of Students, is so
closely connected with the good order and even rigid discipline of the
College, that no young gentleman of good sense, who has at heart his own
welfare and the accomplishment of his purpose in entering the Institution,
can fail to discover the importance of a strict observance of the foregoing
Rules. If the authorities of the University exhort all to exhibit a sincere
and unwavering zeal in keeping these Regulations, they demand of Students
nothing more than the promotion of their own interest.
*** There are in the Institution several Societies, whose Constitutions
and By-Laws have been approved by the Faculty, such as the Saint Vincent
de Paul’s, Arch-Confraternity, Saint Aloysius’ Literary and Historical, Holy
Angels’, Saint Cecilia, and Philharmonic Societies, with which Students are
authorized and recommended to unite themselves.

--------------------------------
gfHIS Institution, situated on the beautiful and picturesque banks of the
St. Joseph River, is every thing that could be desired as a locality for a
Female Academy. All the branches of a solid and complete Education are ■
taught here. Music especially, both Vocal and Instrumentel, and the Mod-
ern Languages, form prominent features in the Course of Instruction.
Particular attention is paid to the Religious Instruction of Catholic pupils.
Pupils of all denominations are received, and, for the sake of order, merely
required to attend the public religious exercises with the members of the
Institution.
The Buildings are spacious and commodious, suited to the Educational
requirements of the day, and furnished with all 'Modern Improvements.
Every portion of the building is heated by steam, and hot and cold baths
are attached to the sleeping apartments.	•
The Grounds arc very extensive, beautifully adorned, and situated in that
charming seclusion which is so favorable to the healthful development of
moral, physical and intellectual power.
The proximity of the two Institutions to each other is a great convenience
to parents having children at both, when they visit their sons and daughters.
For further particulars concerning this Institution, the public are

MAY 31, 1866.
------
[Abridged from Editorial Correspondence of the Philadelphia Stakdahd.]
The festival of Corpus Christi fell this year on May 31st This last day
of the month now universally consecrated by Catholic piety to the honor
of the Blessed Virgin, has been selected by our Holy Father, the Pope, for
the festival of the Association of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, a new work
of piety lately established in Prance and Belgium. This day thus by coin-
cidence honored by a double festivity was chosen by the Superiors of the
Congregation of the Holy Cross for the inauguration of a colossal statue of
the Blessed Virgin, the blessing of the newly erected College, and the dedi-
cation to Our Lady of all the lands, buildings and persons of this vast and
beautiful domain.
The solemn occasion drew together a large number of Bishops and Priests,
and a vast concourse of the laity. The Prelates present were the Most Bev.
M. J. Spalding, D. D.. Archbishop of Baltimore; Right Rev. J. H. Luers,
D. D., Bishop of Fort Wayne, in whose diocese the institutions of Notre .
Danie are situated; Right Rev. J. M. Henni, D. D., Bishop of Milwaukee;
Right Rev. John Timon, D. D., Bishop of Buffalo ; Right Rev. A. Rappe,
D. D., Bishop of Cleveland, and Right Rev. T. L. Grace, D. D., Bishop of
St. Paul. The number of Clergymen of the second order in attendance, was
very great. The concourse of the laity was simply immense. It is estimated
that there were at least five thousand persons present. Of course the greater
number were from South Bend and the sufrounding country, but there were
visitors from Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The ceremonies of the day commenced at nine o’clock, with the Solemn
High Mass, sung in the church of the college, by the Right Rev. Bishop
Henni, of Milwaukee. The Assistant Priest was Very Rev. M. Heiss, of Mil-
waukee; Deacons of Honor, Very Rev. W. Gleeson, V. G., Buffalo, and your
correspondent; Deacon of the Mass, Rev. Charles Mangin, Crawfordsville,
Indiana ; Sub-deacon, Rev. S. C. Doherty, S. S. C., Notre Dame, Indiana.
The vocal and instrumental music was very good indeed, and reflected
great credit on this department of the University. The ceremonies were
carried out correctly, with order and decorum.
Immediately after Mass, a procession was formed to the garden in front of
the college. Remarkably good order was preserved, a well pre-arranged
system indicated in a printed programme being accurately carried out, so
that in a few moments the vast assemblage moved from the church to their
allotted places, without any disturbance or confusion. On the porch of the
college were seated the Bishops and Clergy; to the left were the college
students, the apprentices, and the Brothers; to the right the pupils and ;
Sisters of St. Mary’s Academy; and in the center the strangers who had «
flocked to witness the ceremonies.	'
The sermon of the Archbishop of Baltimore occupied about an hour, and
was listened to with respectful and breathless attention by the vast audience, 1
to the extreme lines of which the clear, distinct* enunciation of the speaker i
reached with ease. Every one was well pleased with the discourse, which j
was remarkably well adapted to the occasion. The imposing appearance of )•
the venerable speaker, first by reason of the honor granted to his See, in the d
American Hierarchy, the solemn array of Bishops and Clergy that surrounded
[ him, the crowds that hung on his words, formed a tableau not likely to be
j soon effaced from the memory, and impressed the more deeply on the hearers’
minds, the truths which were promulgated in animated, living tones.
After the sermon, the procession of ecclesiastics was formed again and pro-
.	----------- , x .	----- o--------X
I ceeded through the whole building, the usual ceremony of the blessing' of a
I	t	i •	r» ___	i_n' J ____ ri _	_	. _t» ri j -n n 7	.7
new house being performed by Bishop Grace, of St. Paul, who was vested
in cope and mitre.
When the procession had at length arrived at the dome,
the Most Rev. Archbishop assumed the sac ed vestments, and proceeded to
the blessing of the colossal statue. This is twelve feet high, (its entire
hight from the ground being 132 feet), and, viewed from far or near, must
be pronounced a fine work of art. It was carved after the designs, and
under the superintendence of Air. Buscher, of Chicago. The ceremony vras
performed according to the rite of the Roman Pontifical, the Psalms being
chanted by the choir of Priests around the dome, and the Magnificat [by the
orchestra and students of the College], below.
xVfter the blessing of the statue came the presentation by the Archbishop
of their diplomas to the '• Guard of Honor.” This “ Guard” is composed of
thirty iadies and gentlemen, who are the donors of the statue, of the oratory
in the dome, and of the crown which is to be kept there. The crown,
which was made in Paris, cost $1,500, and has been blessed by the Pope.
The names of the members of the “ Guard of Honor” are engraved on it,
marked on portions corresponding with the mysteries of the Rosary.
Next followed the solemn act of consecration to the Blessed Virgin. This
was made by a little boy not seven years old, whose affecting tale, told by
himself, drew tears from the Archbishop, and few dry eyes witnessed the
scene. This little waif, snatched from the stormy waves of civil war, by the
love which has its origin and life from the Heart of Jesus, solemnly offered
and consecrated to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart all the possessions of the
Congregation of the Holy Cross, the members themselves, the pupils under
their care, and the members of the Guard of Honor.
Immediately after this ceremony the procession returned to the College
porch. There the Archbishop announced the names of the successful com-
petitors for the prizes for essays in honor of the Blessed Virgin : for the best
in poetry, George H. Miles, Esq., of Emmittsburg, Md., and Mrs. Anna H.
Dorsey, of Washington. D. C.; in prose, Orestes A. Brownson, LL. D., of
Elizabeth, N. J., and Louis Constantin.
There were five secondary premiums in prose, and also five in poetry.
The names of all the writers—in number over one hundred—will be in-
cased in a silver heart, and sent immediately to the House of Loretto, in Italy.
At 4 oclock Vespers, followed by a sermon on the Blessed Sacrament, by
Right Rev. Bishop Timon, after which the procession was commenced.
The Blessed Sacrament was carried by the Right Rev. Bishop Rappe, of
Cleveland. The procession wended its way around the lake behind the
college buildings, stopping at two altars, where the Benediction was given.
It was a very imposing sight, carrying the mind back to bygone days in
Catholic lands. As the sound of the singing of hymns was wafted on the
calm evening air, and the chimes of Notre Dame called all to pay due honor
to the King of kings borne in triumph through His own domain, there was
an universal feeling of joy and thankfulness that our faith was being
rooted so firmly and deeply in this favored land.
This celebration certainly was a great event, speaking eloquently of the
progress of our Holy Faith in the West. Our Blessed Lady gave beautiful
weather to grace her festival, and, through her blessing, every thing con-
tributed to the success of the solemnity. This will be long remembered by
every one that witnessed it, and to the Fathers and Brothers of the Congre-
gation of the Holy Cross is justly a source of mutual congratulation and joy,
in which all their friends join most heartily.
