Far from the well-known and closely-guarded laboratories
where atom bombs are built, a group of scientists at Notre
Dame quietly explores the peaceful applications of powerful
radiation to a variety of biological and industrial projects
jointly sponsored by the university .and the Atomic Energy
Commission. In chemistry a group of well-known professors
which includes old-hand nuclear chemists like Hamill and
Williams, the theorist Magee, organicers Price and E'liel, in-
organicers McCusker and Quagliano and structure specialist
Bro. Columba, C.S.C., have drawn together in a project
headed by Burton to work on problems related to atomic
energy.
In one of the world’s best-equipped radiation chemistry
laboratories, the Notre Dame researchers have available a
1,000,000 electron volt radio-active cobalt source and a
2,000,000 electron volt Van de Graaff accelerator. At the
present time the scientists are studying with special interest

the reaction of water and other solu-
tions exposed to radiation. In addi-
tion, the Radiation Project Labs at-
tract scientists from all parts of the
world to take advantage of the out-
standing facilities for research.
With the move of the undergradu-
ate chemistry and physics departments
to the new Nieuwland Science Hall
a year ago, the Radiation Project ex-
panded into adequate space for the
first time in its six-year history. Now
located in the basement of the old
building, the project personnel pursue
basic research that can have far-
reaching effects on health, safety and
nutrition in the future.
Dr. Milton Burton, professor of
chemistry at Notre Dame, has di-
rected the project since 1946. Cur-
rently, nine senior staff members, four
post-doctorate research associates and
15 pre-doctorate graduate students
are engaged in chemical studies re-
lated to atomic energy. Dr. Andrew
J. Boyle is administrative director of
the project.
Key equipment in the laboratories
is dominated by the Van de Graaff
accelerator operating in a specially
designed room behind brick and con-
crete walls up to 54 inches thick.

The author will graduate from Notre
Dame in June, 1954, with a Bachelor
of Arts degree, having majored in
Journalism. He served with the 3rd
Armored Division and was assigned
to the unit’s Public Information office
at Fort Knox, Ky. Mr. Kelleher for-
merly worked for Chrysler Corpora-
tion’s publicity division, the Depart-
ment of Public Information at Notre
Dame, and presently is on part-time
duty with Mort Linder and Associates,
a South Bend public relations firm.

Because of the danger of exposure
of personnel to radiation, the elec-
tron stream emitted from the ma-
chine under vacuum must be con-
trolled from an adjoining room. A
series of four switches, two of them
in the generator, must be activated
to start the machine, thus protecting
anyone inadvertently left in the gen-
erator room when experiments are
scheduled to begin.
The generator resembles a huge
pressure tank, of the type usually used
to store gases. A charge of electrical
energy is (built up within the tank,
whirling through a system of belts
until the pressure, or voltage, reaches
a pre-determined level and is shot
through the long tube at one end of
the generator. The radiation charge is
“aimed” or focused very precisely at
a steel framework just at the end of
the generator tube, where experimen-
tal materials are bolted in place.
From the adjoining control room,
the scientists can observe the behavior
of their experiments in operation. The
method devised by the researchers to
watch the generator without danger is
one of the most fascinating phases of
the project to the layman. The feat
is accomplished by an ingenious ar-
rangement of mirrors and an angled
tube of water.
The six-foot-long water-filled tube
is capped at either end with clear
glass and penetrates the thick insulat-
Vol. 6 * No. 4	3
ing wall between the generator and
control rooms to the left of the atom
smasher. The liquid effectively pro-
tects against scattered radiation while
permitting safe vision into the charged
atmosphere of the generator room.
One mirror is positioned directly in
front of the generator at an angle to
reflect its image into a second mirror
in front of the water tube. This sec-
ond mirror can be precisely adjusted
by electrically actuated motors from
the control room to make the bom-
bardment process in the generator
room clearly visible to the experi-
menters.
Radiation Creates Constant Danger
As soon as the generator is
switched off, of course, the room is
safe for the scientists. In the case of
the cobalt, however, the radiation
Dr. Burton places a solution in the cobalt
container. The radioactive material is
lowered over the solution after heavy lead
turret containing cobalt is moved into place.
creates an ever present danger that
must always be respected.
Insulated with six tons of protec-
tive lead, the self-contained, compact
cobalt source container provides the
research men with a second and dif-
ferent type of radiation for experi-
mentation. Its half-pint sized vial of
cobalt-source container provides the
period of exposure in the atomic pile
at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Constantly emitting radiation within
its container, the cobalt is moved on
a wheeled dolly over either of two
deep wells and the lethal vial lowered
by remote control to irradiate ma-
terials in the wells. The cobalt source
container permits samples to be pre-
pared safely in one well while the vial
is lowered into the other, allowing
uninterrupted use of the equipment.
This relatively simple and versatile
piece of equipment was built on the
campus by the Notre Dame scientists
in cooperation with the Oak Ridge
Laboratories. The heavy lead turret,
many times larger than the small
brass vial it encases, was shipped to
Oak Ridge as soon as its precise ma-
chining was completed in the cam-
pus shops and there was “loaded”
with the cobalt isotope.
Always aware of the invisible dan-
gers of radiation, the researchers pe-
riodically check the area in and
around the old Chemistry Building at
Notre Dame to detect the most mi-
nute radiation leaks from their equip-
ment. For personal protection the
scientists wear “pencil cells,” which
are checked daily and “tracer badges”
that get a weekly check, and give
ample warning of a dangerous ex-
posure level.
N.D. Scientists Collaborate With A.E.C.
Experiments with the cobalt source
are also closely watched by the re-
searchers, but in this case the reac-
tions deep within the lead container
must be registered on a number of
complex instruments in the labora-
tory. The newly-revamped facilities
include space for another cobalt
source .container of entirely different
design, now being planned by the
Notre Dame scientists and the Atomic
Energy Commission workers at Oak
Ridge. Once the second source is
completed, the Notre Dame project
will be even more useful for a wide
variety of contemplated research.
Little of the work being done in
the Notre Dame Radiation Project is
likely to result in startling and dra-
matic discoveries of the type that will
catch the public’s imagination. But in
developing scientific talent in this
most advanced field of modern chem-
istry, the Notre Dame project will
have important repercussions in
adapting the knowledge of atomic ra-
diation to a better, healthier life.
The Atomic Energy Commission donated
$166,000 for Notre Dame’s . Radiation
Project during the current fiscal year.

4 Notre Dame

The quick, colorful days of autumn
folded into pages of memory. Now
are the days of the crisp, hard wind;
these are the hours when it is good
to lean against a radiator and to gaze
over the snow covered campus.
Even in winter our campus buzzes
with activity. It is good to see our
young lads rush from halls to class-
rooms; it is good to know that the
winters of years to come will have
leaders who can give a ray of warmth
and light to a dark world.
We are a crowded campus. For the
first time in our history we have gone
beyond the dreams of the men who
founded Notre Dame. It used to be
said that Notre Dame should always
be a small school, that we should stay
at a student body of 3500. But who
can say that Notre Dame should be
forever small? We now have 5400
young men at our school. Were we to
put an ironclad top on enrollment
many young men would be deprived
of what we offer at Notre Dame. We
know, of course, that a large student
body makes great demands on every
phase of University life. Professors
had to be hired, classroom space made
available. We have reached to the
future with a hope that the things
that made Notre Dame great will
never be lost. Rather, we look to a
greater Notre Dame.
One aspect of the greater Notre
Dame is the physical plant expansion.
! With joy and gratitude, I can tell of
buildings that have put a new look on
the campus.
I told of the I. A. O’Shaughnessy
Hall of Liberal and Fine Arts. This
structure is a gem. Only by seeing it
can you realize its beauty and its
value to our academic life.
Since the Fall term began we dedi-
cated the magnificent Nieuwland Hall
of Science. This is another gigantic
structure. Here we have laboratories,
classrooms and lecture halls. Here we
have a monument dedicated to the
generosity of our many friends who
know that the University of Notre
Dame has always been eager in the
development of scientific knowledge.
Thanks to the generosity of Mr.
and Mrs. Joseph LaFortune for a
substantial gift and to our Woman’s
Advisory Council, the old Science
Building is now the Student Center.
It is hard to imagine that old mu-
seum as a center for student activity.
But it is. And a really beautiful center.
On the day of our first home foot-
ball game we dedicated the Lewis bus
shelter. This is not a big building but
it was a needed one. Students now
have a place to protect them from
inclement weather as they await the
buses to town. We are grateful to
Mr. and Mrs. Lewis of Chicago for
their kindness.
You are aware of the achievements
of the Fighting Irish this past season.
We are proud of them. To the team
and the coaches, to the band and the
director we write this word of public
praise. The long hours of hard work
was evident each week of the long
season.
Each home football game brought
to the campus some of our dearest
friends. People came from all parts
of America to cheer our team to vic-
tory. Among our visiting friends were
the members of our Councils, the
Alumni Board and the Board of Lay
Trustees. They gave of their valuable
time so that we might profit from
their prudent advice and sound judg-
ment. We are most fortunate to have
these devoted friends and we pray
that Our Lady grant them much
happiness for their kindness.
It has been said with truth that
Christmas is the feast of home. It is
a time when the family is drawn
closer together because of a Child
born into the world. Each one of you
is part of the Notre Dame family.
Across the chilled hardness of our
campus the church bells ring a soft,
familiar tone. The buildings draw
closer. High in the frozen stillness of
the night Our Lady stands and looks
over her campus. I look to her who
is the mother of the Child. My
prayers, and the prayers of all of us
at Notre Dame is that each of us will
be closer together in the Oneness of
Christ, not only during this lovely
season of Christmas but through the
coming year.

ORESTES A. BROWNSON
‘Yankee Warrior” Was Distinguished American Philospher and Essayist
There is a tombstone in the center
aisle of the chapel beneath Sacred
Heart Church at Notre Dame. The
inscription on it reads: “Here lies
Orestes A. Brownson. He humbly
recognized the true faith, lived a
wholesome life, vigorously defended
the Church and his country both with
tongue and pen. Although his body
has succumbed, the works of his mind
remain, immortal monuments of his
genius.”
That, in a capsule, sums up the
story of the man whom many claim
was probably the most important con-
vert the Catholic Church has had in
America.
He was to America what Cardinal
Newman was to England, and the ca-
reers of the two men were parallel
in time as well as in accomplishment.
But today the works of Newman arc
still read while, ironic as it may seem,
the “Old Yankee Warrior” is a for-
gotten man, 77 years after the end
of his stormy career.
Why is this, you ask? What was
Brownson like? That is rather hard
to answer in one sentence, or even
one page. In fact, it borders on the
unanswerable.
A Man in Search of Something
You see, Brownson was for a time a
Protestant minister, yet eventually be-
came the recognized champion of the
Catholic Church; he was for a time
a member of the communist party,
yet he loved the American democratic
form of government.
Perhaps Brownson could best be de-
picted as a man in search of some-
thing. Tall and distinguished, yet
physically and mentally a powerful
man, Brownson tried innumerable
Protestant sects before finally entering
the Catholic Church on October 20,
1844. But even then he seemed to be
restless, searching . . . searching for
new ways to spread Catholic doctrine
and bring converts into the Church.
He was, however, as tactless as he
was fearless and his forceful personal-
ity not only failed to influence many
would-be converts but even brought
him almost as many quarrels within
the Church as without.
Perhaps a look at his background
will provide us with some insight into
the driving force behind his restless,
overbearing manner and sincere, de-
termined nature.
Born in Vermont
Brownson was born in the village
of Stockbridge, Vermont in 1803 and
knew nothing but hardships from the
very start. When Orestes was two his
father died and the family of five
children had to be split up. He was
taken in by elderly neighbors and led
an extremely lonely life with them.
Consequently, reading became his fa-
vorite pastime.
But he did not tend toward chil-
dren’s books; instead he was inter-
ested chiefly in books on deep reli-
gious subjects and began to acquire a
vast store of knowledge. He was
therefore disliked by boys and girls
his own age, but older people held a
great measure of respect for him.
Eventually Brownson’s mother was
able to call the family together for a
few years in an upper New York town
and during this period Brownson at-
tended school for a few months—the
only formal education he was to re-
ceive.
Taught School in Detroit
At eighteen he joined the Presbyte-
rian church but its doctrine of pre-
destination clashed with his own per-
sonal views and he soon drifted away.
He then taught school for awhile in
Detroit and after a serious illness, he
became a Universalist minister.
In 1827, when he was 24. the
young minister married one of his
parishioners — slim, dark-eyed Sarah
Healy. Through success and failure
for almost 40 years Sarah Healy
Brownson was perhaps the only per-
son who came close to understanding
the genius.
by Kenneth F. Murphy
The author is a Senior in the De-
partment of Journalism and writes a
weekly column for the Notre Dame
Scholastic, student news magazine.
Mr. Murphy is fiom Utica, N. Y.
The story zeas paiaphtased from an
article in the St. Joseph magazine,
September, 1953.
Brownson’s searching mind soon
found difficulty in Universalism also,
and it was here he ebbed to the low-
est point of his career. It was here
also that he deviated from the reli-
gious to the political when he took
up by chance with Fanny Wright and
Robert Owen, communistic schemers
from the British Isles who insisted
that they were fighting for the cause
of the working man. Brownson was
naturally drawn to this for the sud-
den growth of industrialism during
the early 1800’s had alarmed him and
the life of a “wage-slave” in the
Massachusetts mills was. to him. un-
bearable.
So, for two years he publicized this
“crusade” before coming to the real-
ization that the communist pair was
interested solely in the profits they
could reap from their political ad-
ventures. (It is interesting to note
here that Brownson, as early as 1830,
predicted that the only possible prov-
ing-ground for communism would be
in Russia. 1
Through this experience he came
to the realization that no social re-
form is possible without strong re-
ligious convictions behind it.
Brownson then became attracted to
Unitarianism for a time, but later
made the move which was to change
his entire life and the life of many
Catholics in the United States. He
decided to set up his own religion
and, with a group of other ministers,
organized the independent Church of

7
the Future. This religion was to be
based on the best doctrines and prac-
tices from all the other sects and it
was in his study of the various reli-
gions that Brownson was first ex-
posed to Catholicism.
It was about this time—in the dec-
ade between 1834 and 1844 — that
Brownson came into contact with and
influenced some of the literary giants
of the time., including Emerson., Whit-
tier, Hawthorne, Thoreau and Alcott.
His influence also fell upon one Isaac
Hecker, a young man who eventually
became a Catholic and the founder
of the Paulist Fathers.
Brownson himself had started to be-
come active in the literary field, writ-
ing for various religious and political
organs until, in 1838, he finally be-
came editor of the Boston Quarterly
Review. (After his conversion to
Catholicism in 1844 Brownson changed
the name to Brownson’s Quarterly
Review.)
Simultaneously, Brownson was in
great demand as a lecturer, travelling
around the entire Eastern part of the
country.
Studied Thomas Aquinas
In politics as a humanitarian he
naturally leaned toward the Demo-
cratic party of Jackson and Van
Buren; here, he thought, was the
party of the people. But when Van
Buren was defeated by Harrison in
1840, Brownson was disillusioned; he
felt the people had betrayed him and
was soon attracted to the states
rights, “aristocratic democracy” of
Calhoun.
But after his conversion to Cathol-
icism Brownson spent less and less
time considering political theory. He
so firmly believed in his new-found
Church that he tried to learn all he
could about it, preparing himself to
defend it. He studied Thomas Aqui-
nas and even mastered Latin. It
wasn’t long before Brownson was cele-
brated as America’s number one Cath-
olic philosopher.
At first the Catholics welcomed
such a dominant and powerful figure
into their ranks, but because most
Catholics in the United States were
poorly educated at the time, they
failed to comprehend the deep philo-
sophical import of Brownson’s ravings
and eventually they too turned
against him.
Brownson moved from Boston to
Symposium participants: (L to R) Prof. Caponigri, Father McAvoy and Prof. Fitzsimons.
A Symposium: Brownson
A symposium commemorating the 150th anniversary of the birth of
Orestes A. Brownson, distinguished nineteenth century American philosopher
and essayist, was held at the University of Notre Dame on October 7th. The
Rev. Thomas T. McAvoy, C.S.C., University archivist, was chairman of the
symposium.
During the symposium, Notre Dame’s departments of philosophy, political
science, history and English joined in a study of the various phases of Brown-
son’s activities. Professor A. R. Caponigri discussed Brownson’s conversion in
a paper entitled “Brownson’s Spiritual Journey.” Other speakers and their
subjects included Professor M. A. Fitzsimons, “Brownson’s Association with
the Early Social Reforms”; Rev. Chester A. Soleta, C.S.C., “Brownson as a
Literary Critic”; and Rev. Stanley J. Parry, C.S.C., “Brownson’s Political
Theory.”
New York in 1857 because of friction
and thence to New Jersey after
trouble with Archbishop Hughes,
where he remained until 1875, a year
before his death.
Brownson lost two sons in the Civil
War and he was never quite the same
man after 1864. The following year
he discontinued his Review, although
he did consent to write a series of
articles for Father Sorin’s brand-new
Ave Maria magazine at Notre Dame.
The articles explained the philos-
ophy behind devotion to the Blessed
Mother and the Saints, and in 1866
he started a second series, this time
approaching the moral and social
sides of devotion to Mary.
His articles were praised by many
prominent American critics, Catholic
and Protestant alike. But now, though
the Ave Maria he helped to fame is
still a familiar part of Notre Dame,
Brownson is unread and unknown.
Brownson’s wife died in 1872 and
partially in her honor he revived his
Review in what he called The Last
Series. The last issue reached the
public late in 1875, a few months
before his own death.
Brownson was getting old and he
said he wanted to spend his last days
on Our Lady’s campus, so Father
Sorin offered him a home at Notre
Dame. But Brownson decided to go
first to Detroit to spend some time
with his son and it was there he died,
the day after Easter Sunday.
Ten years later, June 17, 1886, his
body was transferred to Notre Dame.
He was re-buried with ceremony in
the floor of the then-new basement
chapel; and it was named the Brown-
son Memorial Chapel in his honor.
But you never hear it called by
that name anymore. The grave is
still there, of course, covered by a
stone slab. And once in a while
somebody will glance at the Latin in-
scription on the slab, and nobody

NOTRE DAME SEEKS
HIGHPAYJEACHERS
Wants Corporations to Add
$10,000 to Salaries of 45
of Outstanding Caliber
Special to The New York Times.
SOUTH BEND, Ind., Oct. 24—
A plan to bring forty-five out-
standing educators to the faculty
of the University of Notre Dame
by offering salaries sufficient to
attract them was outlined today
by the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh,
C. S. C., director of the Notre
Dame Foundation.
Father Cavanaugh said that
business corporations throughout
the country would be asked to
underwrite the project. For the
faculty members to be added it
would augment by about $10,000
the salary of a professor at the
university. The average salary, a
university spokesman said, was
$6,000 to $7,500.
The plan, called the Distin-
guised Professors Program, was
announced at meetings of the

ing educators to the Faculty of

alumni board of directors and the
Advisory Council for the College
of Commerce. The council is com-
posed of thirty-four business
executives.
A spokesman for the university
said that under the plan new
members for the faculty would be
sought in this country and abroad.
Symbols of Enterprise
Father Cavanaugh, who was
president of Notre Dame from 1946
to 1952, declared that corporations
would be approached as the sym-
bols of private enterprise.
“Because we believe that, for the
good of the country,” he said,
“strong tax-supported institutions
of higher learning should co-exist
with equally strong private col-
leges and universities, we are ap-
proaching corporation executives,
confident that they will welcome
the partnership which we propose
for the education of morally re-
sponsible leaders for the nation.”
He asserted that announcement
of the plan, which differs marked-
ly from other programs for busi-
ness-education cooperation in that
money would go directly to aug-
ment salaries, implied no depreca-
tion of the “splendid corps of pro-
fessors” on the 560-man faculty.
He said that the combination
of increased enrollment — 5,400
now compared with 3,500 in pre-
war years — and the departure of
some members of the faculty each
year for better paying posts in
industry and research made the
move necessary.
“It is our hope to replace these
men with the best teaching fac-
ulty we can secure and to encour-
age the academic advancement of
our continuing faculty members
as well,” he added.
A pre-test of the plan in several
cities had indicated “enthusiastic
and encouraging” responses from
corporation executives, according
to the priest.
In praising the efforts of busi-
ness men and educators to find
a solution to increasing educa-
tional costs he asserted that Notre
Dame agreed with the Committee
on Financing Higher Education
that to pass along all of the in-
creasing costs to students would
be unwise.
He stated that because one of
every five faculty members was
a priest who received no salary
and because of gifts, research
funds and “auxiliary enterprises,
including athletics,” tuition rates
at Notre Dame were about 30 per
cent below the actual per student
cost of operating the university.
“In order to continue and ex-
tend the opportunity of a Notre
Dame education to as many young
men as possible,” he added, “the
Notre Dame Foundation will con-
centrate in the coming months on
the raising of funds for the full
development of our present and
future faculty.
“We inaugurate the Distin-
guished Professors Program con-
vinced of its necessity and con-
fident of its success.”

... the Nieuwland Science Hall
The Most Rev. John F. O’Hara,
C.S.C., Archbishop of Philadelphia
and president of Notre Dame when
the late Father Julius A. Nieuwland
was a member of the faculty, offici-
ated at the dedication recently of the
$2,500,000 Nieuwland Science Hall.
Archbishop O’Hara blessed the struc-
ture which houses the latest classroom
and laboratory equipment for the De-
partments of Chemistry, Physics and
Mathematics.
A symposium on “The Development
of Science” with Dean Lawrence H.
Baldinger presiding opened the dedi-
catory program. Papers were given
by heads of departments: Rev. Henry
J. Bolger, C.S.C., Physics; Dr. An-
drew Boyle, Chemistry; and Dr. Ar-
nold E. Ross, Mathematics. Among
those attending this event and those
which followed were members of No-
tre Dame’s Advisory Council of
Science and Engineering who held
their Fall meeting on campus during
that weekend. Dr. E. C. Kleiderer,
executive director for research and
control of Eli Lilly and Co., Indian-
apolis, Ind., is chairman of the group
which includes twenty-nine nationally
prominent executives.
The principal speaker at the Uni-
versity convocation was Dr. George
E. Uhlenbeck, world renowned physi-
cist and faculty member at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. He received an
honorary Doctor of Science degree
from the Rev. Theodore M. Hes-
burgh, C.S.C., president of Notre
Dame. An impressive academic pro-
cession from the Administration Build-
ing to Washington Hall preceded the
convocation.
Dr. Uhlenbeck, a distinguished
physicist and teacher, came to this
cduntry from Holland in 1927. At
that time he was already recognized
as the discoverer of the electron spin.
Since then there is practically no field
of fundamental importance in physics
to which Dr. Uhlenbeck has not made
a significant and lasting contribution.
He has been a faculty member at the
University of Michigan for twenty
years and also has taught at the Uni-
versity of Utrecht, in Holland, and
at Columbia University.
The new building which was
erected through the generosity of
alumni and non-alumni friends was
opened for classes and research this
past September. Named after Father
Nieuwland it is an appropriate tribute
to the priest-scientist whose research
on a formula for synthetic rubber
helped the Allies win World War II
and provided many household articles
now commonly found in the Amer-
ican home. His original laboratory,
which became the scene for one of
the great chemical discoveries of the
20th Century is still preserved on the
campus. Dr. George F. Hennion,
Father Nieuwland’s nephew, continues
the work of his noted uncle in rubber
research. Father Nieuwland died in
1936 and is buried on the Notre
Dame campus.
Notre Dame’s College of Science
was begun in 1865. The present struc-
ture provides working space and
classroom facilities for students who
had been studying in over-crowded
conditions in the Old Chemistry
Building. Included in the Nieuwland
Science Hall are more than thirty
large laboratories, several amphithe-
atre-type classrooms, a library, con-
ference rooms and offices.
Music, Drama. Lectures
And Art Are Featured
In Week’s Program
by Robert Zeis
The author is a junior in the Col-
lege of Commerce and is majoring in
Journalism. He is from Kenton, O.
Notre Dame’s College of Liberal
and Fine Arts presented during the
week of October 12-17 a brilliant dis-
play of outstanding cultural events.
The week-long program of concerts,
lectures and dramatic presentations,
topped off by a million-dollar modern
art exhibit was enthusiastically re-
ceived by students, faculty and cam-
pus visitors. The Festival of the Arts,
as it was called, officially inaugurated
activities in the new I. A. O’Shaugh-
nessy Hall of Liberal and Fine Arts
which was dedicated last May.
Included in the modern art exhi-
bition were paintings by Raoul Dufy,
Paul Klee, Maurice Utrillo, Georges
Rouault and a score of other noted
artists. The paintings were assembled
from private collections and galleries
in the Midwest by John A. Muldoon,
Jr., Notre Dame alumnus and promi-
nent Chicago art collector.
Distinguished Moving Pictures
Beginning Monday afternoon and
continuing throughout Tuesday a
series of distinguished moving pictures
was shown on campus. The Louisiana
Story, a fine example of the docu-
mentary film, inaugurated this series
and was followed by two other mas-
terpieces; The Strong Man, a silent
comedy of the ’20’s and a perfect
example of pantomime and comedy,
and The Informer, the multiple Acad-
emy Award winner about the Irish
rebellion.
The first event of the Festival of
the Arts was a demonstration of sculp-

ture techniques by the Rev. Anthony
Lauck, G.S.C., of Notre Dame’s Art
department. Father Lauck, winner of
the national Sculptor of the Year
award, demonstrated the basic tech-
niques and methods of sculpturing
and sought to increase the enjoyment
and understanding of the art by the
layman.
The second day of the Festival of
the Arts coincided with Founder’s
Day, October 13th, a traditional cam-
pus holiday. A Solemn High Mass
in honor of the Rev. Edward F.
Sorin, C.S.C., founder and first presi-
dent of Notre Dame, was celebrated
in Sacred Heart Church in the
morning.
George Buehr Gave Art Demonstration
George Buehr, modern art author-
ity from Chicago’s Art Institute, gave
two interesting demonstrations on
Wednesday, the third day of the fes-
tival. In the early afternoon he con-
ducted a tour of the modern paint-
ings on exhibition in the O’Shaugh-
nessy galleries, and later gave a most
humorous and unusual lecture on
modern art. It was fascinating not
only to the artist but also to the per-
son who cannot understand modern
art to see an art critic drape spa-
ghetti across a piece of canvas, throw
a few tomatoes at it, and say, “That’s
modem art.”
On the same evening at 8 o’clock,
the University Theatre presented a
dramatic reading of Ibsen’s Hedda
Gabler. The cast, under the direc-
tion of Michael Casey, formerly of
London’s famed Old Vic Theatre and
now a Notre Dame professor, pre-
sented an experiment in Reader’s
Theatre. The production was a
unique experience in the theatre and
was well received by all in attendance.
Lecture by Richard Sullivan
On Thursday, Richard Sullivan,
noted novelist and short-story writer
and a member of Notre Dame’s Eng-
lish department since 1936, used as
his lecture topic, “The Intention of
the Novel.” He made clear the mean-
ing and purpose of fiction particu-

larly for the Catholic reader. Mr.
Sullivan’s latest novel, 311 Congress
Court, has been enthusiastically re-
ceived by both reviewers and the pub-
lic and his lecture cleared up many
readers’ problems regarding fiction
writing.
The Fine Arts Quartet from North-
western University, heard regularly
over the ABC Radio Network, pre-
sented a concert the evening of Octo-
ber 15th. Appearing under the aus-
pices of the University’s Concert and
Lecture Series, the quartet thrilled
the audience with the music of
Beethoven, Hayden and Pistol.
The Friday program was high-
lighted by an hour-long choral pro-
gram presented by the Notre Dame
Glee Club. This organization, known
to millions through its annual ap-
pearance on Ed Sullivan’s “Toast of
the Town” television show and its
coast-to-coast concert tours, presented
a variety of selections including Gau-
deamus Igitur, Crucifixus and Ave
Maria.
A colorful climax to Notre Dame’s
Festival of the Arts was the first Arts
and Letters College Ball, featuring
the music of Woody Heiman and his
orchestra. Prior to the Ball, students
and their guests attended the tradi-
tional pep rally and on Saturday saw
the “Fighting Irish” officially open
the home football season against the
University of Pittsburgh.
The success of this unusual presen-
tation of cultural events is due pri-
marily to the efforts of two seniors,
Duke Rank, Phoenix, Ariz., and
Francis X. Meaney, South Braintree,
Mass. They conceived the ideas and
with the aid of administration and
faculty personnel the Festival ma-
terialized.
A mixture of spaghetti and some tomatoes
on canvas was proclaimed modem art by
Mr. George Buehr an authority on the sub-
ject from Chicago’s famed Art Institute.

A Forum on the
PRACTICE OF LAW
A group of successful practitioners,
including lawyers from big firms in
big cities, lawyers from small firms in
smaller communities, general practi-
tioners and specialists, company law-
yers, labor lawyers, government law-
yers—in brief, a cross section of the
American Bar—assembled on the No-
tre Dame campus, recently, under the
auspices of the Student Law Associa-
tion for a special meeting with the
senior class.
These distinguished attorneys gave
students the benefit of their practical
experience on questions concerning
placement activities. The participants
included: Paul M. Butler, a 1927
Notre Dame graduate from South
Bend and Democratic national com-
mitteeman from Indiana; Clarence J.
Donovan, who received his law de-
gree from Notre Dame in 1931, and
is a former president of the N.D. Law
Alumni Association; Julius Holzberg,
a specialist in labor law and faculty
member at the University of Cincin-
nati’s College of Law; Merle H.
Miller, tax specialist and member of
the firm of Ross, McCord, Ice and
Miller, Indianapolis, Ind.; Edmund A.
Stephan, a Notre Dame graduate in
1933, and member of the law firm of
Mayer, Austrian and Platt, Chicago,
Ill.; and John W. Christensen, a spe-
cialist in corporate finance who is
associated with the law firm of
Gingher and Christensen, in Colum-
bus, O.
Subjects discussed involved the fol-
lowing questions: should a young
lawyer open his own office, join an
established law firm or seek a govern-
ment position? should he be a general
practitioner or a specialist? should he
practice, in his home town or move to
another community? should he enter
politics?
“A young lawyer should devote a
reasonable amount of his time and
talents to public and community ac-
tivities, including politics, but he
should not become a professional of-
fice-seeker,” Mr. Butler stated. Mr.
Donovan echoed Butler’s opinion de-
claring that “if a young lawyer goes
into politics immediately, he sacrifices
a lot of time which he should devote

looks for long. Even Brownson Hall,
named after him on the Notre Dame
campus, has ceased to exist and is
only a memory for students who were
freshmen years ago.
With all his faults, the fascinating
and interesting character, Orestes
Augustus Brownson truly merited the
words of Father Isaac Hecker, “His
love for Holy Church was supreme
and his faith was never dim. His
record will be great in the sight of
God.”

Mr. Holzberg cautioned that “if a
lawyer waits too long to enter poli-
tics, he will be middle aged and lack
the vigor necessary for strenuous pub-
lic service.”
The idea for the Forum on the
Practice of Law stemmed from a sug-
gestion made by William B. Jones, a
member of the firm of Hamilton and
Hamilton, Washington, D. C., and
formerly president of the Notre Dame
Law Association. Joseph O’Meara,
Dean of the College of Law, presided
at the meeting and introduced the
speakers.
The Student Law Association has
many important functions and each
year invites outstanding attorneys to
the Law School to help foster the pro-
fessional development of its members.
Also, the association operates the Law
School’s placement service with the
assistance of a faculty advisor and the
generous support of the Notre Dame
Law Association.
Fact Institute in College of Law
On Thursday, March 18, 1954, there will be an all-day Fact Insti-
tute in the Law School. The Institute will be under the direction of
Mr. H. H. Clegg, Assistant Director of the FBI in Charge of Train-
ing and Inspection. The purpose of the Institute will be to empha-
size the decisive role played by facts in legal controversies, to
explain the various investigative techniques and to indicate where
certain kinds of frequently needed information can be obtained. The
following subjects will be discussed by experts from the FBI:
“THE FACT FINDING JOB”
“FACT FINDING INTERVIEWS”
“SEARCHING FOR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE”
“FACT FINDING BY EXPERT ACCOUNTANTS”
“FACT FINDING BY SCIENTISTS”
“FACT FINDING IN CIVIL CASES”
A number of fact-finding films will also be shown.

The terminal itself was designed by
students in the School of Architecture
at the University. The building is
made of buff brick and is of contem-
porary design. It includes a glass en-
closed waiting-room for bus passen-
gers as well as offices for university
maintenance personnel. On one wall
is hung a huge bulletin board so that
students may keep posted on late
campus events during their moments
of waiting. Adorning the terminal is
a limestone sculpture of Saint Chris-
topher, patron of travelers, by Robert
Schwinn, a senior architecture student
from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Mr. Lewis is widely known for his
philanthropy, especially for the con-
struction of many Catholic mission
chapels in various parts of the coun-
try. He is the founder and board
chairman of the F. J. Lewis Manufac-
turing Company of Chicago. He is
also president of the Lewis School
of Aeronautics, vice-president of Cath-
olic Charities of Chicago, and a trus-
tee of the Lewis Maternity Hospital.
The Lewises traveled to the Uni-
versity for the dedication ceremonies
via their privately owned bright yel-
low helicopter which drew stares from
many campus visitors.
