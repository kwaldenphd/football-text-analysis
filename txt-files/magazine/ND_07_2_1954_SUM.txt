The Federal Bureau of Investigation
demonstrated investigative and fact-
finding techniques at an all-day Fact
Institute which was held under the
sponsorship of Notre Dame’s College of
Law*.
FBI methods and demonstrations for
^'getting the facts” in tracking down
criminals were presented to law stu-
dents by a staff of four highly skilled
agents. The program included films,
lectures and numerous exhibits.
The purpose of the institute accoid-
ing to Dean Joseph O'Meara. Jr., was
“to emphasize* the decisive role played
by facts in legal controversies, to ex-
plain the various investigative tech-
niques useful in both civil and criminal
cases and to indicate where certain
kinds of frequently needed information
can be obtained/’ Dean O'Meara in-
dicated that the Notre Dame Fact In-
stitute is believed to be the first of its
kind held in any law' school.
Included in the agenda were sessions
demonstrating the search for physical
evidence, the methods of fact-finding
interviews, science and crime detection,
photography and charting, fingerprint
identification and fact-finding by ex-
pert accountants. Two films were
shown. “A Day with the FBI’’
“Clollection and Preservation of
dence.”

Evi-
Notre Dame law students were told
that hard work by trained agents in the
way the FBI gathers facts and these
methods can be put to good use by any
other agency or persons seeking the
same objective.
Law enforcement has made tremen-
dous improvements in procedures over
the years and where advice formerlv
to the recruit was “Take care of vour
feet” the emphasis now is on proper
training methods.
Charles A. Donelan of the FBI head-
quarters training division. Washington.
D. C., listed four facets of fact-finding
at the scene of the crime which include
interviews, use of records, surveillance
and search for facts. The methods are
the same for civil or criminal investiga-
tion, he stated. Donelan emphasized
that the most common basic technique
in fact-finding is the use of the inter-
view. Only experience can produce
skill in interviewing and win the con-
fidence of the person who is giving the
answers, said Donelan.

Vol. 7 No. 2 Summer, 1954
The end of the school year means many things to many
people. To our proud graduates it means the end of one
road, the beginning of another. To our undergraduates the
end of the year means a going home, a summer away from
the grind of concentrated study. To our faculty it means a
short needed rest and the long, hot days of the summer
session.
Each of our halls, as you may know, has a rector and
several prefects. These men, who are our priests, welcome
the quiet that comes with the end of the school year. But
for them, too, the peace that comes from silent radios and
doors no longer slamming is all too short. Many of these
priests are inconvenienced by having to move from their own
quarters. The reason for this is that six or seven of our 14
residence halls are occupied in summer by conventions and
by Sisters who come for summer school.
The people in our administrative offices, like all who
teach and work on campus, are much in need of a rest by
the time June comes. Yet, campus life and campus activity
is a year-round process. This is why I am so grateful to all
who are part of Notre Dame. No amount of pay could
possibly compensate for what these wonderful people do
for the University. The magnitude of their spirit elevates
their talents into greatness.
Notre Dame, in summertime, is a City of Conventions.
Summer school goes on as usual, but we also welcome to our
campus a dozen or more conventions. These conventions are
welcomed by us because we feel these people deserve what-
ever we can offer. These conventions are gatherings of spir-
itual groups, of groups whose work is to further our Chris-
tian heritage. We are privileged to be able to offer them
the convenience of our location, the beauty of our campus,
the facilities of our buildings. We also feel that these groups,
when they leave us, take part of Notre Dame with them.
We want them to. We want them to become ambassadors
of Our Lady; we want them to join the Notre Dame family.
It is through the friends of Notre Dame that the story of
Notre Dame is brought to other hearts.
Between the Post Office and Badin Hall is a small
acreage of grassland referred to as “the bog.” This summer
“the bog” will become part of the past. Over this ground,
which at times looked like a small lake, a bookstore will be
built. Dear friends of ours. Mr. and Mrs. Romy Hammes
are sponsoring this structure. May the good Lord grant to
the Hammes family health and happiness for their lasting
tribute to a great cause.
A large campus requires large maintenance crews. Sev-
enteen hundred acres and fifty-five buildings reveal the
wear and tear of time and weather. Summertime merely
means more work for these crews. Ground crews are busy
with flowers and grass and shrubs; maintenance crews are
busy with repairing and painting and building. The wor-
ries of a school and the workings of a school extend beyond
our primary quest for truth and knowledge into the tangible
things of time like earth and brick and mortar.
All too soon the days of summer will have faded with
autumn. All too soon the present days with its dreams and
plans become part of the past. Not always are the dreams
fulfilled and the plans realized. This does not mean, of
course, that we cease to dream and refuse to plan.
Notre Dame was built on a dream which had its roots
in Faith. When dreams fail because of rushing time we
renew our Faith and point to things Eternal. A greater
Notre Dame will come from the same Faith that built the
past. It will come, too, from devotion to our many friends
without whose help plans can never reach maturity. To all
of you who are so much a part of us I pledge again our
prayers and love. May the good Lord and His Blessed
Mothei’ grant to you and yours many blessings.

PRE-PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING at
NOTRE DAME
The largest group among the under-
graduate students in the College of Sci-
ence at the University of Notre Dame
is made up of pre-professional students,
those who are planning to continue
their education in medicine, dentistry,
veterinary medicine, or in one of the
fields ancillary to these professions.
Each September, approximately sixty
per cent of the freshman class entering
this college are included in this group;
since but a third to a half of this group
eventually enter professional schools it
will be of interest to alumni and to par-
ents of prospective students for this
program to learn something of the rea-
sons for the apparent popularity of the
program, and to consider some of the
factors which may be responsible for
the high scholastic mortality in this
group.
In too many instances, the youngster
and his parents have mistaken a thinly-
rooted interest for a real aptitude in
medicine or dentistry; the popular mag-
azines, the daily press, radio and tele-
vision programs, have glamorized the
work of the healing professions, not al-




stressing sufficiently to the younger gen-
eration the arduous and long prepara-
tion necessary to enter them. Well-
meaning relatives, counsellors, high
school principals, the family doctor,
the comer druggist, and others are
often misguided by superior high school
records of these young people. These
grades do not always offer a favorable
prognosis for successful work on the
college level in the intensive science
courses preparatory to the study of
medicine or dentistry; too frequently,
these students find themselves short-
changed by their preparatory schools,
and by their parents as well, in that
they have not been taught how to
study, or have not been taught to ap-
portion their time so as to attain maxi-
mum efficiency. Since only a minority
of students entering college today have
a well-formed plan for their future ca-
reers plus the necessary background of
home discipline, fundamental prepara-
tory training, and good study habits to
attain the goal which they are seeking,
more than ever before in the training
of pre-professional students it is neces-
sary to use the various testing aids
available for determining the aptitudes
of these students, and to use the test
results for guiding them into those fields
where they have capabilities and for
which they have a genuine interest.
In selecting students for the pre-
professional programs, and this is true
for all science programs, the grades and
amount of contact with courses in Eng-
lish, foreign language — preferably
Latin ■—■ mathematics, the humani-
ties, and finally the sciences, are scru-
tinized carefully. Students who pre-
sent many credits in shop courses and
in the applied arts at the expense of
fundamental arts and science courses
are not regarded as being good risks in
the pre-professional program. It is in-
teresting to note that the Cooperative
English Test scores in the speed and
level of comprehension, in vocabulary,
mechanics and effectiveness of expres-
sion, are excellent predictive agents in
selecting promising pre-professional
students. Stated more succinctly, if a
young man can read well and rapidly,
understands what he is reading, and
can express himself well, in writing or
in speech, he should experience no
great difficulty in a pre-professional
program.
Pre-professional training at the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame has always in-
cluded a liberal proportion of the

humanities, social sciences, religion and
philosophy to supplement the funda-
mental science courses required by the
professional schools. Through the years
the program for these students has been
altered or modified from time to time
to meet the requirements and recom-
mendations of the medical and dental
schools, and to conform to the recom-
mendations of the Councils on Medical
and Dental Education of the American
Medical and Dental Associations.
According to the current Bulletin of
the College of Science the requirements
for the freshman in the pre-professional
program include courses in general zo-
ology, general chemistry and qualitative
analysis, general mathematics, rhetoric
and composition, life of Christ, and
Christian morals, in addition to a non-
credit course in physical education. In
the zoology course the would-be medi-
co gets his first experience in catalog-
ing and retaining in his memory a great
many biological terms, and in freshman
chemistry he is rudely awakened to the
fact that “my high school course was
never like this.” Mathematics pro-
vides mental discipline in addition to
the proper background for college phy-
sics, which follows in the sophomore
year. For students who show a pro-
ficiency in English, plans are in opera-
tion to permit these boys to go directly
into sophomore courses in this subject.
The same holds for mathematics; stu-
dents may go directly into the calculus
if their achievement tests indicate the
proper skills with fundamental mathe-
matics. It is poor pedagogy for a stu-
dent to repeat work which he has
already completed, but it is his respon-
sibility to show that he can handle
work on a higher level.
In the sophomore year the program
includes apologetics, dogma, organic
chemistry, physics, comparative anat-
omy and embryology, and foreign lan-
guage (French, German, or Spanish).
Chemistry serves as a background
for future studies in anatomy, physiol-
ogy, embryology, etc., physics finds ap-
plication in all phases of medicine and
dentistry, and the languages contribute
cultural as well as utilitarian values.
To counterbalance the intensitv of the
y
courses in the sophomore year, students
are permitted to defer one of the sci-
ences until the junior year.
In the last two years the student
completes twenty-two (22) more hours
of science of his own choosing plus suf-
ficient credit hours in the non-science
list

courses to meet the 132-hour require-
ment for graduation. In these years he
is offered a great deal of latitude in
selecting his courses; usually he has
done some investigating on his own
about the requirements and recommen-
dations of the medical school or schools
of his choice, and he can be depended
upon to show a reasonable degree of
maturity in arranging his own program.
To help the student in his choice of
medical or dental schools, a complete
file of medical and dental school cata-
logs is maintained in the office of the
dean. In this collection will be found
the publications of the Association of
Medical Colleges which list in concise
and well-tabulated form data concern-
ing the class A schools in the country;
also included are current books, publi-


cations, and pamphlets concerning the
healing professions. Also available for
interested students are current copies
and bound volumes of the Journal of
the Association of American Medical
Colleges in the science library, and of
the Journal of the American Medical
Association in the biology library. The
Aesculapian Club, the campus under-
graduate pre-professional organization,
regularly brings speakers from the pro-
fessions to speak to the students, and
also sponsors several social events each
year.
In the upper-level years, pre-profes-
sional students at Notre Dame select
with proper guidance courses in litera-
ture, advanced composition, psycholo-
gy, logic, ethics, sociology, economics,
art, journalism, speech, music, business
law, accounting, a foreign language,
and in the sciences, to complete their
programs. Those who are charged with
the responsibility of directing these pre-
professional students feel confident that
sound fundamental training in the hu-
manities and in the sciences, and espe-
cially in a religious atmosphere such
as is obtained here at Notre Dame, will
provide competent young men for pro-
fessional training who will become men
and citizens of breadth and wisdom as
well as learned and skillful doctors, and
who can therefore bring to troubled
patients a steadying influence for which
there is no substitute. No one today
will deny the desperate need for men
trained in science and technology; no
one will deny that such individuals
need far more intensive training than
the generation before them; but most
important at present is the need for
men in science and technology, equip-
ped not only with good fundamental
training but also imbued with spiritual
values to meet the full impact of the
implications of science, and also pos-
sessed with a firm spiritual resolve
backed by moral strength. The doctor
needs extrinsic and intrinsic education:
the former he acquires in the medical
college; the latter includes education
of self and extends throughout life. It
includes the knowledge of self regard-
ing the responsibilities to patients, to
the medical profession and to society; it
concerns the appreciation of the rights
of individuals, the sacredness of the
human body, and the spirituality of
man.
Danger signals in the freshman pre-
professional student’s college career be-
come apparent within six weeks after
8 Notre Dame
he enters college, sometimes earlier,
usually in the chemistry or in the zoolo-
gy course, often in both. Poor study
habits, inadequate background, lack of
a genuine interest, inability or reluc-
tance to buckle down to hard work,
homesickness — these are only a few
of the factors which may be responsible.
At this time, the services of the Depart-
ment of Guidance and Testing are en-
listed to supplement the data acquired
through the tests administered early in
the semester, and to aid the boy and
his parents in planning his future,
either to remedy the factors which are
responsible for his poor showing, or to
help him get into a program for which
he has the proper ability and a genuine
interest.
We feel a moral responsibility to stu-
dents and to parents, to the profession,
and to the medical schools, to screen as
judiciously and accurately as possible
these students prior to the end of the
sophomore year, or earlier, where the
need is indicated. It is a matter of
saving in money for the parents, in ef-
fort and pride for the students, and in
energy for ourselves. No attempt is
made to coerce the boy into changing
his course or to force the parents to re-
vise their plans for his career as a result
of these tests, but it is significant to
note that many youngsters who have
been diverted into programs where
their aptitudes are commensurate with
their interests, are much happiei' and
do much better work.
To answer a question frequently di-
rected to the office of the registrar or
to the dean, Notre Dame does not serve
as a preparatory school for any one par-
ticular school of medicine. The Bulle-
tin of the College of Science states that
the proper selection of courses in the
program leading to the degree of bach-
elor of science will qualify the student
to apply for admission to any school of
medicine. The acceptance of a student
into a medical school, however, is based
as a rule upon four factors: 1) his aca-
demic record, 2) his score in the Medi-
cal College Admission Test adminis-
tered a year before he enters medical
school, 3) his personal interview, and
4) the letters of recommendation from
his teachers. As a rule, an honors-
average of 85% or better will give the
student a good chance of being accept-
ed, although in many instances the
score in the admissions test is of equal
importance.
In this country and in Canada there
One of the most brilliant students of
science at Notre Dame was Dr. Charles
A. Hufnagel, ’37. He has perfected an
unusual and successful method that
makes surgery possible for theretofore
hopeless heart cases. Several years ago
he was selected as cone of the 10 out-
standing young men1 in the nation.
Dr. Robert A. Nelson, member of
Notre Dame’s 1944 class, is spending a
year and a half at the Pasteur Institute,
near Paris, France, doing research un-
der a private grant. Dr. Nelson was

search Award last Fall for developing

medical schools, and a smaller number
of recognized dental schools. The rec-
ords for the past twenty-five years show
that our students scatter to the four

The 1954 Pulitzer Prize for drama
was awarded to the Broadway play,
“The Teahouse of the August Moon,”
adapted from a novel by Vern Sneider,
graduate of the 1940 class at Notre
Dame.
This was the third honor this season
for “Teahouse.” It previously won the
New York Drama Critics Circle and
Antoinette Perry awards.
He was born in Monroe, Michigan,
a fourth generation member of a Ba-
varian immigrant family, who fled
Europe in 1848. Vern began to write
in high school, and while in college did
radio plays and was a reporter on the
student news-weekly. He almost gave
VERN SNEIDER
up a promising writing career for a po-
sition in the business world with Sears,
Roebuck and Co., iust prior to World
War II.
Vern’s military hitch was varied but
not too different from a lot of other
GI’s — that is the first three and one-
half years of it. In turn he became a
machine gunner, a rifleman, an artillery
man, a private, corporal, acting ser-
geant and finally an officer.
In September of 1944, Vern was
transferred to Military Government
from an intelligence reconnaissance
platoon. At that time plans were under-
way for an invasion and the place to be
invaded was Formosa. For months the
group studied Formosa; the land, the
people, the vegetation, the resources —
in brief, ever bit of information that
was obtainable.
After setting sail it sometimes hap-
pened in those days that pre-arranged
plans were subject to change without
too much advance notice. So Vern
and his fellow GI’s landed on Okinawa
— instead of Formosa — with the in-
vasion forces. In a couple of days he
was in command of a native village
called Tobaru.
Vern inherited a family of 5,000
hungry and homeless Okinawan peo-
ple. Headquarters said, “Take care of
them.” There was a noticeable absence
of an interpreter, and relief supplies
had not arrived. And what happened
in Tobaru Village during the next six
months is what happened in Tobiki
Village in “The Teahouse of the Au-
gust Moon.”
The characters involved in the nov-
el and play are a group of American
Army officers who have come to Oki-
nawa to convert the native to Western
ways. And a considerable number of
the islanders, who, having been con-
quered and civilized by a good many
people in the past, including British
missionaries and Japanese expansion-
ists, have developed a somewhat de-
tached attitude toward salvation. An
Army captain, who is an ex-college pro-
fessor, is sent to the village of Tobiki
with instructions to deliver a series of
lectures on democracy and to build a
schoolhouse shaped like the Pentagon.
Although the natives are hospitable
they show no real enthusiasm for a
schoolhouse, preferring instead a tea-
house, where they can relax and take
off their shoes.
“The Teahouse of the August Moon”
was published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons
and it received practically unanimous
praise from the critics. In a review
Lewis Gannett of the New York Her-
ald Tribune said, “Remember that
name — Vern Sneider.” Before the
book had been out a year it won the
annual award of the Friends of Ameri-
can Writers, a prize offered for the best
novel by a midwestemer. Then the
rights were sold to MGM and later the
play opened on Broadway.
He considers Monroe, Mich., as
home but likes New York in the Fall
and Winter. His working hours usual-
ly begin around 10 in the evening and
he does ten pages a night on a novel,
two on a short story. This routine
often lasts until 4 in the morning. He
says, “If I try working by hours, I
get nothing done.”
Some day Vem hopes to be able to
pursue his desire to run a farm or nur-
sery — it would be an ideal combina-
tion, operating the farm by daylight
and writing at night, he thinks.
Football remains a consuming pas-
sion with him, and he follows the
Fighting Irish each autumn in person
or via radio/TV. He and his wife re-
cently left for London where “Tea-
house” will be staged.
Vern Sneider’s tremendous success
reflects his early training on the Notre
Dame campus. He wrote to the Rev.
Eugene P. Burke, G.S.C., one of Notre
Dame’s distinguished priest-teachers,
“. . . the play is staged in the form of
a fable — with the tone being a min-
gling of fantasy and realism. And you
know that a big part of this started in
Freshman Rhetoric, when you encour-
aged us to use our imaginations; and
for that I’ll always be grateful.”

In May 1950, Notre Dame’s Electri-
cal Engineering and Mathematics de-
o o
partments secured a research contract
from the United States Air Force to
study characteristics of certain non-
linear circuit elements.
This may not mean too much to
many people, but to the United States
Air Force—the branch which may be
the difference between victory and de-
feat should there be another war—it
means a lot.
Elementary arithmetic reveals that at
speeds of 600 mph, two combat air-
planes approach each other at the rate
of a mile every three seconds. Obvi-
ously, little or no time remains for ac-
tual firing at the target before it has
passed . . . unless, of course, the pilot
is aided by some type of electronic fire
control and directioning system.
The increasing speed of aircraft pre-
sents similar problems to the automatic
gun tracking systems used on naval ves-
sels. Accuracy dictates that not only
must the plane be sighted far enough
ahead of time to compensate for its
extremely rapid motion, but compensa-
tion must also be made for the ship’s
rolling.
Obviously, this linear system of de-
tection leaves much to be desired. By
the time the line has stopped wavering
and has finally been stabilized on the
target^ or has gradually descended to
the target, a great amount of time has
been consumed—too much time for
gun target directors confronted with
today’s jet-powered, supersonic-speed
aircraft.
This is where the non-linear system
comes in. About the best way to de-
scribe non-linear is to say that it is the
opposite of linear—that is, it does not
act according to the linear laws or rules
of mathematics.
।	Now, if the non-linear system could
' be worked out so that the line from the
gun position would go directly to the
target without the least hesitation, then
the non-linear system would be a suc-
cess. This is the job of Doctor H. E.
Ellithorn of the University’s electrical
engineering department, who is head
of the experimental research group,
and of researchers in other places
throughout the country—to perfect the
non-linear system.
The original research contract, which
was for $88,000, expired this past
March and a new contract calling for
$23,000 through the next eleven
months was immediately drawn up.
Since 1950, over a dozen graduate
student theses and departmental reports
leading to Masters Degrees have been
written about non-linear circuit ele-
ment research at Notre Dame. Addi-
tional technical papers have been pre-
sented in New York and various other
f	localities regarding these studies.
|	These findings have been incorpor-
:	ated into a record log by Dr. Ellithorn
(	which now exceeds 400 pages. As he
(1	points out, each time a paper is written
on some phase of the research, some
<■1 new problem crops up.
|,	The scope of the research itself has
been fundamental in nature, involving
11 basic physics, chemistry, and mathe-
matics, and dealing with the solid state
|	structure of various elementary compo-
i	nents.
a
i	The University’s math department
!	has been invaluable in its consulting
II	service, according to Dr. Ellithorn. Dr.
j A. J. Ross, the original project director,
- Fr. Henry DeBaggis, his successor, and
|	Dr. J. P. LaSalle have conducted sem-
inars and supplied theoretical guidance.
I Prof. Rene DeVogelaere has assisted
|	in the work being done.
ij	The non-linear system has unlimited
|| peacetime possibilities, whether it be in
p	speeding automatic control in machine
|!	shops and mills or in eliminating the
L rebound from overhead garage doors.
(
Pre-Professional Training
(Continued from page 8)
comers of the continent, and some have
gone abroad to continue their profes-
sional studies; a small number have
entered the field of osteopathy, and
only a few have gone into veterinary
medicine.
Since several medical schools will
consider for acceptance superior stu-
dents who have completed three years
of pre-professional work, several of our
promising juniors each year gain ad-
mittance to these institutions. In the
case of dental schools, many students
can gain admission after completing
satisfactorily two years of pre-profes-
sional training. These boys forfeit the
chance to obtain a degree from Notre
Dame unless they return during the
summer sessions to earn additional
credits, but they may become bona fide
members of the Alumni Association by
applying through the proper channels.
Regulations permitting, they may ob-
tain the bachelor’s degree at the pro-
fessional school after they have com-
pleted the prescribed number of credits
in that school.
This note of explanation concerning
pre-professional training at Notre Dame
would not be complete without a word
of thanks and tribute to those whose
work and efforts contribute much to
the training and counselling of our pre-
professional students. In the Depart-
ment of Biology, Rev. Robert Sheehan,
C.S.C., Head, and Mr. Donald J.
Plunkett, Assistant Head, aided by Drs.
Mizelle, Dineen, Chalkley, and Stokely,
lead these students through their ele-
mentary courses in the biological sci-
ences; in the Department of Chemistry,
Drs. Boyle, Hinton, Hennion, Brother
Columba, and the writer make an ef-
fort to unveil the intricacies of chemis-
try; in the Department of Physics, Rev.
Hemy J. Bolger, C.S.C., Head, with
Father Richard Murphy, G.S.C., and
Dr. Robert Anthony have taken a spe-
cial interest in the pre-professional stu-
dents and in presenting physics to them
as a useful tool and background for the
study of medicine; in the Department
of Mathematics, Dr. Arnold Ross,
Head, and his staff are paying particu-
lar attention to the needs and prob-
lems of the pre-professional group. To
these and many more on the faculty,
both religious and lay, go sincere thanks
for cooperation and interest in training
these boys.

June 5, 1954
To Notre Dame Alumni and Friends:
I would like to call to your attention the general facilities
of the Morris Inn,
Football, Commencement, Class Dance weekends, the weekends of
Trustee, Advisory Council or convention meetings, are obviously
periods of impossible conflicts in general patronage.
But alumni are finding —• and this is what I want to pass alon;
that on most of the days of the year, the lovely facilities of the
Inn are available to the traveling alumnus, to his family,
and business associates.
Many alumni, in the neighboring area, are finding that the Inn,
provides a comfortable retreat that can be as spiritual, as intellectual,
or as physically restful, as they want to make it. Church, chapels,
library, faculty and administrative contacts, — or just the beauty of the
campus and the appointments of the Inn — create one of the most
colorful backgrounds a Notre Dame man will find anywhere.
No visit to the Inn, especially under the suggested circumstances,
can fail to strengthen the ties of a Notre Dame man to the campus,
or to bring to his family and his associates a richer understanding
of his enthusiasm and his loyalty. This was one of E. M. Morris’ beliefs
and hopes.
That is my reason for proposing the Morris Inn for your own
consideration.

NOTRE DAME CLUB of DETROIT
2 BUHL BLDG. • DETROIT 26, MICH. • WOodward 3-6700
The largest single gift, received to date, from Notre Dame's
Alumni Clubs for the Distinguished Professors Program is a generous
contribution of $1400 given by Detroit alumni.
At a recent meeting of the club's Board of Directors the group
unanimously voted to assist the University's current project. Detroit, one of
Notre Dame's most active alumni clubs, is also providing funds for a
scholarship program.
Total gifts from the club during the past four years have
amounted to more than $6,000. In addition to furnishing financial aid
for Notre Dame, Detroit has maintained a consistently fine
year-around number of club events.
This benefaction is directly related to the announcement by the
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president, to supplement the
present faculty with 45 additional, outstanding teachers.
Corporations, especially, have been invited to participate in underwriting
the Distinguished Professors Program.
