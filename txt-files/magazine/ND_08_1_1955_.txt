FAC U LTY
DEVELOPMENT
Fourteen Distinguished Professors Appointed
Financial support in 1954 from cor-
porations and other generous benefac-
tors has made possible the addition of
fourteen distinguished professors to the
Notre Dame faculty, according to a
recent announcement by the Rev.
Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., presi-
dent. In a progress report Father Hes-
burgh listed the new faculty members
in three categories: 1) Lecture series
or occasional lectures; 2) Semester ap-
pointments; 3) Permanent appoint-
ments.
The fourteen distinguished profes-
sors are the first group of an antici-
pated 45 to augment Notre Dame’s
present faculty under the provisions of
a special program inaugurated last
year at the University. At that time
Father Hesburgh invited corporations
to participate in a plan for obtaining
additional, outstanding teachers on the
Notre Dame staff. As originally out-
lined, this program would cost a mini-
mum of $450,000 annually.

Ivan Mestrovic is an internationally
famous sculptor and has been profes-
sor and sculptor in residence at Syra-
cuse University since 1947. He is re-
garded as the outstanding living
O	o	o
sculptor of religious subjects and his
works in stone, wood and clay can be
found in museums, private collections,
churches and parks from Belgrade to
Chicago. A bronze sculpture of the
crucified Christ by Mestrovic is in the
foyer of the O’Shaughnessy Hall of
Liberal and Fine Arts at Notre Dame.
One of the artist’s more recent projects
consisted of 29 panels on the Life of
, Christ which he sent to Yugoslavia as
his gift to the Croatian people. His
works have been included in interna-
tional exhibitions for nearly 50 years.
Among them are many sculptures of
Christ, the Blessed Mother and the
saints as well as more recent portraits
of Pope Pius XII, Cardinal Stepinac,
former president Herbert Hoover and
the late president of Czechoslovakia,
Jan Masaryk. He was educated at the
Art Academy in Vienna and the first
exhibition of his early works in that
city attracted considerable attention.
Professor Mestrovic became an Amer-
ican citizen after coming to this coun-
try during the latter part of World
War II.
Progress of the Distinguished Pro-
fessors Program developed last Sum-
mer when Father Hesburgh and the
Rev. Paul E. Beichner, G.S.C., Dean
of the Graduate School, visited fifteen
European universities. Simultaneously
a Committee on Faculty, headed by
the Rev. Philip S. Moore, C.S.C.,
Vice-President in Charge of Academic
Affairs, explored the possibilities of
new faculty appointments for this pro-
gram in the United States.
In 1955, Notre Dame will continue
the projection of a Faculty Develop-
ment Program and again depend on
the generosity of American business to
assist, financially, in the advancement
of this worthwhile academic cause.
The partnership between Notre Dame
and industry is another symbol in the
struggle to combat the scourge of com-
munism with young men who are mor-
ally educated.

Notre Dame
At Notre Dame we are trying to engender in our young
men a real sense of moral responsibility. We say this largely
in reference to the social areas that will form the context of
our students’ lives following graduation. America today is
on the brink of a great adventure. We hope that the young
men whom we are educating at Notre Dame will be pre-
pared to take a key part in directing that adventure.
This training begins the day a student arrives at the
University. Here the boy can immediately recognize de-
mocracy in action. He is living with hundreds of other
boys from all over America. There are no special groups.
Each boy must win acceptance by what he is himself. His
father’s wealth or lack of it does not matter—living quarters
are equal for all. He must learn to be a part, and a con-
tributing part, of a larger group. To the extent that he
succeeds, he will have good friends all over America in the
years to come. All student activities, including student
government, are open to all with no distinctions regarding
social background, race, or religious preferences. One Pro-
testant boy rose to our highest lay distinction of becoming
in later years the Chairman of our Associate Board of Lay
Trustees. Another became President of our Alumni Asso-
ciation. A poor boy, who worked his way through school,
later joined the Congregation of Holy Cross and became
President of the University.
The boys learn early that what really matters is what
kind of a person they are, not what kind of a car their
father drives.
In this atmosphere, a boy perceives that he cannot merely
think of himself through life, that the social responsibility
of leadership is one of the greatest opportunities that Amer-
ica affords. We try to develop this challenge of leadership,
and to direct it towards the three great areas that face our
students upon graduation.
The first and most basic opportunity for moral respon-
sibility is in marriage and family life. Preparation here is
of the essence. We have a Marriage Institute each Spring
for our graduating seniors. In an eight-week session, we try
to link the very real responsibilities of family life to the high
honor and dignity of Christian marriage. Here is social
life in its basic form. We discuss the all-important decision
of choosing a qualified and capable life partner, the char-
acteristics that make a good husband who will be worthy of
the best kind of wife, the many practical factors and lasting
human values that enter into successful family living. One
wife wrote that the best thing she could say about Notre
Dame is that it produces good husbands and fathers. We
do hope that most of our graduates will first distinguish
themselves this way, because here is moral responsibility that
will touch the heart of America and keep it sound.
The second area we emphasize is responsible leadership
in business and professional life. Here we point out to the
students that the world does not owe them a living, but
only an opportunity to prove that they can make a living
by intelligent and purposeful effort. There is no substitute
for hard work, competitive endeavor, and integrity. We
want our men to be good not only for themselves, but good
for the others in their business or professional groups. This
calls for the discipline that is part of Notre Dame life, to
five not as a passive unit, but as a contributing part of a
larger group that is perfected by cooperative effort, team-
work, and responsible leadership. We want Notre Dame
men to be respected and liked for their sense of organiza-
tion and their spirit of contribution to the good of the whole.
Lastly, we insist that moral and social responsibility has
a large part to play today in civic life—be it on the local,
state, or national level. We hear so many people decrying
corruption in political life and damning the cancerous spread
of Communism. We, too, condemn these things, but cannot
think that condemnation alone will help matters. The
negative approach does not fill the gap. Moreover, it is
largely pessimistic and frustrating. The world today needs
intelligent and responsible leadership more than negative
condemnation. We hope that our graduates will make
some positive contribution to the political well-being of our
local, state, and national life by actively participating in
political action. Once more, here is a duty that is better
viewed as an opportunity to serve. Here again, the future
of America is at stake. We cannot have a first-rate country
if it is run by second-rate public servants. Only men of
intelligence, moral integrity, and devotion to ideals can keep
this country attuned to the fine traditions that have made
it great among the nations.
The seniors at Notre Dame make only one parting gift
to the University—an American flag that flies over the
campus during the year following their graduation. We
accept it as a symbol of their loyalty. To this day, we have
never been shamed by disloyalty in any of them. We hope
we never will.

Notre Dame
NOTRE DAME IS ONE OF FIVE
According to a recent issue of
Television Factbook, FCC, Notre
Dame is one of five educational
institutions owning commercial
television stations. The other four
are: Butler University, Indianap-
olis, Ind.; Iowa State College,
Ames, Iowa; St. Norbert College,
Green Bay, Wis.; and the Univer-
sity of Missouri, Columbia, Mo.
In a half-century of achievement
the pendulum of scientific progress on
* Notre Dame’s campus has swung from
the first wireless message transmitted
I in this country to a modern-day com-
mercial television station.
On Feb. 22, 1955, Father Theodore
M. Hesburgh, C.S.G., president of
Notre Dame, turned a spadeful of
earth for what may conceivably be the
most far-reaching and ambitious pro-
ject in the history of the University, a
commercial TV station. In less than
six months the $35,000, 538-foot tower
rising out of the terrain near South
Bend will be beaming a television
signal into 140,000 receivers in and
around the city. On the campus a
complete, modem TV plant will have
$750,000 (including the above $35,-
-000 for the tower) worth of cameras,
lighting, control panels, sound pick-
ups, projection and transmitting
equipment, sets and the like to handle
a full day’s programming for the 6500
square miles in the station’s range.
“This is WNDU-TV, Channel 46,
Notre Dame,” a voice will say.
TV Is Educational Medium
The story of just how and why Notre
Dame has entered the highly competi-
tive field of commercial television be-
।	gan to crystalize in June, 1952, when
j	the Federal Communications Commis-
1	sion allotted South Bend one of 242
I	new educational channels. It had been
।	obvious to Notre Dame officials for
I	some time that television was probably
l	the most potent form of communica-
J	tion in the history of the world and that
its possibilities as an educational me-
dium were almost unlimited. They
’	could not fail to note, too, the desper-
ate need for capable and responsible
leadership in the industry. The golden
opportunity having presented itself in
the FCC action, the University admin-
istration was determined not to pass it
by without at least an examination.
Father Hesburgh and Father Ed-
o
mund P. Joyce, C.S.C., executive vice-
president, did a good deal of the bush-
beating themselves in trying to deter-
mine the feasibility of television at
Notre Dame. The undesirable aspects
of an educational television station
quickly came to the fore under their
examination. It was expensive, for
one thing, to start and operate since
by-laws of the FCC forbid such a sta-
tion to sell advertising. There would
be a sharp limitation, for another, on
the types of shows the University could
produce. “It is a major achievement
to put on just three hours of really
good educational television a week,”
says Father Joyce in retrospect, “and
that isn’t what I call getting our
money’s worth out of the equipment.”
In addition to this, the administra-
tion felt that Notre Dame could neither
be of substantial help in establishing
a workable set of standards for the
industry nor could it train young men
efficiently under such a limited pro-
gram. Since, at this time, there was
little precedent in the field of educa-
tional television, the University’s offi-
cials took a pretty dim view of the
whole enterprise and began to look
elsewhere.
Michiana Telecasting Corp.
Father Hesburgh and Father Joyce
noted that South Bend had been grant-
ed three television channels in all, two
ultra-high frequency commercial chan-
nels in addition to the educational fran-
chise. One had already gone to the
South Bend Tribune, known as radio
station WSBT, but the other was still
open, although two applicants, the
South Bend Broadcasting and the
South Bend Telecasting Companies,
had applied for it. The possibilities
of a commercial station with a com-
bination schedule of educational and
recreational shows was apparent.
Notre Dame officials believed that
if they got the other commercial fran-
chise, they could meet WSBT-TV’s
first-rate competition with a good net-
work affiliation and obtain substantial
contracts of network advertising.
Taking a chance on winning the chan-
nel grant, they formed the Michiana
Telecasting Corporation, with all stock
owned by the University, and applied
to the FCC in September, 1952.
Whenever there are two or more
applicants for a single channel, the
FCC must decide which applicant will
render the most community service.
Often this results in a hearing of many
weeks. Fortunately for the Notre Dame
contingent, this question was never
brought before the Commission since
the South Bend Telecasting Company
dropped out of contention soon after
the hearings were begun and the South
Bend Broadcasting Company withdrew
its application when the rights to its
South Bend radio properties were
bought by the University. The radio
station will be operated in conjunction
with the television station on the cam-
pus; a combined set-up not only has
proved to be economical, but profit-
able in other locales.
Barth Selected As Manager
And so on August 13, 1954, almost
two years after it had submitted its ap-
plication to the FCC, the University of
Notre Dame was granted the television
franchise to channel 46 in South Bend.
In the next month, WNDU-TV’s
managerial post attracted many of the
industry’s top people. Bernard C.
Barth, then program director for the
Crosley network in Ohio, was selected
and made vice-president-general mana-
ger of the Michiana Corporation. At
thirty-five Barth was already a veteran
of eighteen years in communications
work, and a specialist in programming,
the primary interest of the University
in a manager.
Starting out in 1936 as a vocalist for
KOTA in Rapid City, South Dakota,
he had worked his way up to program
director in three years. From then
until he became connected -with the
Crosley Corporation seven years ago,
Barth wrote, produced, directed, and
announced for stations in Cincinnati,
Texas, North Carolina, and the Phila-
delphia Inquirer outlet, WFIL. With
the Crosley network, considered by
many to be the finest television opera-
tion in the country, Barth moved up
from producer-director and program
director for WLW-TV, Cincinnati, to
program coordinator for the network.
Before becoming the network program
director, he was for two years execu-
tive assistant to the vice-president,
during which time he bought all the
film properties for the network and
handled the largest number of network
properties outside of New York.
Barth was at work here within a
month after his appointment. An
affiliation had already been worked out
with the National Broadcasting Com-
pany which enabled him to concentrate
Vol. 8 • No. I
7
on the station itself and the type of
shows to be presented.
Barth began immediately to shop for
three things, a piece of property well
out of the way of the airline passing
over the campus on which to build the
TV tower, a chief engineer, and a
sales manager.
The first he found south of the city
limits at the comer of Ironwood and
Kern roads. The particular advantage
of this location is that it is on a direct
line with WSBT-TV’s tower and so
(L to R): Bernard C. Barth, general mana-
ger and vice-president of campus TV sta-
tion; Father Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C.,
University executive vice-president; William
T. Hamilton, sales manager; and George
B. Smith, chief engineer.
television antennas in South Bend will
not have to be rotated for better re-
ception when changing channels.
George Smith, who has laid out and
set up three TV stations (UHF-VHF),
was picked by Barth as chief en-
gineer. Smith, like Barth, had been
in communications work for eighteen
years, but on the technical end of it.
He was the chief engineer for the
George Storer television stations, one
of the largest privately owned TV
operations in the country, before com-
ing to Notre Dame.
The all-important post of sales
manager was filled last month by Wil-
liam Thomas Hamilton, formerly a
sales executive with the Columbia
Broadcasting System. Hamilton has
been in sales-advertising circles for
twenty years and has a seat on the
Board of Governors of the Radio and
Television Executives Society.
Barth and his staff found South
Bend to be almost unique in the tele-
vision industry. All three of the South
Bend channels are on the ultra-high
frequency band which requires a $35
converter on a regular set. Although
o	o
there is only one UHF station on the
air in South Bend, at least 92% of the
140,000 sets in the area are converted.
A second channel will probably in-
crease this percentage in a short time.
The Notre Dame station, which will
be telecasting by mid-summer, is being
constructed on a lot adjacent to old
Vetville Recreation Hall at the north-
east comer of the campus. The simple,
one-story structure, easily added to, will
contain a single studio 80 feet long and
60 feet wide, a film projection room,
a control room, and the main offices.
The studio will be similar to most
commercial stations. A battery of three
cameras will be used in the building;
one will be strictly a studio camera but
the other two will be combination in-
door-outdoor mobile cameras. Most of
the lighting will be on trolleys to facili-
tate moving from one set to another
in the back-to-back floor plan, and
sound pick-up equipment will consist
of a pair of boom microphones plus a
number of suspended ‘mikes’. All of
the equipment is RCA’s latest design
and is capable of transmitting net-
work color programs.
Tower Transmitter
A saucer-shaped disk will beam the
studio’s signal into a similar disk
attached to the powerful 12% kw
tower transmitter outside the city. The
transmitter, in addition to housing the
major transmitting equipment, will
also encompass in its plans an emer-
.gency film and announcer studio.
Barth believes the most effective type
of television to be a ‘simple, whole-
some vehicle, well publicized.’ He
cites as examples Bishop Sheen and the
comedian George Gobel,
who literally
couldn’t give their shows away to begin
with but who are now much in demand
by all the networks. The Notre Dame
station will, then, feature a few key
personalities who will be versatile
enough to do various types of shows.
“I think we can get good talent all
right,” says Barth, “because a lot of the
name entertainers have tired of the
tremendous pressure and competition
in the big cities. They are now seeing
that the almighty dollar just isn’t worth
the peace of mind.”
The studio will probably have a full-
day programming at its outset but the
only “live” shows will be the service
variety, such as news, weather reports,
and the like. Gradually the schedule
of “live” shows will expand until a
number of programs, both of the edu-
cational type and for entertainment
will emanate from the campus.
“We’re not interested in putting just
anything on the air, we want quality,
real quality, something we can be
proud to put the Notre Dame stamp
on/’ Barth says. The thinking behind
this is that if enough good, wholesome
shows are successful on the air, the
public will demand them and the in-
dustry will soon have a workable set of
standards to guide it.
Training TV Administrators
The second half of the program, the
training of capable and responsible
television administrators, will begin in
a small way when the station opens. A
limited number of students will be em-
ployed in the studio as prop men, boom
men, cameramen assistants and the
like. Chosen almost entirely on the
basis of ability, about twenty-five stu-
dents will be rotated among the avail-
able jobs and those who prove them-
selves will be moved up to more
skilled and responsible positions.
The ultimate aim of the station is
to expand into one of the largest and
best equipped television centers in the
country, with duplicates in most of the
equipment strictly for student use. The
station will be the focal point of a
new Department of Communication
Arts, which is even now in the planning
stages and may become a reality with-
in the next three years. All profits from
the station over and above what is
needed to operate and buy new equip-
ment will be used for the establishment
of this department which will be an
enterprise almost as costly as the station
itself.
And so Notre Dame is embarking on
a practically unexplored field in educa-
tion. The next few years will decide
how successful it will be. There is
much to be learned and much to be
done, little time and not always enough
money.
Nevertheless, Barth says frankly,
“Sure and although the staff realizes
there’s a tough road ahead with a lot
of sharp turns in it, nevertheless they
are confident that the job will be done
well.” Station WNDU-TV, Channel
46, is just around the dial!

by James E. Murphy
The author is Director of Public In-
formation at Notre Dame and a fre-
quent contributor to this magazine.
Calling the dean a “wise guy” is
hardly an auspicious beginning for a
student’s four years at college. Never-
theless, that’s the way a Notre Dame
dean was greeted recently by a foreign
student who had just arrived in the
United States.
“I’m very pleased to meet you, sir,”
the student said. “I’ve heard you are
a wise guy,” he added, smiling con-
fidentally.
The student, of course, meant no
offense to the educator. In fact, he
thought “wise guy” meant a very in-
telligent person. The incident illus-
trates the language difficulty which
many foreign students experience when
they enroll in American colleges and
universities.
To help foreign students overcome
the language barrier, the University of
Notre Dame offers a special course de-
signated “English 11-X.” It differs
from the regular freshman English
course in that it supplies special aids
to students for whom English is a
strange and confusing language. While
a handbook of grammar is the basic
text, students frequently are assigned
reading in periodicals such as TIME
and NEWSWEEK so that they may
learn American idioms as well as gram-
mar. They also view films on American
life and culture and occasionally visit
a typical business firm or civic institu-
tion.
There is a great influx of foreign stu-
dents into the United States each year.
Representatives from countries all over
the world are coming to America to
fulfill their college education; many of
them to Notre Dame.
The majority of these foreign stu-
dents come from Latin America, where
they have been prepared for university
work in their mother-tongue, Spanish.
Many of the Spanish-speaking students
took English as a foreign language
while attending high school.
“English 11-X” enables the student
to use English faster, to be able to ex-
press himself better, to be able to grasp
the texts and lectures quicker and to
be able to write examinations and
papers with more ease.
The class, which meets three times
each week, is taught by Abdallah Sam-
uel Adelo, an instructor on the Notre
Dame faculty. Notre Dame awarded
a Bachelor of Arts degree to Mr. Adelo
in 1947, and recently he was admitted
to the Indiana Bar following his grad-
uation from the ND School of Law.
He has taken advanced courses at
Northwestern University and will soon
receive a Ph.D. in languages from that
institution.
Mr. Adelo is a native of Pecos, New
Mexico, (a small Spanish-speaking
community) and his bilingual back-
ground has made him the ideal choice
for teaching this special course. During
World War II he served in the U. S.
Army as an interpreter, translator and
language teacher.
Students currently enrolled in Eng-
lish 11-X are from Japan, Nationalist
China, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Peru, Costa
Rica, Puerto Rico and Guatemala.
The excellence of American engi-
neering and commerce schools is what
attracts Latin American students to
this country in Adelo’s opinion.
Another important factor, he says, is
the desire of the Latin Americans to
learn to speak English well since facility
with the English language is becoming
increasingly important south-of-the-
border. Many Latin American students
enroll at Notre Dame, “not only be-
cause it is one of the world’s leading
Catholic universities, but also because
it enjoys a solid academic reputation
here and in their own countries.”
By helping Spanish-speaking stu-
dents at Notre Dame understand lec-
tures and textbooks more readily,
“English 11-X” is helping make better
engineers, architects and businessmen
for the Latin American countries.
“They will return to their homelands
as leaders in their professions,” Adelo
states. “More importantly, they will
be well prepared for leadership in the
growing struggle with Communism and
Red infiltration in South America.”

Notre Dame
by Peter Campbell
The author is a member of the Junior
Class and is majoring in Journalism.
His home is in Elkton., Md.
Dr. Joseph. B. Crowley, infirmary physician, ‘observes’
as Mrs. Raabe administers to student.
Breakfast in bed and three pillows
under your head—is this Notre Dame?
It is if one goes to the student in-
firmary.
For a family of 5,400, Notre Dame
has been blessed with a high health-
rate. This can probably be traced to
the cleanliness of the student’s living
quarters and to the quality of the stu-
dent’s food; but nevertheless, the Uni-
versity finds it wise to maintain a large
infirmary even though it has been
filled only on rare occasions.
The infirmary, completed in 1936,
is a beautiful three-story structure on
the north side of the campus, some 400
feet behind the Administration build-
ing. Besides having a bed capacity of
93 it has many features of a regular
hospital such as a contagion section, a
student-patient dining room, a com-
plete modem dispensary, a testing lab-
oratory, a fully equipped modem
kitchen, a sun porch, living quarters
for some members of the staff and a
chapel with a seating capacity of 50.
Accommodations are in either single
or double rooms or in ten-bed wards,
each having its own lavatory facilities.
Windows are built on a slant to pre-
vent drafts and all light shields are

Full-time Doctor On Duty
Students in need of care find a com-
petent staff prepared to serve them 24
hours a day and seven days a week.
Everything from a blister on the foot
to a broken limb is treated.
The professional staff is headed by
Sister Margaret Ann, C.S.C., R.N., su-
pervisor of the Infirmary and a nurse
for the past 35 years. She served as
administrator of a 300-bed hospital in
Anderson, Indiana, for six years.
Dr. Joseph B. Crowley, a native of
Franklin, Mass., and graduate of Tufts
Medical College, is the physician on
full-time duty. Other physicians on
the staff for consultation include Dr.
Sherman L. Egan, Dr. George Green,
Dr. R. H. Denham, Jr., and Dr. Leslie
L. Bodnar.
Rev. Thomas Lahey, C.S.C., is resi-
dent chaplain at the Infirmary. Father
Lahey celebrates daily Mass in the
chapel, distributes Holy Communion
in the wards to those too sick to at-
tend Mass, and assists the students
with their various spiritual needs.
Additional members of the staff in-
clude eight registered nurses, three of
whom are Sisters of the Congregation
of Holy Cross; a practical nurse; a lab-
oratory technician; a medical stenog-
rapher; two cooks; four maids; one
janitor and a varying number of
nurse’s aids.
The infirmary has a slogan that is
becoming well known around campus:
“See us before it gets the better of
you.”
“If the student would only come to
us at the very first sign of a cold or
whatever ailment he has,” explained
Vol. 8 • No. I

Sister Margaret Ann, “we could prob-
ably save him a great deal of time and
misery. The most common troubles are
coughs, head-colds, sore throats. Of
course, we receive our share of sprains
and fractures.”
During the nine-month school year
11,000 treatments are administered
and during the relatively quiet summer
months another 1,000. The infirmary
is divided into two sections: a ward
that deals with cases requiring bed
care; and an emergency or out-patient
section that deals with cases that do
not require bed care.
Early in the semester the infirmary
gives innoculations to the ROTC units
and physical examinations to those
who wish to participate in varsity and
intramural sports. January and Feb-
ruary are usually the busiest months
with 80 to 90 cases a day. This situa-
tion changes, however, depending
mostly upon the weather. This year,
for example, because of the extremely
wet weather during home football
games, there was a great deal of minor
sicknesses during October and No-
vember.
In its recent history, the infirmary
has been filled to capacity only once,
that was in February of 1952 when a
flu epidemic hit the South Bend area.
Statistics show that four out of five
students go through each year con-
tracting little more than a mild cold;
and those who are confined spend an
average of only three to four days
in bed.
In special cases that require elab-
orate equipment or the attention of a
number of doctors, the student is trans-
ferred to Saint Joseph’s hospital, one
and a half miles from the University.
It is also under the direction of the
Congregation of Holy Cross Sisters.
Rules of the infirmary are few and
simple, but they are enforced. Besides
the usual hospital regulations the in-
firmary does not permit radios to be
played after 10 p.m., nor are visitors
allowed above the first floor. Of course,
exceptions are made for relatives of
patients.
This is one place on campus where
a fellow is treated like a king. He is
under excellent medical care and soon
The Infirmary is an important factor
in the student health program.
Sister Margaret Ann, C.S.C., (center) is supervisor of the Infirmary. Sister Aurelius, C.S.C.,
and Mrs. Bott are members of the staff which includes a total of eight registered nurses.

STUDENT HEALTH PLAN
The Notre Dame Student Health
Insurance Plan, approved by the
University and administered by the
Continental Casualty Co., Chicago,
ill., has more than 1300 students
enrolled during the present school-
year. The cost is $21 for the full
12 months and includes benefits
from sickness and accident. The
campus office is located in the
LaFortune Student Center.
discovers that “T L C” is a main part
of his diet. As Mrs. Bott., nurse of the
second floor says, “The boys range
from the age of 17 to 23, but never-
theless, when they’re sick they like
motherly attention. We try to give it
to them and they call it T L C—
tender loving care. I think they ap-
preciate it.”
This year the infirmary introduced
the new policy of seeing that if pos-
sible the student is served whatever he
desires. “When boys are well they can
eat almost anything,” explains Sister
M. Aurelius, “but when they are sick
they have to be coaxed by good food
and by the type that they like.”
Students approve of this idea whole-
heartedly. “The food is great,” says
Tom Camp of Chicago, “so good that
you hate to admit that you’re getting
better and will have to give up this
luxury.” Bob Hutch of Westmoreland
Hills, Maryland, puts it this way:
“This is really the life; we get plenty
of sleep, food and have fun, and be-
lieve it or not—a bed-time snack. Last
night we had milkshakes and dough-
nuts before turning out the lights.”
Except in cases of contagious dis-
eases or very serious illness, all the stu-
dents are ward patients. This helps
make their stay more pleasant for they
can talk, play cards or help each other
with their studies. Usually the student
doesn’t even fall behind in his school
work.
Even though visitors are not allowed
into the wards the patient is still in
contact with the “outside world.”
Members of the Third Order of Saint
Francis circulate through the wards
daily and bring whatever the student
needs, such as his mail, his books, a
pack of cigarettes or what have you.
Although this is the only place on
campus that one is served breakfast in
bed, it still isn’t a popular hangout.
Who wants to be sick? However, when
you are, you couldn’t ask for a better
place.

Holy Communion to students who are sick and unable to attend daily Mass.

air flow around wing surfaces and on jet engines.
Aero Engineering
Research at Notre Dame
May Provide Important
Data for Leadership
in Jet Aviation
by Pat Brennan
’	The author is majoring in Journa-
,	lism and formerly was a staff writer for
;	the Denver Catholic Register. He is
j	married, has two children and his
'	home is in Denver, Colo.
The University of Notre Dame has
made another unprecedented contribu-
tion to man’s scientific progress.
Notre Dame engineers’ original de-
velopments in smoke tunnel experimen-
tation, which have enabled scientists
literally to SEE the wind blow, may
18 Notre Dame
prove to be a boon to jet aviation
throughout the world.
F. N. M. Brown, head of Notre
Dame’s aeronautical engineering de-
partment, and Prof. Robert Eikenberry,
on the university’s faculty for 17 years,
have become the first to apply the use
of three-dimensional photography to a
smoke tunnel. They are, in effect, the
first to make the smoke tunnel—con-
ceived by Marey in 1901 and “long
tried” by scientists—actually useful in
the fundamental study of air flow.
Brown in 1940 constructed at Notre
Dame the world’s first “useful” three-
dimensional smoke tunnel, which could
maintain “nearly zero turbulence up
to 35 feet per second.” The university
now has a tunnel that can maintain
a near-zero turbulence at 185 feet per
second and this tunnel is still the only
one in existence to have passed the “20
feet per second mark.”
Eikenberry was the first to adapt the
stereo-comparator—a device used to-
day mainly for aerial mapping — to
“very short distance photography” for
use in smoke tunnel experimentation.
Prior to the Brown-Eikenberry devel-
opments, experimentalists working with
the old-type wind tunnel could only
determine the average force of air on
an object, could ascertain only the
average pressure over the surface of a
model, and the direction of the velocity
was unknown to them.
“Now we not only can photograph
a three-dimensional air pattern,” noted
Brown, “but we can measure it with
a stereo-comparator.”
What does this mean?
“We cannot see the air flow,” con-
tinued Brown, “but since we can
photograph it the motion can be
stopped for leisurely examination and
measurement. Heretofore this was im-
possible. The net result could be a
general improvement in the jet
engine through the improvement of
the turbine and the compressor
blades.”
Making use of their unique three-
dimensional smoke tunnel photography,
Brown and Eikenberry, whose findings
have already helped to solve “wing
flutter trouble” on the Boeing B-52.
have worked on sub-sonic diffusers for
turbo-jet engines and are now studying
the air flow around turbine blades for
jet engines. Their discoveries have

A double-exposure picture was used by the above group to photo-
graph clearly the air flow in the smoke chamber and at the same
time to observe the participants gathered around the tunnel.
Professor Robert Eikenberry is using his stereo comparator in a
study of air flow. He has been a member of the Notre Dame
faculty since 1938 and is a licensed pilot.

made it possible for aeronautical engi-
neers to “know what’s going on”
around these turbine blades. “This
knowledge,” points out Brown, “may
help solve a ‘surge’ problem that has
the effect of robbing the jet’s engine of
air, a phenomenon which causes the
jet’s flame to go out and may result
in a forced landing. The ‘surge’ prob-
lem, however, is mainly one of uneven
operation. The serious difficulty occurs
on acceleration from low speeds and
deceleration from high speeds. Our
original developments here at Notre
Dame may lead to a solution of the
problem.”
The Brown-Eikenberry experiments
have attracted global attention.
Through the Smithsonian Institution,
pictures resulting from smoke-tunnel
experimentation at Notre Dame this
past summer were shown throughout
Europe. The Encyclopedia Brittanica
will include examples of Brown’s work
in a future edition (probably 1956).
This work at Notre Dame is the first
U. S. experimentation in the field even
to merit a mention by the editors of
Brittanica.
Brown, a Protestant who came to
Notre Dame in 1935, credits the uni-
versity heavily for his achievements.
“I think the fact that the university has
backed me to the hilt on every phase
of experimentation has contributed
much to the success of my original
smoke tunnel experimentation,” he
said. “Every university is now build-
ing, or will build, a smoke tunnel. Our
work was all a matter of development
rather than invention and a great
illuminator of stupidity.”
In addition to his smoke tunnel de-
velopment, Brown has two other
“firsts” to his credit. His “Photo-
graphic Space-Time Recorder,” which
appeared in 1938, makes it possible
for experts to determine how much
force is applied in the landing process
to the wheels of any particular air-
craft. This calculation of “accelera-
tion and loads” is obtained when
Brown’s invention records photograph-
ically the motion of an object in space
against time.
The “Brown Navigator,” developed
in 1941, is a small plotting board which
enables the student navigators to work
a problem in flight, record the results,
and save them for further study.

"push button"
Plant Growth Research
By Electronic Devices
Experimentation in plant growth via
the ‘push button’ method is a new and
important feature of Notre Dame’s
Department of Biology. Two rooms are
equipped to recreate many environ-
mental conditions occurring through-
out the world by electronic devices
which control temperature, relative
humidity, and lighting. Each of these
chambers has an air conditioner with
the refrigerating capacity of five tons
of air. Biologists now can trace the
fluctuation of cell growth through the
study of plant life.
For example: research is being con-
ducted, presently, on colchicine, a
chemical that affects the chromosomes
in a plant and in turn affects the size
and production of the plant.
A singular development in the field
of horticultural genetics made by a
University of Notre Dame biologist and
now in the process of being patented
may within five years make possible a
college education here for many de-
serving young men of inadequate finan-
cial means.
Utilizing Notre Dame’s ultra-modem
$12,500 “growth rooms,” by which ex-
perimenters can maintain “absolute
control” over environmental factors
affecting plant life, Dr. Albert Delisle,
an associate professor at the univer-
sity, has produced the world’s first
“synthesized aster hybrid derived from
‘five-chromosome’ parents. Actually,
parents each have five pairs of chromo-
somes. Amazingly, what Delisle initi-
ated as a pure scientific endeavor has
de facto blossomed into a discovery
replete with commercial possibilities,
for, to the florist industry, his hybrid
means a “more beautiful, more
sturdy,” and, perhaps, a more econom-
ical commodity which would be avail-
able in floral shops and markets every-
where.
Complementing his ingenuity with
generosity, Delisle, realizing the money-
making potential of his findings, imme-
diately assigned the patent to the uni-
versity “in the hope that a trust fund
might be established to create scholar-
ships for needy students without re-
gard for specific curricula.”
Delisle—the first biologist to dis-
cover that the basic number of

The Irish Greenhouse
A prime requisite of the Univer-
sity’s graduate program in botany is
the Notre Dame biology depart-
ment’s $12,500 green house. It was
completed in 1951, and is the cul-
mination of plans initiated in 1945.
There are four sections with auto-
matic controls for temperature and
light, which is making possible grad-
uate work leading toward doctorate
and master’s degrees in botany. It
has also contributed to research at
the university. Equipped with a
central “potting” room, the green
house—begun after a study of latest
facilities at other universities—is
91 feet long and 25 feet wide.
chromosomes in the aster was five
pairs, not nine pairs as previously be-
lieved—on Nov. 1, 1954, received a
$5,000 National Science Foundation
grant from the U. S. government. This
will further his research at Notre
Dame. The botanist’s significant dis-
coveries in the field of horticultural
genetics were made possible by the
constant encouragement and co-opera-
tion of the university.
“The construction in 1953 of the
new growth rooms and an excellent re-
search green house are but two of many
examples of how Notre Dame is striv-
ing to maintain its superiority in scien-
tific development,” notes Delisle.
The scientist earned his undergrad-
uate degree at the University of Mas-
sachusetts, Amherst. Mass., in 1932,
and he received a master’s (1933) and
a doctorate (1937) at Harvard. It
was at Harvard that Delisle, together
with K. V. Thimann, world-renowned
biologist, scored another “first.” De-
lisle and Thimann, among the first to
root white pine cuttings were the first
to discover an “age effect” on the
rooting ability of cuttings (branch
specimens) taken from trees of vari-
ous ages. They were among the first
to show that cuttings from young trees
will root readily whereas those of older
trees will not. Prior to these experi-
ments horticulturists had thought it
impossible to propagate white pine
cuttings.
On the faculty of the College of
William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va.,
from 1940 to 1943, Delisle came to
Notre Dame in 1947. Besides the more
outstanding results of their efforts,
Ultra-modern greenhouse cost $12,500 and was built in 1951.

Delisle and Notre Dame, working as a
team, have greatly added to science’s
fund of knowledge in the field of aster
genetics.
Delisle’s contributions to scientific
progress and his fine efforts to help
needy boys gain a college education
seem to be “natural,” rather than sen-
sational or unusual. It‘is the product
of an educational system such as that
of Notre Dame—an educational system
that looks upon the material objects of
scientific research as the “things that
God has made.”
