FARRUG
Co. Fund
BY KENNETH F. MURPHY
Dearborn Notre Dame alumni assisted the Ford Scholars in
organizing a campus club.
Alumni officers Richard King (1.), vice-pres., P. J. Kernan, Jr., pres., are Ford employees.
The author, a Senior in the College
of Arts and Letters, has previously

LaLONDE
Grant of $500 Given to Notre Dame for Each
Scholarship Recipient by Ford Motor
Bob Nouhan is a soft-spoken, dark-
complexioned lad with a brush of
black hair. He’s not much different
from most young men in America his
age—played basketball and baseball in
high school, likes fried chicken and
pumpkin pie, and has an older brother
with the Signal Corps in Alaska.
Bob’s home is in Detroit, where his
dad works for Ford Motor Company
as an inspector of crankshafts for trac-
tors. He has been with Ford about 12
years now. Bob wanted to go to col-
lege, but he didn’t think there was
much chance of ever getting there be-
cause of the financial burden which
faces so many others of college age.
Today Bob Nouhan is a sophomore
at the University of Notre Dame
School of Architecture. He is one of
seventy 1952 Ford scholarship winners
from 57 high schools in 14 states now
attending the college of their choice
2
Notre Dame
and one of 11 young men at Notre
Dame on this plan.
The student at Notre Dame pays
only about 70% of what it actually
costs for his education—the remaining
30% comes from the University, in the
form of contributions received from
alumni and other friends. Realizing
this plight the Ford Motor Company
Fund donates an annual $500 grant to
each college or university where the
scholarship holder is in attendance.
The Ford Fund is an entirely non-
profit corporation organized for educa-
tional, scientific and charitable pur-
poses. It is supported principally by
contributions from the Ford Motor
Company.
The Ford Motor Company Fund
Scholarship Program was originated in
1951 for sons and daughters of Ford
employees. It is intended for “those
whose academic records and personal
qualifications indicate to the Scholar-
ship Board that they will benefit from
college education and will develop
into well-rounded adults, capable of
constructive work and responsible
citizenship.”
A scholarship winner who maintains
satisfactory personal and scholastic
standards will keep his scholarship
throughout the normal four years of
college attendance, and the scholarship
will not be interrupted because a par-
ent ceases to be an employee of Ford
Motor Company. Moreover, any win-
ner whose education is interrupted by
military service may, upon receipt of
an honorable discharge, apply for re-
instatement of the scholarship.
The Program is conducted competi-
tively, and winners of approximately
70 scholarships are picked each year.
The competition is open, specifically,
to anyone whose father or mother is
in the employ of the Ford Motor Com-
pany and is earning a base pay of less
than $763 per month. Children of em-
ployees who have either died or re-
tired are also eligible to compete.
The fourth year of competition
comes up with 74 colleges and univer-
sities in 27 states already numbering
Ford scholars in their enrollments.
The young men and women who
win may select any approved college or
university in the United States. The
scholarship award covers tuition fee
and approximately 80% of living
costs, which of course vary, depending
on whether the student lives at home
while attending college or is in resi-

He is currentlv associate editor of the
yearbook and was recently elected
president of the newly-organized Ford
Scholars of Notre Dame campus club.
The club was originated with a view
toward better social relationships
among the various Ford scholars on
campus, and hopes to contact scholar-
ship winners at other schools in the
near future. Bud’s dad is a stock
analyst for Ford and has been with
the company for 27 years.
Brown, secretary-treasurer of the
new Ford campus club, is in pre-med.
He maintained the highest average in
his class during freshman year, and
was second high last year by a meager
3/10 point. His dad is a Ford dealer

versity, who were among the 74 win-
ners out of some 420 applicants in the
spring of 1953, are Michael Farrug,

“... J shall leave some whisper of a song in these old oaks. ”
Now and then I seek a moment out of time to stroll
along the edges of our campus. It is always pleasant along
these country paths. It is always good to smell the fresh
spring land., to taste the rain-washed air. With my Breviary
under my arm, I hurry away.
As I read the Divine Office, strange thoughts edge
through the psalms. Out of the past and into the present
comes the wisdom of the wise. Out of the past comes the
meaning of the present. Frequently, I stop in the reading of
these wonderful prayers. Distractions have a thousand
heads, two thousand arms, a million kicking feet. May the
Good Lord forgive us for so many interruptions in His
service. Even university presidents must fight distractions.
Walking to the West, I follow a path that stretches
between the Community House and Holy Cross Seminary.
Some of the boys from the Seminary are out hitting base-
balls. The crack of the bat and the shouts echo memories
from the past and make me feel older than I am.
Along the way and off to the right on the banks of Saint
Joseph’s Lake is the gaunt yellow brick of Moreau Seminary.
In this building the scholastics live. These are the young
men who have finished their novitiate and are now doing
college studies. They are a wonderful group, and we are
proud of them. We are proud of the great work they do in
their years of preparation for the priesthood. We look to
them as they look to us and together we look to the future.
Off to the distance across the western sky is a picture of
America on the move. The busy Dixie Highway is fast with
trucks and cars. I turn my eyes from the busy road. I see too
much of speed too much of hurry.
Unlike Kilmer, along the road to Suffern, I do not pass
a poor old farmhouse with shingles broken and black. My
half-way house, my stopping place, where I can read my
prayers in peace, where the psalms surprise me with their
music, is our cemetery. Here, in a few acres of earth, are
the mortal remains of the Holy Cross men who lived and
worked to build Notre Dame. Here, as in Flanders Field,
the crosses stretch row on row. Here, as in heaven, the
names upon these crosses are a history of hearts.
It hurts beyond the power of words to tell. I see the
names of men whose lives are so much a part of me. I close
my eyes and I see them wearing their blessed black cassocks.
I listen and I hear again a melody of voices, a symphony of
songs. They are a choir of creatures who sang their .song
of life for all the world to witness. They sought no praise for
themselves. In Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience they lived
their dedicated lives. The story of Notre Dame, if it can
ever be told, must find its telling, to a large extent, in the
silence of these crosses.
Somewhere in this small but hallowed ground is a place
for me and for all our priests and Brothers. The day will
come when we, the living, must join our dead. The future
of Holy Cross, the future of Notre Dame, looks to you who
love and appreciate the work we do. We need men to fill
the future, to serve Our Lady at Her school.
I say no more. I have my Breviary to read; I shall offer
a prayer for our dear dead who served so well the days of
the past. I shall offer a prayer for you, our friends, who are
part of our present and our future. I ask you, please, never
to forget us. Pray that the Lord will send us boys and men
to fill the ranks of Holy Cross. We need Lay Brothers to
work in our shops, oui’ offices, and the grounds. We need
priests to carry on our work of teaching and the administra-
tive offices. We need these vocations to link the future with
the present and the present with the past.
This is Notre Dame—the past, the present, and the
future. The sun is warm and through the trees it dances
little shadows on the tiny crosses. I open my Breviary and
recall the words of one of our own priest poets, "... I shall
leave some whisper of a song in these old oaks.”

Causes of Tooth Decay
Reported by LOBUND
Research scientists at Notre Dame’s
LOBUND Institute have established
the first direct proof that micro-organ-
isms in the mouth are necessary for
tooth decay.	Using germ-free rats
7	O O
available only at Notre Dame as a re-
sult of two decades of pioneering re-
search, scientists have demonstrated
conclusively that even a rich, cario-
genic diet will not produce tooth decay
designed and built by Notre Dame scientists under the
unless germs are also present in the
mouth. Their findings were reported
recently at the annual meeting of the
^American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science in Boston.
The next phase of the long-range
research project will be an attempt to
determine which of the many organ-
isms normally found in the mouth ac-
tually cause tooth decay, according to
Professor James A. Reyniers, founder
and director of the LOBUND Insti-
tute. The project is a collaborative
effort financed by the University of
Notre Dame, the Office of Naval Re-
search and the Zoller Memorial Den-
tal Clinic of the University of Chicago.
Tooth decay, the most widespread
ailment of man, has been attributed
to a variety of causes including nutri-
tional and hereditary factors. On the
other hand, many scientists believed
that tooth decay was due to germ ac-
tion in the mouth which produces acid
which in turn disintegrates the tooth
enamel causing the process called de-
cay. Notre Dame scientists including
Professors Philip Trexler, Morris Wag-
ner, Thomas Luckey and Helmut Gor-
don set out to substantiate this latter
theory.
The exact relationship between
mouth bacteria and tooth decay had
never been determined previously be-
cause dental research scientists did not
have a proper animal with which to
experiment. In the mouth of the hu-
man being or the ordinary experimen-
tal animal there are dozens of kinds
of germs which change from meal to
meal, diet to diet, and from day to
day. Billions of these germs normally
exist in the mouth.
But in recent years Notre Dame
scientists have developed a unique tool
in tooth decay research. As
special apparatus which was
direction of Prof. Reyniers.
Decay in the molar teeth of an ordinary
germ-laden rat fed a decay producing diet.
Undecayed molar teeth of a germ-free rat
fed the same diet. Ordinary rats when fed an
identical sterilized diet, develop more than
99% tooth decay in 150 days. Photo (op-
posite page) of germ-free rat used in the

for bacteriological and medical re-
search, the germ-free animal. Genera-
tions of these animals have been born
and live in a germ-free state in ap-
paratus designed and built by LO-
BUND scientists. It was to these living
test-tubes that the scientists turned to
seek the cause of tooth decay.
They developed a diet which when
sterilized by steam under pressure and
fed to ordinary germ-laden rats caused
more than 99% tooth decay within
150 days. When the identical sterilized
diet was fed to germ-free rats, not even
a microscopic trace of tooth decay was
found. This, the scientists feel, indi-
cates strongly that a germ or combina-
tion of germs in the mouth are neces-
sary to produce tooth decay.
Seek Prevention of Tooth Decay
In this collaborative project, the
germ-free research phases were carried
on by LOBUND scientists at Notre
Dame while the dental evaluation was
made by Dr. J. Roy Blayney and Dr.
Frank Orland of the Zoller Clinic.
As the second phase of the research
gets underway, it is hoped that the
exact organism or organisms respon-
sible for tooth decay can be identified.
When the specific cause of tooth decay
has been found, scientists will be in a
better position to seek an agent which
will prevent the disease.
But tooth decay research is only one
phase of the work of Notre Dame’s
LOBUND Institute. Other important
areas of research include radiation
sickness, antibiotics and growth, liver
necrosis, protein metabolism, and the
role of intestinal bacteria in nutrition.
The work of the Institute is supported
by the University of Notre Dame, the
Office of Naval Research, the Atomic
Energy Commission, the U. S. Army
Medical Corps, the National Institutes
of Health, the Damon Runyon Fund
and private corporations.
With a Modern Accent
The LaFortune Student Center Is Functional and
Fashionable
The LaFortune Student Center' with beautiful, spacious
lounges; club and refreshment rooms: and various other
facilities has played an important part in student activities
during the current school-year. Scenes of the building’s
interior, shown on these pages, pictorially describe a mod-
ernistic, functional structure. The main lobby is accented
with indirect lighting and features a “Little Theatre” with
seating capacity for 80 people. A series of dances and
mixers for students have been held since the Center was
officially opened last Fall. Music can be piped throughout
the building from a control room located on the second
floor. Offices of the Student Senate and the Rev. James
E. Norton, C.S.C., vice-president in charge of student
affairs, are located in the Center.
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph A. LaFortune’s gift of $135,000
to the University greatly aided in underwriting the con-
struction costs for the Student Center. The donors live
in Tulsa, Oklahoma Mr. LaFortune is a member of the
Associate Board of Lay Trustees at Notre Dame, Vice-
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Warren Petroleum
Co., and a member of the 1916 class. He received an hon-
orary degree from the University in 1949.
The furnishing and decoration of the building were
supervised by the Women’s Advisory Council led by Mrs.
E. M. Morris of South Bend, Ind. Special gifts included a
bequest from the late Lt. Elmore Smith, a 1951 Notre
Dame graduate killed in Korea. Mrs. George W. Strake.
Houston, Tex., and Mrs. O. J. Caron, Rochelle, Ill., helped
to underwrite the project.

A (CAPSULE) REPORT OF ALUMNI AND NON- UMI
The beginning of the Notre Dame
Foundation in 1947 marked a sig-
nificant step forward in obtaining
financial aid for the University.
Contributions since that time have
been generously given by alumni
and non-alumni friends. There have
been peak periods in which capital
gifts and the Fisher art collection
were recorded. Six new buildings
totaling $7,000,000 have been erect-
ed. Donations from corporations
and individuals, in 1953-54, will be
allocated to the Distinguished Pro-
fessors Program and the Faculty De-
velopment Fund.

Notre Dame accepts resignation of Frank Leahy—
and signs 25-year-old Terry Brennan as successor
Frank Leahy, the most successful football coach of his
era, resigned from the University of Notre Dame on Jan-
uary 31 because of ill health. He was succeeded by 25-
year-old Terry Brennan, freshman coach and former Irish
backfield star.

been written about the fabulous career of Coach Leahy
and NOTRE DAME does not plan to repeat in full what
is already history and common knowledge with the major-
ity of Fighting Irish followers. The portrayal on these
pages will tend to highlight in words and pictures outstand-
ing features concerning Coach Leahy and Coach Brennan.
Leahy’s remarkable coaching ability was demonstrated
not only at Notre Dame but also included Boston College.
Fordham, Georgetown, and Michigan State. His Boston
eleven lost only two games in that many seasons and went
through undefeated one year. While at Fordham as an
assistant coach, Frank tutored the famous ‘Seven Blocks
of Granite.’ He was head coach on two occasions of the
College All-Star squad in their traditional Summer con-
test with the professional champions. Notre Dame under
Frank Leahy compiled one of the longest undefeated
streaks in college football when his 1946. 1947. 1948 and
1949 teams were unbeaten although tied twice in that
period. The undefeated skein lasted through 37 games.
Frank distinguished himself off the football field as
much as on it. He was in great demand as a public
speaker and his family life was exemplary to the highest
degree. Notre Dame players were encouraged to be good-
will ambassadors for the University and their public con-
duct on trips away from home brought many laudatory
comments from alumni and other friends.

Terry Brennan is probably best remembered as the
fleet-footed halfback who raced 97 yards on the opening
kickoff against Army in 1947—the last time the two teams
met—and scored six points which had much to do with
Notre Dame attaining a great victory'. At Mt. Carmel
High School, Chicago. Ill.. Terry achieved one of the
best prep coaching records in the nation when his teams
won three city championships in four years. And this is
against what is undoubtedly the toughest high school
league anywhere.
Rockne was 29 years old when he took over the head
job at N.D., while Leahy was 32 when he returned to the
campus in 1941. Terry Brennan is also a capable speaker
and possesses a law degree from DePaul University in
addition to having been a philosophy major at Notre
Dame. He was an instructor in Business Law besides
being Freshman Coach.
Coach Brennan last year was selected by the Chicago
Junior Chamber of Commerce and Industry as "one of
the six outstanding young men of the year.” He was the
youngest of the group to be chosen.
The varsity staff under Brennan will consist of Bill
Earley and Johnny Druze, backfield and end mentors
(both holdovers from the Leahy organization); Bill
Fischer, formerly with the Chicago Cardinals professional
football team and Brennan’s teammate at N.D., as line
coach, and George Dickson, former Irish quarterback, who
aided Hughie Devore at NYU, as backfield assistant.
Frank Leahy hasn’t made a public announcement, as
this publication goes to press, regarding his future plans.

Father Hesburgh stated, when Frank resigned, that ‘*we
are grateful for his devoted years of service and will cher-
ish a continuing association with him through the Notre
Dame Foundation which he has volunteered to serve.”

Engineer for Standard Oil Development Co., Linden, N. J. Jim will graduate in June.
Jim Harrington shatters the popu-
lar belief that a college athlete is a
young man of strong back but weak
mind. Last year he vaulted higher
indoors than any other collegiate pole
vaulter in the nation and was the top
student in his Chemical Engineering
class.
As a chemical engineering student,
Jim has made his way through three
and one-half years of one of the rough-
est courses at Notre Dame—only twen-
ty are left of his original class of eighty.
He grapples with such courses as Ther-
modynamics, Quantitative and Quali-
tative Analysis, Organic Chemical
Technology, and spends three after-
noons a week in laboratory work. Yet
his academic average of 94 ranks him
first among the senior chemical en-
gineers and seventh in the entire senior
class at Notre Dame.
You would think that a schedule of
eighteen hours of class and twelve
hours of lab per week plus the time
each day he spends in his pole vault
workouts leaves little room for any-
thing but vaulting and studying. But
Harrington still finds time for extra-
curricular activities. He is co-editor
of the Technical Recieu.', a quarterly
magazine published by the College of
Engineering. He won second prize last
year- in the Leland V. Stanford Essay
Contest with his literary effort on
“Liberal Education in Relation to
Technical Education.” This year he
won first prize in the same contest. He
has a seat on the Engineering Advisory
Board and is a member of the Gym-
nastic Club and the Monogram Club.
He is also chairman of the Midwestern
District Convention of the Student
Chapters of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers, to be held at
Notre Dame in May, 1954.
Harrington’s participation in other
campus activities and organizations
prove that his interests extend beyond
engineering and athletics. As a fresh-
man he competed in the annual Breen
oratorical contest and went as far as
the finals. For two years he served as
a news reporter on the Notre Dame
Scholastic, student news weekly. He is
a member of the Speakers’ Bureau and
is also one of the more articulate mem-
bers of the Bookmen, a literary dis-
cussion club.
Jim has followed in the athletic and
scholastic footsteps of his father, like-
wise a pole vaulter and a chemical en-
gineei' at Notre Dame. In 1925 Paul
J. Harrington won the pole vault event
at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia. A
year later as captain of the track team
he raised the Notre Dame indoor vault
record from 12’5” to 12’9%”- and in
a meet at the University of Illinois
soared 13’1^” for a new world indoor
record. The record was broken several
hours later when Charlie Hoff of Nor-
way went almost two inches higher in
a meet held in New York. Before his
vaulting days at Notre Dame were
over the elder Harrington owned both
the indoor and outdoor records. The
year after he graduated he won an
award for the outstanding athlete in
the Millrose games.
Though he was ineligible for inter-
collegiate competition as a freshman
at Notre Dame, Jim upped his per-
sonal record to 13 feet. Since then in
31 meets from Philadelphia to Texas
he has collected a total of 20 first
places and it takes an off day to make
him finish lower than third. In 1952
under the unusual circumstances of
having to vault indoors in an outdoor
meet—the new vaulting pit on Cartier
Field was not yet finished—Jim set a
Notre Dame record of 13’9^8”. And
in March 1953 at the Central Colle-
giate Championships in the Notre
Dame Fieldhouse Jim broke his pre-
vious record and achieved his greatest
thrill with a vault of 14’3^”.
What will he do in 1954? He’s aim-
ing for the pole vaulter’s dream of
fifteen feet and judging from his first
practice vault this season of 13’8” the
odds are not great against him.
As a left-handed pole vaulter Jim
Harrington is unusual among the boys
who swing up and over the bar. But
regardless of whether or not Jim Har-
rington establishes additional athletic
achievements he is one of Notre Dame’s
outstanding students.
