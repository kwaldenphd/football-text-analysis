NOTRE DAME RECEIVES <2,630.300
FROM THE FORD FOUNDATION
Announcement of the Ford Foundation’s tre-
mendous gift of a half-billion dollars to the nation’s
privately supported universities., colleges and hos-
pitals was received with great enthusiasm at the
University of Notre Dame when it was learned that
$2,630,300 would be given for the Faculty Develop-
ment Program. The total of $500,000,000 is by far
the largest amount contributed by any foundation
for a single program in all history.
Six hundred and fifteen colleges and universities
will benefit from $210,000,000 while 3,500 privately
operated hospitals and medical schools will get
$290,000,000. The amount of each college grant
was determined by the approximate matching of
the institution’s 1954-55 payroll for instruction pur-
poses. A special “bonus gift” was allocated to Notre
Dame for having been a leader in Faculty Develop-
ment. For the past two years, Notre Dame has been
appealing to alumni, corporations and non-alumni
friends of the University for financial support to
increase faculty salaries.
The grant has been restricted by the Ford
Foundation over a ten-year period inasmuch as the
educational institution is allowed to use only the
interest on the invested capital. After the ten-year
period expires, the institution is permitted to use
the capital for any academic need it desires. At an
investment rate of four per cent, Notre Dame would
benefit about $105,212 annually during the next
decade for increased faculty salaries.
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., Univer-
sity president, stated: “It is difficult, if not impos-
sible, to express adequate gratitude to Mr. Henry
Ford, II, and the Trustees of the Ford Foundation
for their spectacular decision to strengthen private
higher education at the critical focal point of its vi-
tality—the faculty. Never before has generosity of
this magnitude been directed at the heart of our pri-
vate colleges and universities. Nor has wisdom so
broad of scope been heretofore so pointedly and uni-
versally applied to those who serve with the least'
financial reward of all professions. Faculty members
have been heartened and private educators every-
where have had their hopes revitalized by this mag-
nificent grant of the Ford Foundation.
“This dramatic action signalizes anew the mu-
tuality of interest that exists in America between
industry and education. Here is one more magnifi-
cent chapter in the greatest social phenomena of
our age . . . wherein corporate industry manifests
an enlightened and responsible leadership to keep
alive and growing those private educational endeav-
ors that have at great sacrifice provided America
with trained and competent manpower.
“The University of Notre Dame is deeply
grateful for the vote of confidence and the help re-
ceived.”
HIGHLIGHTS
★	Grants to all schools are to be invested and only the annual income
can be applied to faculty salaries for the next ten years.
★	If N. D. gets a yield of four per cent on its invested $2,630,300, the
University will receive $105,212 annually during the next decade
for faculty development.
★	After a ten-year period, the capital investment may be used for any
academic need.
★	Notre Dame received $2,630,300 for faculty development.
★	Payment of the grant to Notre Dame and other schools will be spread
over an 18-month period, ending June of 1957, and benefit of the full
annual income will not be until June of 1958.
★	In Roman Catholic Institutions, where priests and nuns are unpaid,
the money may go to lay teachers or to improve the professional
competence of the clerical teachers.
★	Since the capital gift of $2,630,300 will be restricted on the basis of
investment returns to faculty development for the next decade, it
will not alter Notre Dame’s already planned 10-year program, begun
in 1947, which still lists the following needs:
Two Student Residence Halls Administration Building
Dining Hall	General Operating Funds
Library	Endowment Funds
Auditorium	Priests’ Residence
Fieldhouse	Special Funds: (new books, learned
Graduate Student Hall	publications, teachers retirement,
Maintenance Center	non-faculty retirement)
★	Total amount given to private colleges, universities and hospitals
equals $500 million.
★	There are about 7,000 foundations in the United States and the Ford
Foundation is by far the largest. Established in 1936, financial experts
estimate the Ford Foundation’s holdings to be at least $2,500,000,000.
A total of $210,000,000 will be given to 615 colleges and univer-
sities for faculty development.
★	Notre Dame ranked tenth in amount received by colleges and univer-
sities according to published reports.
★	Undoubtedly, the Ford Foundation grant will serve as an important
effort to stimulate alumni (the other 50 per cent at Notre Dame)
and friends to contribute to the University’s over-all support.
★	This was the largest single gift ever received by Notre Dame.
★	Notre Dame received the largest amount given to any Catholic
institution.
★	Unrestricted gifts from alumni and non-alumni friends, in 1955,
totaled $513,755 for Notre Dame’s Faculty Development Program.

Notre Dame
In behalf of the Administration, the Faculty and the
Student Body I extend prayerful gratitude to all of those
who have generously supported Notre Dame during the past
year. Benefactions from loyal alumni, devoted friends who
did not attend the University, and from corporations and
foundations willing to assist in the education of the nation’s
youth, reflect great interest in the University of Notre
Dame’s academic program.
The 1955 report of the Notre Dame Foundation totaling
$2,286,101, marks another milestone in the progress of our
University. May I suggest that you take a few minutes to
read it in this issue of Notre Dame.
Recently I have been asked by alumni and other friends
about future plans at Notre Dame. Will post-war expansion
continue, will the enrollment figure skyrocket to unprece-
dented heights? Has there been any major change in the
Scholarship Program? Will the Distinguished Professors
Program remain as a part of Faculty Development?
Since 1946, the erection of 12 urgently needed new
buildings has totaled $10,000,000. Primarily, these structures
were required for the influx of students following World
War II. But even additional facilities were still inadequate
to house the entire student population, after a phenomenal
increase of 40% from 1941. The number of applicants in
the immediate post-war years, largely returning GI’s, far ex-
ceeded our expectations and Notre Dame adjusted to the
situation as best it could.
Our most pressing problem is to build two more resi-
dences and provide dining space for 600 undergraduate stu-
dents now living off-campus. The approximate cost would
be $4,000,000. One of the University’s hoped-for goals is
the on-campus residence of all students except those in the
Law and Graduate Schools. In their respective categories,
these new halls should provide us with adequate residence
and academic buildings for years to come.
Of course, there are other new buildings needed as listed
in Notre Dame’s long-range development program which in-
cludes a library, graduate students’ residence, maintenance
center, priests’ residence, administration building and audi-
torium-fieldhouse.
Notre Dame intends to stabilize its enrollment to about
4,800 undergraduates. Since almost this many high school
graduates apply for admission each year, there will be many
problems involved in selecting the best qualified students.
We will probably need more alumni help in selecting the
best all-around candidates from those who qualify academic-
ally on the basis of the College Board Entrance Examinations.
Any further enrollment increase will be only in the Law
School, rising from 200 to 300, and in the Graduate School
from 400 to 750.
The Scholarship Program that now amounts to $500,000
annually, assures Notre Dame of student representation on
all economic levels. xApproximately 700 to 1000 students
benefit from the aid of scholarships each year. Grants range
from $250 for the academic year to the top subsidy of $1,500.
The University has been especially fortunate in attract-
ing scholarship grants from prominent corporations. At the
present time, there are 19 young men at Notre Dame on
Ford Foundation Scholarships and 16 from the General Mo-
tors Corporation. Since the student actually defrays only
about 70% of his educational costs, the remaining 30%
being borne by the University, both the Ford and General
Motors Scholarships offer a matching grant to Notre Dame
on an unrestricted basis. Other corporation scholarships are
being established in this same manner.
These scholarships and grants from corporations and
private foundations are particularly helpful since there has
been an annual budget increase of $1,000,000 at Notre
Dame for the past several years. It is encouraging that our
alumni this year gave $525,350 and 52.5% participated for
an all-time high in the number contributing.
The Faculty Development Program continues to pro-
gress with marked success. Corporations have underwritten
the addition of distinguished professors to our teaching staff.
About 20 permanent and temporary distinguished professors
have been at work on the campus during the past two years.
The magnificent gift from the Ford Foundation of $2,630,300
also will be of valuable assistance in improving faculty salaries.
Our benefactors have contributed a large share towards
the high, academic prestige which Notre Dame now enjoys.
The Administration hopes that even greater achievements
will materialize
during the year 1956.

... everything

Student Affairs Under Capable Direction
of Rev. James E. Norton, C.S.C., Vice-Pres.
More than studies make the stu-
dent. He may be in class 15 to
20 hours a week, at his books theoret-
ically much longer. Yet he still finds
time for sports, meetings, social func-
tions and a whole host of other distrac-
tions. “Activities apart from academic
life,” states the Undergraduate Student
Manual, “form an integral part of the
fife of the student at Notre Dame.”
The task of overseeing this “integral
part”—the other three-fourths of New-
man’s “whole man”: his spiritual, physi-
cal and social facets, along with not a
little of his intellectual side as well—
falls on the Office of Student Affairs,
the unassuming name given to a major
division of the University Administra-
tion.
The man in charge is Rev. James E.
Norton, C.S.C., vice-president for stu-
dent affairs. It’s his responsibility to
coordinate all non-academic activities
of undergraduate and graduate stu-
-	dents; anything pertaining to their
:	religious, social, recreational, physical
'	and disciplinary life is his domain. This
.	covers just about everything but studies.
•	In this broad bailiwick, however, the
vice-president for student affairs parcels
*	out the religious and regulatory func-
tions to the prefects of religion and dis-
cipline. Hall rectors and prefects,
faculty advisors and directors, and
student representatives also aid him.
a	Their assistance is one reason why
■	4 Notre Dame
Father Norton can sport his everpre-
sent disarming smile. Another is his
wide experience, which had exposed
him to Uncle Sam’s Marines and Paci-
fic islanders before he began teaching
and administering at Notre Dame.
Hoosier bom, he entered the Con-
gregation of Holy Cross in 1923, re-
ceived his bachelor’s degree from Notre
Dame in ’29 and after completing his
theological studies in Washington, D.C.
returned to his native Indianapolis for
ordination. With an M.A. from Catho-
lic University he began teaching in
1934 at St. Edward’s University, Aus-
tin, Texas.
Ten years later his spiritual services
were being meted out to members of
all the U.S. armed forces, to troops
of our allies and to the natives of Ulithi
Atoll in the Western Caroline Islands.
For 14 months at this pacific base as
chaplain to Marine Aircraft Group 45,
Lt. Norton served a parish of 5,000
soldiers, sailors and marines and acted
as pastor to the native Micronesian
population.
He received a citation for distin-
guished service from the Marine Corps
for his work at Ulithi.
After nearly three years of active
duty as a Naval Reserve chaplain,
Father Norton resinned his teaching,
this time at Notre Dame as an assistant
professor in the Department of Eco-
nomics, specializing in labor problems
and industrial relations.
He was appointed assistant director
of studies in 1948, vice-president for
academic affairs two years later and
student affairs vice-president in June
of ’52.
In his present role, it is his duty,
according to the articles of adminis-
tration, “to establish good order, in the
interest of the physical well-being of
the student body, and to establish and
maintain a realistic and efficient pro-
gram for all student extra-curricular ac-
tivities so that the students may be edu-
cated in the qualities of leadership
through their campus activities, in the
theological virtues through the religious
program and in the moral virtues
through the intelligent observance of
University regulations.”
So vast is the range of student activi-
ties that at times they may seem to out-
number the students. The University
orchestra and bands, glee club, theatre,
debate team, student publications and
campus radio station WSND, through
their directors, are responsible to the
vice-president.
He is advisor to the Student Senate
and its executive arm, the Blue Circle
honor society. All Senate legislation
must have his approval.

The Committee on Discipline at Notre Dame formulates rules of conduct for the student
body. Left to right: Rev. Michael J. Murphy, C.S.C.; Rev. William J. McAuliffe, C.S.C.;
Rev. Robert Pelton, C.S.C.; Rev. Mark J. Fitzgerald, C.S.C.; Rev. Richard J. Grimm, C.S.C.;
Rev. James E. Moran, C.S.C.; and Rev. Charles I. McCarragher, C.S.G. (at desk), Prefect
of Discipline.
lege Students and the National Stu-
dent Association are under his juris-
diction, as are all campus clubs and
student governmental bodies, social
affairs and non-varsity intercollegiate
sports, and all other organized student
activities.
As such he must also supervise use
of the LaFortune Student Center, audi-
toriums, lecture rooms, and recreational
and social facilities. He arranges the
Concert and Lecture Series, the weekly
Washington Hall movies and other
special events of general interest.
In safeguarding the physical well-
being of the students, Fr. Norton is
aided by the University physician and
his assistants, by the sister superinten-
dent of the Students’ Infirmary, by the
managers of the Rockne Memorial and
the Dining Halls, and by the Com-
mittee on Health, which he chairs.
Father Norton also serves as a mem-
ber of the Faculty Board in Control
of Athletics, the Building Committee
and the Budget Committee. He is ex-
officio chairman of the Committee on
Student Affairs and the Committee on
Physical Welfare.
The Student Affairs committee is an
advisory board for student activities,
welfare, religious life and discipline. It
includes four faculty members—two
priests of the Congregation of Holy
Cross and two laymen. Other faculty
members as well as representatives of
the student body may be enlisted tem-
porarily at the discretion of the chair-
man.
The Committee on Physical Welfare
regularly includes the University physi-
cian and all who are directly concerned
with the physical health and welfare of
the students.
These committee meetings and the
weekly Senate sessions, together with the
daily routine of mail, reports and con-
ferences, make Father Norton’s job a
long and busy one. It is made consider-
ably easier, however, by the cooperation
of the students, whom Father Norton
terms “very responsive.”
The well-organized Senate takes over
a sizable share of the work and re-
sponsibility in regulating student activi-
ties, working closely with Father
Norton.
To help maintain these close contacts
with the students and their representa-
tives, the Office of Student Affairs is
handily located on the first floor of the
LaFortune Student Center.
Not so conveniently but rather sym-
bolically situated is the Office of the
Prefect of Discipline—on the not-so-
heavily traversed second floor of the
Administration Building.
The prefect of discipline is Rev.
Charles I. McCarragher, the man
charged with “maintaining a good order
of student life at the University, and
the training of moral character through
adherence to regulations on the part of
the students.”
This involves much more than the
commonplace conceptions of a discip-
linarian, administering the official dis-
ciplinary rules and regulations of the
University.
The prefect of discipline also super-
vises the hall rectors and prefects, as-
signs residence halls for the various
classes and serves as off-campus “rec-
tor” in approving rooms for rental to
students and in supervising the conduct
of off-campus students. This last task
is assigned for the most part to assistant
Patrick Hickey.
Father McCarragher must approve
absences, withdrawals from the Univer-
sity, student employment and campus
advertising. He helps to formulate
rules of conduct (with the Committee
on Discipline), distributes the Student
Manual and maintains a disciplinary
record on every student.
Inasmuch as Notre Dame is a self-
sustaining city with its own heating
plant, post-office, dining hall, mainte-
nance shops, laundry, and residence
halls, the University also employs a
security force to control traffic, direct
visitors, disseminate information and
enforce parking lot regulations. Under
Fr. McCarragher’s jurisdiction the
watchmen and security officers are in
charge of Fred B. Hammer. Other
duties of the prefect of discipline in-
clude enforcing fire-protection rules,
regulating auto privileges and parking
facilities, and controlling arrangements
for swimming, fishing, boating and skat-
ing on Notre Dame’s lakes,
o
His assistant prefect, Rev. William
J. McAuliffe, C.S.C., helps handle the
impressive work load. An assistant pro-.
fessor of music, he is a specialist in poly-
phony and Gregorian chant, a rather
unusual background for his job but
one which makes him nonetheless effec-
tive.
Half of Father McCarragher’s day is
spent talking with students. As many as
a hundred visit his office daily—most
of them voluntarily. Some 60 per cent
appear on matters of absences; others
merely seek information. Only about a

Mr. Carbone is a graduate student at
Notre Dame. He received an A.B. de-

Counseling Service for Students
With Classroom Difficulties
Failing isn’t so easy any more at
Notre Dame.
No, the University hasn’t replaced its
horrendous history departmentals and
laborious lab assignments with snap
courses in ping-pong and basket weav-
ing, but it is helping the student to
clear most of the hurdles that handicap
his pursuit of learning.
Whereas a lad might have once be-
gun at Notre Dame with the mistaken
but hard-to-dispel notion that the quest
for knowledge involved considerable
tilting at professorial windmills, he now
knows that the University’s academic
arm is extended not in opposition but
in aid. Failure is still achievable—and
inevitable — for anyone who sets his
Dr. William Miller Burke (left) and student Richard C. Hauck.
6 Notre Dame
mind to it—or against anything else.
Yet any Notre Dame man who wants
to succeed in his studies will find spe-
cial facilities at his disposal.
In recent years the University has
evolved a thorough program of fresh-
man orientation. The newcomer, even
before he begins his studies, is well in-
doctrinated in the essentials of Notre
Dame life and spirit: the what and
why of its traditions, customs, discipline
and atmosphere.
All this, however, has little effect on
the academic problems which develop
as necessity obliges the student to ad-
just his habits and attitudes, his physio-
logical and psychological constitution,
to the requirements of his curriculum.
The transition from high school to col-
lege courses and the greater work de-
manded may discourage him. The lure
of too many extra-curricular aspects of
university life may distract him. Or,
most commonly, he does not know how
to make the most of his time and
talents; he simply can’t buckle down.
To shepherd the student safely past
such intellectual fog, social byroads and
mental blocks, the University in 1954
established, under the vice-president for
academic affairs, a full-time Office of
Student Academic Advisor. And for
this task of diagnosing, medicating and
curing academic ills, it chose Dr. Wil-
liam Miller Burke, a man with a man-
ner well suited to sugar-coat study, that
bitter pill of scholastic reality.
Dr. (or Mr.—he isn’t particular)
Burke came to Notre Dame’s Depart-
ment of English in 1949, after receiv-
ing his Ph.D. from the University of
Pennsylvania.
His bachelor’s and master’s degrees
were earned at Duke University in the
mid-1930’s. At Duke he was both an
outstanding student and a star baseball
player. He had the unusual distinction
of serving as president of his class dur-
ing freshman, sophomore and junior
years and as Student Government pres-
ident in his senior year. His under-
graduate accomplishments earned him
a graduate fellowship at Duke, and he
held another fellowship while working
on his doctorate at Penn.
To retain a professor’s perspective,
he still takes time out to teach a course
in “Modem European and American
Drama” three hours a week.
Just about old enough to justify a
fatherly approach with his “patients,”
Advisor Burke conducts his private
chats with a student in a casual and
informal yet down-to-earth manner.
Amid so relaxing an atmosphere the
students are most cooperative. In hun-
dreds of interviews, attests Dr. Burke,
none have shown the least resentment.
Many boys are just shy, he says, and
therefore ordinarily reticent about dis-
"si •' , ;	*' . r *' ■	£	*4 ■ k	r
»	• ’>>. * S.-O	X •
cussing their problems. “But they re-
alize that we have no axe to grind,
that we’re on their side.”
By thus combining the functions of
a “Mr. Anthony” with the manner of
a Bernard Baruch, he has been able to
help hundreds of students find the an-
swer to their academic woes.
Dr. Burke, however, does not sit Sol-
omon-like in solitary judgment. The
Office of Student Academic Advisor
works closely with the deans and fac-
ulty, hall rectors and prefects, parents
and the students themselves.
When advisable, the student may be
referred for further assistance to the
Department of Testing and Guidance,
under Edward R. Quinn, to determine
what course and career he is best suited
for, according to his likes and abilities.
Or he may be recommended for Rich-
ard D. Willemin’s Developmental
Reading Program, to teach him how to
get more out of his studies in less time.
Another associate professor of Eng-
lish, Dr. Edward J. Cronin, devotes
part of Iris time to the academic ad-
visor’s office. A 1938 Notre Dame grad-
uate with an M.A. from the University
of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Minne-
sota, he specializes in contacts with the
faculty concerning the students’ work.
He also serves as counselor to proba-
tionary sophoinores.
Also aiding Dr. Burke are Rev. Mat-
thew M. Miceli, C.S.C., an instractor
in religion, and Rev. Paul C. Bailey,
C.S.C., assistant professor of religion.
Study Habits are Analyzed
Father Miceli, a graduate of Notre
Dame in 1947, holds a bachelor’s de-
gree in sacred theology from Gregorian
University in Rome and an S.T.L. from
the Catholic University of America.
Father Bailey received his bachelor’s
from Notre Dame in 1941, his master’s
and doctor’s degrees from Catholic U.
On Wednesday evenings, Dr. Burke
meets with Dr. Cronin, Fathers Bailey
and Miceli, Mr. Quinn and Mr. Wille-
min to review a few of the more diffi-
cult “case histories.”
Each comes prepared to review some
aspect of the student’s problem. Dr.
Burke has interviewed him; Dr. Cronin
has consulted his instructors. Mr.
Quinn can call upon the results of the
boy’s aptitude and preference tests,
while Mr. Willemin may report on his
progress in reading ability. The rela-
tion of the student’s conduct to his study
habits has been analyzed by Father
Miceli with the aid of the lad’s hall
rector and prefect and the Prefect of
Dr. Burke reviews “case histories” with the following group (left to right): Dr. Edward J.
Cronin, associate professor of English; Edward R. Quinn, head of Testing and Guidance
Dept.; Father Paul C. Bailey, C.S.C., assistant professor of Religion; and Richard D. Willemin,
head of Developmental Reading Program.
Discipline’s office. As a psychologist,
Father Bailey can relate the student’s
emotional tendencies to his difficulty.
With their composite knowledge,
then, of all the causes and circum-
stances involved, they can determine
the most advisable steps for the in-
dividual student to take in hitting his
intellectual stride toward success as a
scholar.
In a semester’s time, some 60 students
can thus receive special help.
While any student can consult Dr.
Burke or his associates, often without
appointment, the office at present is
primarily concerned with freshmen and'
probationary sophomores in the College
of Arts and Letters and the College of
Commerce.
Before the schoolyear begins, parents
of an incoming freshman receive a
letter from Dr. Burke requesting them
to send him information about their
son’s character, temperament, interests
and hobbies, work habits and health.
They are also asked to write the office
if their son later mentions any problems
of adjustment during his first semester.
In his letter Dr. Burke invites the
parents, if they should visit Notre
Dame, to stop by Room 140 of the Ad-
ministration Building “to say ‘hello’.”
A gratifying number do. During the
three-day Freshmen Orientation Week-
end at the start of the schoolyear, some
200 mothers and fathers visited the
advisor, while hundreds of others have
written him about their sons. Even
throughout the term, an average of
four or five parents each week call at
the office.
Parents, however, are not the princi-
pal source of information on their sons’
academic difficulties. The University
has established specific procedures to
help the deficient student before it’s
too late.
At mid-semester parents of students
in danger of failing are notified by the
University. But Dr. Burke and his staff
have been alerted long before. Early
in the semester the counseling office re-
ceives a list of all freshmen who are
not, at that time, passing their courses.
Those doing poorly in two or more
courses are automatically interviewed.
The rectors and prefects in each of
Notre Dame’s 15 residence halls also
receive the list of deficient students,

are functionally designed with built-in
closets and furnished in modem decor.
15th Student Residence Hall
Pangbom Hall is the fifteenth stu-
dent residence hall on the Notre Dame
campus and it was first occupied at the
start of the current school year in
September.
The donors, Thomas Pangbom and
John Pangbom, are president and vice-
president respectively of the Pangborn
Corporation in Hagerstown, one of the
world’s largest manufacturing plants of
blast cleaning and dust control equip-
ment. For many years the Pangborn
brothers through the Pangbom Foun-
dation have supported religious, chari-
table and educational projects with
generous grants.
In addition to being an active mem-
ber of Notre Dame’s Advisory Council
for Science and Engineering, Thomas
Pangborn was also awarded an honor-
ary doctor of laws degree at Notre
Dame’s June commencement in 1954.
He has been honored by Pope Pius XII
as a Knight of Malta and a member
of the Equestrian Order of the Holy
Sepulchre of Jesus.
John Pangbom is not only first vice-
president of the Pangborn Corporation
but also serves as treasurer. He is a
member of the St. Vincent College
Advisory Board and has an honorary
doctorate degree from Mt. St. Mary’s
College. Like his brother Thomas, he
too has been prominent in various re-
ligious and charitable organizations.


A MAGNIFICENT GIFT
The Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh,
C.S.G., in extending the University’s
gratitude for the new building said:
“The construction of Pangborn Hall
has made it possible for many stu-
dents who formerly lived off campus
to share in the life and spirit of
Notre Dame. I know I speak for
generations of Notre Dame men in
expressing the University’s gratitude
to Thomas Pangborn and John Pang-
bom for their magnificent gift.”
The remarks made by Mr. Thomas
W. Pangborn at a dinner following
the blessing and dedication of Pangborn
Hall are so appropriately phrased that
the editors have obtained permission to
print his stimulating comments for
the readers of NOTRE DAME.
It is with mixed feelings of pride
and humility, that I speak for bro-
ther John and myself, on this occasion.
Just a little over a century ago, your
founder Father Edward Sorin, of rever-
ed memory, dreamed the dream which
is now the University of Notre Dame.
It was a dream, as Father Hesburgh
once said, that had its roots in Faith.
And it was a glorious dream, as this
beautiful campus and the spirit of
Notre Dame men eveiywhere testifies.
We, brother John and I, are proud
indeed to have some share, however
small, in this dream that is Notre
Dame.
While this campus has grown enor-
mously, since that day 113 years ago,
when Father Sorin visualized this Uni-
versity, Notre Dame is in many respects
the same: hers is the spirit of youth,
full of lofty enthusiasm, dedicated to
inspiring goals, touched with high
ideals. No wonder, that so many giants
have gone forth from this campus, to
make the name of Notre Dame a by-
word for all that is excellent in Chris-
tian education.
There is a particular way of life,
peculiar to each college campus. It
is the character of the school, a way
of life all her own, which, if it has
significance at all, begets a great pride
in her students, that lasts long after life
on the campus has passed.
This pride lives to a marked degree
in all Notre Dame men, because hei'
way of life is built on a more solid
foundation, than that of most schools.
For Notre Dame is dedicated to the
education of the whole man. She
teaches moral and responsible young
men how to learn to lead. She teaches
them how to live, as well as how to
make a living. For over a century,
Notre Dame has consecrated herself in
service to God, to country, and to
American youth. She offers to Ameri-
can boys training, that will be an in-
vestment for all time—an education
based on religion and morality. Notre
Dame believes that if man is responsible
to God, he will be responsible to Iris
neighbors, his family, and his country.
The Integrity of Notre Dame
Part of the peculiar character of
Notre Dame, has been her integrity. In
an age of intellectual confusion and
blundering, Notre Dame has known
exactly the path she must follow. Just
a few years ago, on the occasion of his
elevation to the presidency, here at
Notre Dame, Father Hesburgh, in a
casual remark about football, said, “We
don’t apologize at Notre Dame for our
football. Notre Dame wants to be best
in everything. We want the best coach-
The Most Rev. Loras Lane (right), Auxiliary Bishop of Dubuque and a Notre Dame alumnus, officiated at the
dedication of Pangborn Hall—newest of student residence halls on campus. Others participating in the ceremony
were the donors, John C. Pangborn (left) and Thomas W. Pangborn; Mrs. John Pangborn; and Rev. Theodore.M.
Hesburgh, C.S.C., president. The building is a gift of the two industrialists through the Pangborn Foundation.
The lounge is an attractive feature of the new building.
es and the best professors.” He was, in
a sense, simply restating an academic
principle, that has been a sound one,
since the golden age of Greek culture,
when there were laurel crowns alike,
for artist and athlete.
This emphasis at Notre Dame, on
such diverse things as football and fine
arts, presents a kind of paradox. But
it is easy of solution, for Notre Dame
simply stands, for proper things in their
proper places. Notre Dame teaches life
—the life every undergraduate is going
to live. Many universities give one
preparation for life—preliminary drills.
Or they give training in one set of
interests—in athletics, business, religion
—but always separately. And so the
students miss the magic of proportion,
and missing this, miss life. For life is
a matter: football and flowers, poetry
and pipedreams, sadness and smiles, ex-
ercise and economics.
Every man ought to be able to get
the fullest pleasure possible out of all
he does. Colleges ought to teach him
to do so. Notre Dame does. Here
youths rub elbows with all sorts of
pleasant things, academic and unaca-
demic. They learn to five, just as they
would like to live, right up to the sun-
set of their lives. And so on graduation,
a Notre Dame man, can be put squarely
on the two feet, that are to bear him up
the path of life. He can work or play,
and he can find the golden mean in
all things.
This, I think, is the heart of Notre
Dame. Because we believe so strongly
in what you do here, brother John and
I are here today. For this reason Pang-
bom Hall has risen on this campus.
Indeed it is this spirit—this trust in
Notre Dame and the heritage she off-
ers—that is responsible for every other
campus: for Sorin and Badin, for
Lobund and Moreau Seminary, and
for all the others.
There is a magic to Notre Dame,
that has fired the imagination of people,
all over this great country of ours—
people who like myself, are tagged the
“subway alumni.” It is due in part to
the wizardry of Rockne and Leahy,
but it is a testament also to Sorin and
Corby, to Zahm and Nieuwland, to
George Gipp and Vern Sneider. They
are all a part of the legend. They
are men who have risen above others,
in their own time, and earned a fame,
which they shall ever enjoy.
. to Grow in Wisdom . .
Pangbom Hall, then is no selfish
monument, to brother John or myself.
It is a favor rather that Notre Dame
does us—for here other generations of
Notre Dame men, will rise up, school-
ed in the rich traditions of this great
University, to “grow in wisdom and
grace and age before God and man.”
They will be taught, as all Notre
Dame men have been taught, from the
log cabin of Father Sorin, to the
present splendor of this campus—the
necessity of integrity, the' simple gran-
deur of honest labor, the nobility of
character. They will live, with charity
and aspiration, and godliness. They
will distinguish themselves in industry,
science, literature, the church, state-
craft, and every pursuit, that aids man-
kind, in its search for betterment and
happiness. Some of them will be almost
unknown, outside their own immediate
circle, but they will be exemplary citi-
zens, good sons, husbands, and fathers,
practicing the simple hardy virtues they
learned at Notre Dame. By word and
example, they will make worthwhile
contributions, to American life.
Like the students in Sorin, Walsh,
Dillon, Fisher, and all other residence
halls here at Notre Dame, new groups
of students, will build up a history here
in Pangborn Hall, which they will trea-
sure and pass on, to generations of in-
coming students. They will be true sons
of this great University—loyal to God,
to country, and to Notre Dame.
A Byword for Greatness
This is the greatest satisfaction that
a man can have—to know that he has
played a part, however small, in an
undertaking such as this. For a man
is a little thing when he works by and
for himself. All talent, all wealth, all
power is but a trust which we must
improve and pass along. He who uses
his trust wisely becomes, under the
providence of God, the shaper of
another’s destiny. He never really dies
—for his influence goes on and on,
through the ages, long after men have
forgotten his name. Thus the staunch
patriot, begets or safeguards a nation,
the saint begets other saints, a loving
father begets an upright son, a God
become man redeems a world.
No where is this more obvious, than
here at Notre Dame, where for over a
century, great and wise teachers, with
the ’dedicated support of enlightened
advisors and trustees, have made this
institution a byword for greatness.
And so Pangbom Hall stands here
as a mark of our belief and trust in
Notre Dame. Let it mark our personal
esteem for you devoted priests, lay pro-
fessors, and others whose lives are un-
selfishly dedicated to good. Let it sig-
nalize our loyalty to God, to country,
and to the youth of America.
May the dear Lord, ever prosper and
bless this glorious institution, and all
those past, present and future, whose
labors and sacrifices, have meant and
will mean, so much to so many of His
children.

... everything but studies ...
(Continued from Page 5)
tenth of the daily influx have been
“called on the carpet,” most of them
for minor offenses.
They know that the man confront-
ing them is not likely to tip either of
the scales of justice too heavily. They
can be sure of a fair hearing and a
fair judgment. Sixteen years of teach-
ine', all but three in Notre Dame’s De-
02
partment of Sociology, four years in
his present position, and 20 in all as
a priest have amply qualified him as
an authority ort student character and
characters.
Fr. Carey edits Religious Bulletin
The background of the prefect of
religion, Rev. Charles M. Carey,
C.S.C., similarly suits him for his task.
He has served variously as a faculty
member (English and religion), hall
rector, administrator (as vice-president
in charge of student welfare in 1951-
52), journalist (associate editor of Ave
Maria, weekly national Catholic maga-
zine published at Notre Dame) and
director of publications for the Uni-
versity.
Father calls upon his editing and
writing skills to produce the Religious
Bulletin, an institution at Notre Dame
since Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., now
archbishop of Philadelphia, captivated
the students with it in the ’20s.
Intended “to notify, explain and in-
spire,” the mimeographed sheet reaches
the students three or four times weekly
with readable and memorable items
on their faith and morals, and a fre-
quent push or gibe to stir up their
more inert virtues.
The prefect of religion is responsible
for the religious program at the Uni-
versity—maintaining facilities for daily
Mass and Communion in chapels of
the 15 residence halls, for confessions
and for special services as well as acting
as spiritual advisor to the students.
Students will consult Father Carey
in his Dillon Hall office on many mat-
ters but most of their problems involve
spiritual troubles or explanations of
Church doctrine.
The campus religious program is
administered by the Committee on Re-
ligion, headed by Father Carey and
composed also of the four Holy Cross
priests who serve as assistant prefects
of religion. Each serves a student class,
Father Carey acts as senior class chap-
lain, while Fathers Clement Kane, Wil-
fred Menard and Daniel O’Neill re-
spectively aid the juniors, sophomores
and freshmen. Father Joseph Barry, in
addition to his duties as pastor of
Sacred Heart Church, is chaplain to
undergraduate and graduate students
o	o
living off-campus.
Father Carey’s callers are not limited
to students. High schools consult Notre
Dame in developing their own religious
programs j businesses seek information
on the religious background of Notre
Dame men.
For them and particularly for know-
ledge of the effectiveness of the religi-
ous program, the prefects of religion
recently conducted a Religious Survey
of undergraduates, a frequent project
in pre-war years.
The results were illuminating on
many points, such as the 78 per cent
who said they receive Communion
weekly or more frequently. Asked
about Notre Dame’s spiritual program,
93 per cent considered it ample, only
two per cent excessive.
Father Carey and his assistants, say
the students, are doing a good job. And
so is Father McCarragher’s department,
the survey verifies.
N.D. offers “Wholesome Social Life”
Conceding that “disciplinary regu-
lations are always unpopular,” the
questionnaire asked the students if they
found them helpful to their religious
and intellectual life. Sixty-four per-
cent said yes.
A majority even considered Notre
Dame to offer adequate opportunities
“for a wholesome social life.”
If the survey is a valid indication—
and there is no evidence to the contrary
—then the Student Affairs administra-
tion, from Father Norton on down, is
successfully doing its part toward the
construction of the “whole man,” the
Notre Dame man.
Academic Troubleshooter
(Continued from Page 7)
talk to each individually and see that
they devote more time to study.
All of these sources, coupled with the
all-important interview, enable the
counselors to pinpoint the student’s
difficulty and suggest a remedy. Some-
times private tutoring may be suggested.
On rare occasions, a student may be
advised to drop a troublesome course
to concentrate on his others. Should a
physical handicap such as poor hearing
or eyesight hinder a student’s attentive-
ness in class, his instructors may be
asked to seat him near the front of the
room.
Often the fault lies with the student’s
knack for wasting time. That’s when
Dr. Burke produces his trusty “time
budget sheet”. On it counselor and
student plot out every hour of the
student’s week, from 8:30 a.m. to
10:30 p. m. Study is given a definite
place on the budget sheet and in the
student’s habits.
Result of the study schedule: a
student who has been doing poorly in
class with haphazard study habits “al-
most automatically” improves.
The effect on the student of such
improvement, whether due to the time
budget and any of Dr. Burke’s patented
or prescribed remedies, is heartening.
Beset with academic difficulties, he may
be 'on the verge of abandoning both his
college career and his self-confidence.
After counseling, however, he at least
knows his trouble, knows that it can
be licked, and knows what he must
do to lick it.
Almost equally appreciative are the
rectors and instructors at having their
charges back in the fold.
As for the parents, this reaction from
a Boston newspaperman is typical:
“Ever since our son was accepted for
entrance, my wife and I have been
pleasantly impressed by Notre Dame’s
attitude of personal interest in students.
I’ve never seen its equal in any college.”
And to Dr. Burke and his aides, there
can be no greater satisfaction than that
of helping a lad save himself from in-
tellectual oblivion.
MASS INTENTIONS
The Notre Dame Foundation
office frequently receives letters
of inquiry regarding the possibil-
ity of having Masses said by the
priests on campus.
It has just been announced
that arrangements have been
made whereby both High and
Low Mass Intentions will be dis-
charged by the Holy Cross Fath-
ers assigned to the University of
Notre Dame.
You are invited to mail your
Mass Intentions to:

Getting the most out of Notre
Dame’s endowment funds by
wise and profitable investment is the
task of the University’s Associate Board
of Lay Trustees. Created in 1920, the
board at present is composed of 12
alumni and 10 non-alumni—all out-
standing leaders in industry and the
professions and thoroughly experienced
in business and financial matters.
Four University officials complete
the board. These ex-officio members
are the Provincial of the Indiana Prov-
ince of the Priests of the Congrega-
tion of Holy Cross, Rev. Theodore J.
Mehling, C.S.C.; the President of the
University, Rev. Theodore M. Hes-
burgh, G.S.G.; the University’s Execu-
tive Vice-President, Rev. Edmund P.
Joyce, C.S.C., and the University’s
Vice-President for Business Affairs,
Rev. Jerome J. Wilson, C.S.C.
Lay trustees serve on the board for
renewable terms of six years.
Alumni members of the board are:
Messrs. Thomas H. Beacom, ’20, Chi-
cago; Joseph M. Byrne, Jr., T5, New-
ark, N. J.; Terence B. Cosgrove, ’06,
Los Angeles; Joseph F. Donahue, T2,
South Bend; Walter Duncan, T2, La-
Salle, Ill.; Timothy P. Galvin, ’16,
Hammond, Ind.; Byron V. Kanaley,
’04, Chicago; Joseph A. LaFortune,
T6, Tulsa; John P. Murphy, ’12,
Cleveland; John C. Tully, ’ll, Salinas,
Calif.; Bernard J. Voll, T7, South
Bend, and Frank C. Walker, ’09, New
York.
Included among the members at
large are: Messrs. Edward J. Doyle of
Northfield, Ill.; Charles T. Fisher, Jr.
of Detroit; J. Peter Grace, Jr. of
New York; John L. McCaffrey of Chi-
cago; and C. Roy McCanna of Bur-
lington, Wis.
Other non-alumni members are:
Messrs. Robert L. Oare, South Bend;
I. A. O’Shaughnessy, St. Paul, Minn.;
Raymond H. Reiss, New York; George
W. Strake, Houston, and Harold S.
Vance, South Bend.
Normally 24 lay members comprise
the board; two non-alumni vacancies
are still to be filled.
When a vacancy occurs, the board
president appoints two members
(alumni, if it is an alumni vacancy,
non-alumni if a member-at-large posi-
tion is to be filled) to serve with the
University president as a nominating
committee. Their candidate must then
be approved by the board.
Current officers, elected by the
board for one-year terms, are Presi-

dent Murphy, Vice-President Reiss and
Treasurer Beacom. Although the pres-
ident and vice-president may succeed
themselves for only a second term, the
treasurer may be reelected from year
to year.
Appointed by Notre Dame’s presi-
dent, 'University Investment Officer
William J. Broderick, as a representa-
tive of the University’s financial staff,
serves as secretary and assistant treas-
urer for the board. As such he is
charged with keeping accounts, depos-
iting funds and securities and prepar-
ing financial reports.	•
The board employs the New York
investment counselling firm of Brun-
dage, Story & Rose to assist in making
investment recommendations.
Since the board is primarily con-
cerned with holding, investing and ad-
ministering endowment and other
funds totalling some $12,600,000, the
responsibilities involve more than can
be handled at its one-day meetings
each May and November at Notre
Dame. Thus the financial activities of
the board throughout the year devolve
upon a Finance Committee, consisting
of the board treasurer and seven other
trustee members appointed by the pres-
ident of the board. A majority of the
committee must approve all invest-
ments.
In addition to Treasurer Beacom the
Finance Committee includes Messrs.
Voll (chairman), Doyle, McCaffrey,
Oare, Tully, Vance and Fisher. Mr.
Broderick serves as committee secre-
tary.
At each semiannual meeting the
Board of Lay Trustees renders a de-
tailed statement of funds and invest-
ments held by the board and receipts
and disbursements during the six-
month period. A certified public ac-
countant annually audits the board’s
accounts.
Investing endowment and other
funds, however, is not the sole func-
tion of the Associate Board of Lay
Trustees. It also serves the University
in an advisory capacity on some mat-
ters other than financial.
The board by-laws call for two spe-
cial advisory committees—on alumni
and public affairs, and on administra-
tive and educational affairs—each ap-
pointed by the president of the board
and acting only on matters designated
by the University president.
The Advisory Committee on Alumni
and Public Affairs considers policy
matters involving the alumni and the
general public, publicity and the Notre
Dame Foundation. Messrs. Walker
(chairman), Byrne, Donahue, LaFor-
tune, Murphy and Reiss comprise the
group. In their most recent semi-
annual report, for example, they re-
viewed “significant national develop-
ments in the field of corporate support
of education.”
Composed of Messrs. Cosgrove,
Duncan, Galvin, Grace, Kanaley,
O’Shaughnessy and Strake, the Advis-
ory Committee on Administrative and
Educational Affairs is consulted on pol-
icy matters relative to administrative,
financial and educational questions.
They are also responsible for recom-
mendations regarding the University’s
multi-million dollar building program.
Members of the Associate Board of
Lay Trustees serve without compensa-
tion. Nor can they profit from the
purchase or sale of securities or the in-.
vestment of funds in the board’s con-
trol. But their office is more than
merely honorary or titular.

otre dame, already famed for its
pioneering experiments in aero-
nautical science, its germ-free life labor-
atories and its synthetic rubber achieve-
ment is now the workshop for an inter-
nationally-acclaimed artist, Ivan Mes-
trovic—recognized as the greatest living
sculptor of religious art. The cele-
brated 71-year old Croatian, who was
on Syracuse University’s staff from
1947 until this past Summer, is now a
member of the faculty at Notre Dame
under the Distinguished Professors Pro-
gram. Mestrovic’s works have been
included in exhibitions throughout the
world for half-a-century.
He is probably best known for the
following artistic creations: portraits of
President Jan Masaryk of Czechoslo-
vakia, President Herbert Hoover, Pope
Pius XI and Pope Pius XII. Also, the
memorial chapel to the Unknown
Soldier in Belgrade; two equestrian
statues in bronze of Kings
Ferdinand
I and Carol I of Rumania; and four
stone reliefs representing St. Girolamo,
Pope Sixto V, Pope Leon X and Pope
Pius XII.
One of his most outstanding works
is La Pieta, a magnificent marble statue
of Mary holding Christ’s crucified body.
Valued at $150,000 it has been placed
in Sacred Heart Church on the Notre
Dame campus and is a gift of the artist
to the University. Weighing seven tons
it was formerly on display in New
York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The new $75,000 Sculpture Studio,
was provided through the generosity of
Mr. I. A. O’Shaughnessy, who also was
the donor of Notre Dame’s $2,500,000
O’Shaughnessy Hall of Liberal and
Fine Arts. The building; will be used
by Professor Mestrovic and his students
for their studios, and it is located ad-
jacent to O’Shaughnessy Hall.
Mestrovic was born in 1883 in
Vrpolje, Yugoslavia, of peasant parents.
His extraordinary talent appeared when
he

“Pieta,” the marble statue by Pro-
fessor Mestrovic and valued at
$150,000, depicts Christ being re-
moved from, the cross. It is a gift
to the University by the sculptor
and is now installed in Sacred
Heart Church on campus.

mason. Two years later he went to
Vienna and studied sculpturing under
Prof. Heller at the Vienna Academy
of Fine Arts. The first exhibition of
his early works in Vienna attracted
considerable attention and even then he
was regarded with high esteem by
critics.
Before the first World War, Mestro-
vic’s art inspired the Croatian people
in their fight for emancipation from
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Despite
his emergence as a political figure
Mestrovic shunned public office and
even resigned as a member of Parlia-
ment soon after his election. When
Croatian and Serbian nationalists were

dedicated last Fall and is now occupied by
Professor Mestrovic and his students.
The building is connected with
O’Shaughne'ssy Hall of Liberal and Fine
Arts by a covered walkway. Mr. and Mrs.
O’Shaughnessy also provided funds
for the erection of the $2,250,000
O’Shaughnessy Hall which houses the
College of Arts and Letters.

threatened with imminent arrest at the
outbreak of the war, Mestrovic fled to
Italy. During the war years he helped
form the Yugoslav Committee whose
objectives were achieved at the close of
that conflict with the emergence of the
new nation of Yugoslavia.
Shortly after coming to the United
States, Mestrovic made art history when
he was invited to give a one-man exhibi-
tion in the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York City. In the seventy-
seven years of its history this privilege
has been extended to very few artists.
In 1954, preceding his naturaliza-
tion as an American citizen, Mestrovic
was received at the White House, along
with 20 other well-known applicants,
by President Eisenhower. This past
year he was given the American Insti-
tute of Architects’ highest award, the
Fine Arts Medal “for his tremendous
contribution to the field of sculpture
and painting.”
Mestrovic is not only one of the best
artists but also one of the most prolific.
In the past four years, he has produced
17 pieces of sculpture in marble and
bronze, nine oil paintings, six large
wooden reliefs, and many drawings.
One of his most extensive projects has
been a series of 29 wood panels of the
Life of Christ. The panels, most of
which are six feet high were begun in
1917 and finished last year. They were
sent to his home, now a museum, as a
gift to the Croatian people.
In speaking of his works and of his
own development, Mestrovic says,
“After I had finished art school and
my first period of artistic activity, re-
ligious subjects as well as religion itself
did not interest me as it did not interest
most of my generation.
“During the first world war, seeing
more of the evils of war, the killing of
human beings, the destroying of spiritual
values, and very often, the falsifying of
truth, I became disturbed and began
to ask myself about the real motives
of human struggle and conflicts and
the catastrophic results for all.
“No other force outside of religion
can bring peace, I thought to myself,
until man is able to identify his real self,
his other than material self.”
Mestrovic believes that sculpture,
and art in general, should contribute
to human civilization, to human pro-
gress and to mankind’s spiritual de-
velopment. All great art must be “ex-
pressed within the limits of form.” His
sculpture is contemporary, but it bears
an unmistakable pre-classical influ-
ence. His work reflects force, emotion,
a modern flair and yet it is easy to
understand and relate to familiar
classics of the past. The tremendous
popular appeal of Mestrovic’s art is
perhaps its greatest success.
It is reasonable to assume that his
position on the Notre Dame faculty
will focus world-wide attention on the
University’s Fine Arts program and his
work will continue to reflect the richest
traditions of Christianity.
Ivan Mestrovic’s artistic mission is
simply defined: to lend his talent to
the task of beautifying the world—of
working toward the greatest common
good.
