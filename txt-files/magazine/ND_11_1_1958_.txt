Entered as 2nd class matter May 10, 1948, at post office of Notre Dame, Ind., under Act of Aug. 24, 1912. Published quarterly, Vol. XI, No. 1, 1958.
Notre Dame’s progress has been aided
by many factors, chief of which have been
the dedicated lives of its faculty and the
financial support received from its alumni
and friends, from foundations and corpora-
tions. As demanded by the times in which
we live, the magnitude of this financial sup-
port has increased mightily during the past
decade. To afford you an interesting com-
parison, the benefactions of the first cen-
tury of the University’s existence are shown
side by side with those of the last decade.
The latter period coincides with the birth
of the University of Notre Dame Founda-
tion, and reflects the success of organized
effort to assure financial support for the
University’s ideals and dreams.
The most important message of this
brochure, however, is the announcement of
Notre Dame’s program for the next ten
years. I have already written, in a little
book recently published, Patterns for Edu-
cational Growth, something of my own
vision of the intellectual opportunity of
Notre Dame. Here, however, I am merely
speaking of Notre Dame’s concrete needs.
A goal of $66,600,000 has been set to pro-
vide the University with the financial re-
sources necessary to consolidate and to
further its academic excellence. As in the
past, we look with confidence to our alumni
and friends, to foundations and corpora-
tions, whose growing generosity provides
the means to realize Notre Dame’s hopes
for tomorrow.

K_/n 1842, the University of Notre Dame was founded
on faith in Almighty God — and an ‘operating budget’ of $400.
It has changed considerably in physical characteristics, from a
rustic log cabin to 55 major buildings on a magnificent 1,000-
acre campus. Enrollment has increased to a present-day total of
about 5,800. The teaching staff numbers approximately 500, a
great many of whom are learned scholars from renowned univer-
sities throughout the world. In the early days, payment of tui-
tion was often by barter; today all transactions are in U. S. cur-
rency.
All of these things, and many more, have happened during
the past 115 years. However, in some respects Notre Dame re-
mains the same as it was when Father Sorin, other priests and
seven Holy Cross Brothers taught “the complete English
course”, bookkeeping and astronomy in 1844. Notre Dame men,
then and now, have a deep reverence for the Blessed Mother —
Our Lady for whom this institution is named. And the Univer-
sity of Notre Dame still believes that a man should be educated
in high standards of life.
Perplexing problems and financial shortcomings tested the
fortitude and courage of these pioneer educators. For the first
few years, moral support was abundant but monetary assistance
came in varying degrees. As Notre Dame grew in prestige a cor-
responding interest has been manifested by alumni and friends
alike. Their generous benefactions have immeasurably aided this
University to offer intellectual and moral culture in the train-
ing of American youth.

/ t is both history and tradition at
Notre Dame that God and His Blessed Moth-
er provide people and events that are more
than equal to the crises created during a hun-
dred and fifteen years of dynamic develop-
ment.
In 1947, facing the enrollment tide after
World War II, knowing the great opportu-
nity for private higher education, and recog-
nizing the imminent harvest of long-sown
seeds of scholarship and research, the Uni-
versity was also faced with the intense prob-
lems of rising costs and the pressures to en-
courage faculty stature.
Five years earlier, in 1942, in spite of its
war-vetoed centennial observance, the Uni-
versity had sanctioned the establishment of
the Annual Alumni Fund, and had created an
office of Public Relations to preserve and to
promote non-alumni contacts with friends
and benefactors.

he Log Chapel, a restoration of the
original built in 1842, is located on the banks
overlooking St. Mary’s Lake. Throughout
the early years, Notre Dame’s development
was seriously hampered by the absence of in-
coming revenue. One of the principal bene-
factors was Rev. Stephen Theodore Badin,
the first priest ordained in the United States,
who donated the land for Notre Dame through
the intermediary of the Bishop of Vincennes.
Father Badin also owned property in Louis-
ville and offered it to Father Sorin in return
for an annuity of $400 until his death. From
the transaction Notre Dame received a profit
of $2800. Long after he died, the remains of
Father Badin were returned to the campus
and he is buried under the Log Chapel. A
stone tablet, embedded in the floor, and a
student dorm, Badin Hall, serve to remind
alumni and friends of this generous priest.

In 1947, Harry G. Hogan, Fort
Wayne attorney, banker, business
man, civic and political organization
veteran, and far-sighted alumnus, was
the president of the Notre Dame
Alumni Association. In the Universi-
ty’s problems as outlined by Father
John J. Cavanaugh he saw immediate-
ly the basic need for a widespread field
force of alumni, and instituted such an
organization to supplement a network


i >' j i	£
Throughout 1947, President Ho-
gan, with Father Cavanaugh, the
Alumni Board, and the Lay Trustees,
studied patterns and procedures, and
emerged with the basic structure of the
University of Notre Dame Foundation.
The Foundation was organized as
an entity, separate from the Alumni
Association, but working with a field
force of volunteer alumni, serving as
State Governors and Foundation Com-
mitteemen or Chairmen in every key
city of the U. S. It utilized the exist-
ing Alumni Fund and the Public Re-
lations office fund-raising programs as
separate but co-ordinated bases for the
larger development of the Foundation
program ahead.
From the beginning, the Founda-
tion has identified itself not as a fund-
raising unit to solve the University’s
problems, but as the agency to co-
ordinate existing fund-raising efforts
and to stimulate development of these
efforts and the creation of new efforts
as circumstances dictate.


To dramatize its 1947 objectives, the
University’s needs were carefully analyzed,
and after reference to administrative pro-
nouncements, to alumni and Lay Trustee
opinions, and a study of potentials, the Uni-
versity announced a goal of $25,000,000 over
a 10-year period to meet the various require-
ments of faculty, student and physical plant
development. Active work on this unprece-
dented goal was begun by the Foundation in
1948.
After his successful direction of the
pioneering program of the Foundation, Harry
Hogan was succeeded as Foundation head by
Frank C. Walker, New York City, former
cabinet member, and also a veteran of vari-
ous types of national organization. Under
these men, and with the growing interest and
cooperation of alumni and Trustees, the pro-
gram of the Foundation expanded. Since
1953, Father Cavanaugh has been its full-time
active Director.
The Annual Alumni Fund grew in par-
ticipation and amount. Gifts from non-alumni
friends increased in number and amount.
Capital gifts of tremendous significance in-
creased, as this book shows. The atmosphere
of progress was translated from the field of
philanthropy to the fields of academic ad-
vance and faculty development. Programs of
corporation solicitation, staffed by five full-
time Foundation area directors, and of ap-
peals to philanthropic foundations, were add-
ed. Latest among the significant fields origin-
ally outlined, and now approached actively,
is the great traditional area of estate plan-
ning, including wills and bequests, and insur-
ance.
This book indicates the more than suc-
cessful accomplishment of the $25,000,000
ten-year goal. But the Foundation, its found-
ing fathers, the staff, and the University ad-
ministration and faculty, know that while
this is a miraculous milestone in the rich his-
tory of the University, it is on a road that
has no terminal.

Ij rgently-needed new buildings, dollar-aid for faculty,
additional endowment, special funds for the library and nation-
ally-known campus publications, and financial assistance for de-
serving students were major items in the University’s develop-
ment plan to obtain $25,000,000 over a 10-year period.
Although a nation-wide volunteer field force was organized
in 1947, active work on the program was not started until 1948.

n a brief 11-year period,
Notre Dame’s ‘frontier campus’ ex-
panded rapidly. By 1853 nine, major
buildings were erected, an inspiring
tribute to the resourcefulness of Father
Sorin and his hardy band of co-work-
ers. Included among the facilities were
an Administration Building; a Post
Office, granted largely through the ‘au-
thority’ of Henry Clay; the Church;
maintenance shops and bakery; the
novitiate; Old College; the new infir-
mary and the old infirmary (later used
for classrooms); and the Log Chapel.

he University of Notre Dame was nearly 60 years old
before its residents were “introduced” to the blessings of central
heating. As the campus expanded with new buildings, and in-
creased in number of students and faculty, it became necessary
to effect certain other improvements. In 1952, major changes
were made requiring an outlay of

Included were alterations for the steam plant, construction
of new underground tunnels, installation of a sewage disposal
system and enlarged areas for student outdoor recreation.

ENDOWMENT

his amount was derived from
a campaign which included gifts of
$250,000 from the Rockefeller Founda-
tion and $25,000 from the Carnegie
Foundation. Income from Father
Nieuwland’s neoprene patent and
$120,000 from appreciative alumni were
also part of the total. The wise in-
vestment of these funds was of prime
importance because it afforded the
University an opportunity to raise
faculty salaries.
C : he phenomenal growth of
Notre Dame’s endowment between
1947 and 1957 is attributed to prudent
investments, principally on the recom-
mendations of the Associate Board of
Lay Trustees, and through unrestrict-
ed gifts from alumni and non-alumni
friends.
Notre Dame still has one of the
lowest endowments of any major uni-
versity (e.g. by comparison, Harvard’s
total is $390,000,000 at ‘book value’),
and it is significant that the amount
has almost quadrupled in ten years.
The major portion of income from en-
dowment has been added (annually)
to the principal fund.

DISTINGUISHED PROFESSORS
(/1/ ith the inception of the Faculty Development Pro-
gram in 1953, corporations and foundations were invited to un-
derwrite an additional 45 renowned professors. It has remained
an integral part of the general plan and an amount totaling
more than
$555,837
excluding the Ford Foundation, has been contributed by 706
corporations and foundations.
From the beginning it was estimated that the Distinguished
Professors Plan would necessitate a -yearly cost of $450,000
minimum. They were classified as permanent and visiting pro-
fessors, lecturers and symposia participants.

Forty-four distinguished professors including 9 permanent
appointments have been brought to Notre Dame through the

LIVING CHAIRS
^^/he “Living” Chairs Plan crystallized in 1956 as an-
other facet of the overall program to subsidize teacher salaries
based on the correlation of ‘student cost’ and its deficit. It is an
established fact that the Notre Dame student pays approximate-
ly two-thirds of the cost required to educate him. The difference
is derived from endowment, auxiliary enterprises and gifts of
alumni, non-alumni friends and corporations.

rom its budget the University pays $250,000 annually
to approximately 700 students working on campus. In the last
10 years, Notre Dame has paid almost $2,500,000 to students
needing a ‘financial lift’.
You have just finished reading a compilation of facts and figures about
Notre Dame’s first 115 years. The amazing progress of an internationally-
known University has been traced in contrasting periods from a “one
building campus” to a multi-million dollar educational plant.
These achievements stem in part from dedicated service by Priests and
Brothers belonging to the Congregation of Holy Cross, and because of
generous financial support from alumni and other friends.
If the question were posed: “What has been the most outstanding
achievement at Notre Dame?”, the answer would probably be twofold —
1) the ability to advance under extremely difficult conditions; and 2) the
remarkable academic development through the years. Often it was a
struggle against gigantic odds: poverty, disastrous fires, the plague.
Although the 1947-57 $25,000,000 goal was over-subscribed by $2 million,
Notre Dame cannot rest. The training of American youth in intellectual
and moral culture is to continue; new horizons, new objectives, new con-
cepts must be realized.
A detailed appraisal has been made of the University’s most urgent
requirements during the next decade. The need for faculty funds is
pre-eminent; the other parts of the program are essential.

ENDOWMENT FOR
INCREASED FACULTY SALARIES
$27,000,000
The primary function of any university is to teach and to widen the
horizons of knowledge. Notre Dame’s role as a first-rate academic insti-
tution depends on the excellence of its faculty — and this excellence is
expressed in teaching and discovery. There is a real need for competently-
trained teachers who will devote their careers to the classroom and
laboratory.
Even though salary levels in many fields have risen in proportion to
the cost-of-living index, this is not generally true in the teaching pro-
fession. The individual who spent years and large sums of money
preparing for a teaching position has many of the same needs as the
skilled laborer. They both buy from supermarkets and department stores
but there the similarity abruptly ends.
' At Notre Dame the current median salary for faculty totals $6,400
and this is considerably higher than the national average. In actual
purchasing power, the average professor’s salary is less than 70% of
what it was in 1940. By contrast the average factory worker’s purchasing
•power is now 150% of its 1940 value.
Today, there is competition for great minds not only from other
universities but also from business, industry and the professions.
Notre Dame hopes to increase its faculty salary scale 75% by 1968.
Members of the faculty will receive $3,000,000 in salaries and wages
during the current school year. In seeking $27,000,000, Notre Dame’s
plan is realistically designed for achieving that which is absolutely
necessary if the University is to fulfill its obligations to students and
to society.
The funds will be used to stabilize and strengthen the present faculty
as well as to attract some of the world’s outstanding teachers to this
campus. With the anticipated $27,000,000, salaries can be advanced which
will be appealing to those who possess a talent for teaching.
/ _
It will not be possible to raise these funds entirely through increased
tuition; federal aid is not the answer; and income from the University’s
present endowment of about $20,000,000 is insufficient.
Notre Dame will rely on large and small contributions from many
individuals and corporations if the plan for increasing faculty salaries
is to materialize.

"Living" Chairs
As a part of the general Faculty Development Program, this plan has
already proved attractive to corporations, individuals and alumni clubs.
Announced in 1956 it annually subsidizes faculty salaries based on one-
third of the mean salary within the teaching rank selected.
Donors receive proper credit and recognition for underwriting “Living”
Chairs. A full professorship donated by the Hon. Joseph P. Kennedy
was named by him in honor of Lord Beaverbrook. The professor ap-
pointed to this “Living” Chair was Dr. Matthew’ Fitzsimons of the Political
Science Department.
Sponsorship of “Living” Chairs is evolved from salaries on the various
teaching levels.
	Salary Mean Total	Student Pays	Sifts Required
Professor	$9500	$6000	$3500
Associate Professor	$8500	$5650	$2850
Assistant Professor	$7200	$4800	$2400
Instructor	$5500	$3650	$1850
Distinguished Professors
Contributions for Distinguished Professors have been made by Ameri-
ca’s leading corporations. Industry and business are again asked to
defray salaries of 45 renowned professors to the Notre Dame faculty. The
total amount for this project equals $450,000 annually and gifts have
been made in various denominations.
The plans for “Living” Chairs and Distinguished Professors are,
however, both an integral part of the Faculty Development Program
and are included in the University’s request for endowment of $27,000,000
to provide for increased faculty salaries.

The quest for new knowledge in all fields — in the natural sciences,
law, the social sciences, engineering and in the humanities — constitutes
an integral phase of Notre Dame’s 'program for the future’.
Research contributions, since 1954, have totaled about $750,000 yearly.
These grants from government, industry and foundations have been
used for important experiments in chemistry, biology, physics and other
departments.
Notre Dame’s scientific investigations are concerned with cancer, heart
disease, radiation sickness, tooth decay, synthetic rubber, nuclear studies,
electronics, aeronautics, all of which are related directly or indirectly to
the welfare of mankind. It is imperative, in this age of earth satellites
and long-range missiles, that our technological “know-how” be advanced.
Notre Dame is engaged in “pure” or fundamental research. These labora-
tories will educate imaginative, creative young men who are destined for
leading positions in the industrial world. Formulae learned here will
later be translated into advanced research for a higher standard of living.
Research is one of the University’s vital “nerve centers”. Countless
discoveries in science and engineering may result from its test tubes and
workshops. Notre Dame’s modest request of $11,000,000 in ten years for
this tremendous program is only slightly more than that being given at
the present time.
STUDENT AID
$5,000,000
Thomas Jefferson “established” an early pattern for scholarships and
fellowships when he said, “we hope to avail the state of those talents
which nature has sown as liberally among the poor as the rich, but which
perish without use if not sought there and cultivated.”
This form of Student Aid at Notre Dame has provided college training
for thousands of young men who would have been financially unable to obtain
an education otherwise. Additional funds of $5,000,000 during this decade
are needed for Student Aid on the graduate and undergraduate levels.
Permanent 4-year scholarships for qualified students require a fund
of approximately $65,000; $150,000 will endow a fellowship for graduate
study and research.
Actually, every student at Notre Dame is receiving some “scholarship”
aid because even though he pays the full tuition and all other expenses,
the student defrays only 70% of his educational costs — the remaining
30% is underwritten by the University from gifts, auxiliary enterprises
and endowment income.
Because of this situation and because generous donors are desirous of
extending support to deserving youths, Notre Dame considers its Student
Aid Program to be of paramount importance. In addition to scholarships
and fellowships, the University needs unrestricted funds for direct loans
to needy students.
ADMINISTRATIVE SPECIAL FUNDS
$5,000,000
Just as it is vital that top-caliber men be assigned to teaching positions,
so too the University must have the financial means to employ capable
administrators.
Almost 1600 men and women comprise the University’s lay staff of
administration. Their wise and efficient guidance, from years of on-the-
job experience, is a contributing factor to Notre Dame’s successful
‘century of progress’.
To forestall competition from profit-making institutions, Notre Dame
must be prepared to increase salaries of the administrative staff and to
formulate a much-needed retirement plan.
It will require a minimum capital investment of $500,000 (plus $50,000
annually) to initiate a pension plan for eligible employees. This need
will be classified as a “critical item” in Notre Dame’s appeal for necessary
funds during the next ten years.

NEW BUILDINGS
$18,600,000
Emphasis on Notre Dame’s ‘future program’ spotlights the “internal”
aspects of the University — endowment for increasing faculty salaries;
and funds for research, fellowships and scholarships, and for administrative
personnel. But this doesn’t preclude the erection of new buildings, all
of which are part and parcel of Notre Dame’s 1958-67 projection for
educating American youth.
From the very beginning the Holy Cross Fathers have meticulously
planned Notre Dame’s spacious campus. It has been constructed building
by building, only when deemed necessary — and money was available.
As noted in previous chapters of this brochure, 14 impressive buildings
were made possible by donations from generous benefactors. Named for
their donors, these halls will forever be perpetual memorials on the
University of Notre Dame campus.
The other structures which comprise the campus today are a tribute
to the farsighted management of priest-administrators who prudently built
Notre Dame on faith, determination and a limited ‘operating budget’.
In the 1930’s, and again during the period of 1947-57, new buildings
were erected. Many of these were residence halls designed to accommodate
Notre Dame’s expanding student population.
The University is requesting funds for 7 new structures, and 3 additions
to old buildings which are now inadequate.
w lira®
The $18,600,000 listing includes the following:
(a)	Addition	to the	Hurley College of Commerce---------------$	500,000
(b)	Addition	to the	School of Law____________________________$	500,000
(c)	Addition	to the	Cushing College of Engineering----------$	500,000
(Commerce was built in 1932; Law in 1930; and Engineering in 1933.
There is a need for more classrooms and faculty offices.)
(d)	Library___________________________________________________ $5,000,000
(The ’’heart" of the campus can no longer fulfill its original purpose —
that of providing volumes and adequate space for study. The present
library was constructed in 1917 for an enrollment about one-fourth of
the 5,800 now attending Notre Dame.)
(e)	Two Graduate Residence Halls______________________________$2,500,000
(With the lack of sufficient on-campus facilities for graduate students it
has been necessary for them to live in private homes.)
(f)	Priests Faculty Hall______________________________________ $1,500,000
(A residence for the increasing number of priest members of the faculty.)
(g)	Maintenance Center________________________________________ $ 600,000
The University's utilities shops — carpenter, paint, electric, etc. — are
loused in separate buildings. A centralized location would aid effi-
ciency and economy.)
(h)	Auditorium________________________________________________$3,500,000
(Washington Hall was constructed in 1881 for theatricals and concerts.
It seats about 900 of the total 5,800 enrollment.)
(i)	Fieldhouse _______________________________________________$4,000,000
(The present gymnasium, built in 1898, continues to serve in a limited
way for athletic contests and miscellaneous events. Seating capacity
is approximately 4,200.)
Each of the foregoing structures is an important adjunct of Notre Dame's 'future
program' to raise $18,600,000 for new buildings.
Often it is conceived that Notre Dame is interested solely in big
gifts. This is an erroneous impression. As indicated on the denomina-
tional-giving chart the large percentage of contributions is within the
$1 - $25 category. Regardless of amount, your benefaction to the Univer-
sity of Notre Dame will be gratefully accepted. Unrestricted gifts are
particularly encouraged because the University is permitted to use the
money where the need is greatest.

The following suggestions are offered to alumni and non-alumni friends
who wish to support Notre Dame’s program of educating American youth:
Direct Gift — may be money, stocks, bonds, real estate or physical
things;
Bequest — is less expensive than a gift to the University by the heirs;
Gifts of art, equipment, books, and other objects — are an important
part of the general development plan;
Insurance policy — may assure Notre Dame a large contribution at
small cost by naming the University as beneficiary;
Estate Planning — may include creation of a revocable living trust,
gifts of life insurance, preparation of a will, execution of agree-
ment covering purchase and sale of business interests in the estate,
and many others.
Complete details may be obtained by consulting your attorney, banker,
trust officer or insurance agent.
Contributions are deductible under existing Federal tax laws. Checks
should be made payable to the University of Notre Dame, and mailed to
the University of Notre Dame Foundation, Notre Dame, Indiana.

HARRY G. HOGAN, 04
(Former National Chairmanf Notre Dame Foundation)
One of the prime movers of the Notre
Dame Foundation and a former president
of the Alumni Association is Harry G.
Hogan of Fort Wayne, Indiana, attorney,
businessman, former bank president, civic
leader and long-time active alumnus.
Mr. Hogan was alumni president in 1917-
1918, 1947 and 1948 (honorary president in
1949), and in 1947 became the first National
Chairman of the Notre Dame Foundation.
His administration established a network
of state governors to coordinate the activi-
ties of city chairmen.
A member of the Allen County Bar since
graduation, Mr. Hogan served as prosecu-
ting attorney and Fort Wayne city attor-
ney, and after his discharge as a first
lieutenant in World War I he was named
county attorney. He was first chairman of
the board of governors of the diocesan
Catholic Youth Organization, which he or-
ganized under the direction of the late
Archbishop John F. Noll. He also planned
the present Veterans’ Aid Commission,
which, under his chairmanship, assisted
members of the armed forces and their fam-
ilies in the Fort Wayne area during World
War II. In 1951 the University awarded
him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.
Mr. Hogan retired in January, 1957, as
president and director of Fort Wayne’s
Dime Trust and Savings Bank, which he
organized and directed for 35 years. He
continues as president of the Klett Lumber
Co., treasurer of the Fort Wayne Tool, Die
and Engineering Co., secretary-treasurer
of the Kendick Manufacturing Co., Inc., and
advisor to the Notre Dame Foundation. He
resides in Fort Wayne with his wife, Vir-
ginia.

FRANK C. WALKER, 09
(Former National Chairman, Notre Dame Foundation)
Honorable Frank C. Walker, wartime
Postmaster General of the United States
in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s
cabinet, succeeded Mr. Hogan as National
Chairman of the Notre Dame Foundation.
In 1948 Mr. Walker became the 66th re-
cipient of the Laetare Medal and the fourth
Notre Dame alumnus to be honored as the
nation’s outstanding Catholic layman.
Long a member of the Associate Board of
Lay Trustees, Mr. Walker also was first
vice-president and honorary president of
the Alumni Association during the years
1933-35.
He held several top positions during the
Roosevelt administration. In 1933 he was
executive secretary of the president’s exec-
utive council, sometimes called the “super
cabinet”. Later in the same year he became
head of the National Emergency Council,
and in 1935 he administered a $4 billion pub-
lic works program. Mr. Walker was named
by President Truman as an alternate repre-
sentative to the first United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly, which selected him as U.S.
representative on its Legal Committee.
At an early age his family moved to Mon-
tana and he attended Gonzaga University,
Spokane, Wash., before entering the Notre
Dame Law School. Mr. Walker was a
lieutenant in the Army during World War
I and in 1925 became general counsel and
manager of Comerford Theatres, Inc., a
Pennsylvania-New York chain.
Mr. Walker has long been active in Cath-
olic charities. In 1934 he received an hono-
rary LL.D, from Notre Dame and he holds
honorary degrees from Gonzaga, the Mon-
tana School of Mines' Georgetown, Manhat-
tan College and St. Francis College of
Loretto, Pa.
In 1914 he married Hallie Boucher. They
have two children, Thomas J., ’42, and
Laura Hallie.
