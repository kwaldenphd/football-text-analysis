Three hundred students will reside in Stanford Hall.
Notre Dame's seventeenth student
dorm will be named the Grattan and
Effa Stanford Residence Hall in honor
of the donor and her late husband.
Mrs. Stanford now resides in New York
City. It is part of a three-building
project, totaling $4,000,000 in cost,
now under construction on the campus.
The other student residence has al-
ready been designated as Keenan Hall,
in memory of James F. Keenan, Jr.,
who died in 1941. Funds for this
building were provided by Mr. and
2 Notre Dame
Mrs. James F. Keenan, Sr., of Fort
Wayne, Ind. The dining hall, with
facilities for about 1600 persons, is as
yet unnamed.
Three hundred students will be ac-
commodated in Stanford Hall which
is scheduled for occupancy at the be-
ginning of the fall semester in Septem-
ber. The three structures were de-
signed by Ellerbe and Company of St.
Paul, Minnesota, and are located on
the northeast section of the University’s
1700 acre campus. Stanford Hall is
being constructed of buff brick with
limestone trim and is joined to Keenan
Hall by a central lobby. Students living
in the two buildings will share the same
o
chapel.
In notifying University officials of
her benefaction, Mrs. Stanford ex-
pressed the mutual interest she and her
husband had “in the welfare of Notre
Dame and in advancing the spiritual,
intellectual and moral interest of its
students.” In extending the Univer-
sity’s gratitude to Mrs. Stanford, Rev.

Residence Dorms and Dining Hall Will Be Available

Theodore M. Hesburgh, G. S. G., presi-

of Notre Dame men. It will be a living
memorial to Grattan and Effa Stanford
and to their devotion to the cause of

Mrs. Stanford is a charter member
of the Notre Dame Women’s Advisory
Council which meets twice each year
to advise Notre Dame officials concern-
ing many of the social and cultural
activities of the students.
Work on the new dining hall, a one-
story structure, has been progressing on
the same schedule as the two residence
halls. This building, which will be
made possible through borrowed funds
from the University’s endowment ac-
cording to Father Hesburgh, will be
completely air conditioned and serve
about one-third of the student body.
There will be six dining rooms within
the building and a large storage and
deep freeze area in the basement.
Upon completion of Stanford and

dining hall Notre Dame will have
erected thirteen structures since begin-

Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh,
C.S.C., is Notre Dame’s six-
teenth President.
In this age of jet propulsion, of the
catastrophic hydrogen bomb and of
countless objects perfected by skilled
technicians for mankind’s benefit, we
must link man and science together in
mutual concepts. There is no reason-
able or respectable future for science
unless it be viewed as being of man,
and by man, and for man. Correspond-
ingly, there is no hope for real prog-
ress for modem man unless he keeps
his science in the context of the totality
of his human life.
In a sense, science and scientists can
do no wrong. They have fed and
clothed and housed us as man has
never been fed and clothed and housed
before. Science has cured our diseases,
lighted and warmed and cooled our
homes, simplified our housekeeping. It
has given us printed words by the mil-
lions, entertainment at the touch of a
button from an easy chair, conversa-
tions across continents and oceans.
However, there are limits to the
power of science and science is only
one factor in the achievement of a
good life—if man is more than matter
and if there are human values higher
than those of a material order. Science
may in time destroy man and become
his master, if science is not adequately
understood for what it really is, not
worshipped as a kind of false god, all
out of perspective in regard to its true
meaning and value in the total life of
o
man.
The true meaning of science must
somehow be related to man, his mean-
ing and his destiny. Only man on
earth is the scientist, and his science
is not exercised in a vacuum but in
the world of man. If science loses its
place in that world, man will lose, and
so will science. All power is meaning-
less without direction. Consider then,
that the magnificent power of science
is dangerous, even deadly, if not con-
trolled by human intelligence and in-
tegrity and wisdom.
Our Western world today is no
simple reality — but the amalgam of
many forces that have deeply influ-
enced it over many centuries of time.
One finds as a base the great intel-
lectual heritage that comes from the
classic age of Greece. Here was the
earliest root of the intellectual fibre of
the West—the zest for understanding
and philosophical inquiry, the joy of
intellectual discovery, the deeper values
of the things of the mind: truth,
beauty and the good. The Romans
added another dimension to the tapes-
try of the West, the ideal of law and
order and a stable society of men with
great civic institutions and efficient ad-
ministration of justice. Then there was
the divine element of the Gospels, a
new and bright light on man’s nature
and destiny, a fresh glimpse of the
grandeur of the human person, new
ideals of human thought, human
achievement, and high goals for human
conduct. These three elements meshed
to form the fibre of Western culture.
Notre Dame’s educational program
reflects our concern for preparing
young people today for life tomorrow.
The education that best reflects our
effort to give to youth today the heri-
tage of the past, as well as visions for
the future, is liberal education. If we
can establish the place in value of
science and liberal education, then per-
haps we may gain an insight into the
place of science in the world of man.
All of the scientists u orking with
the most startling scientific equipment
—electronic microscopes, nuclear re-
actors, electronic calculators — cannot
give us the clue to the most burning
o	o
questions that have agonized mankind
since man began to think: What is
man? Can he know truth and what is
it? Is there a God, can we know Him,
and what is our relation to Him? What
is freedom, and are we really free?
What is justice and the function of
law?
Science is tremendously important in
our day, but man is even more impor-
tant. Science will have its greatest, most
fruitful, most meaningful growth when
man, in the totality of his humanity,
grows with it to a total perfection of
which science is a part, but never a
whole, a means to an end, a thrilling
chapter, but certainly not the whole
book.

Dr. Albert F. Zahm, pioneer
of aeronautical science.
A LIVING
MEMORIAL
Notre Dame Receives a Bequest of
$225,000, From Dr. Zahm, With
$100,000 Restricted for Doctoral
Studies at Catholic University
The late Dr. Albert F. Zahm, one
of the world’s great aeronautical scien-
tists, has bequeathed $225,000 to the
University of Notre Dame. A former
faculty member and recipient of the
Laetare Medal, Dr. Zahm established
residence on the Notre Dame campus
in 1953 and died in the University
Infirmary one year later at the age
of 92.
He was recognized as the founder
of modem aeronautical science and his
interest in flying originated when he
was a Notre Dame student in the early
1880’s. Dr. Zahm graduated in the
Class of 1883 and received a master’s
degree from Notre Dame two years
later. He also was awarded a mechan-
ical engineering degree from Cornell
and a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins
University.
He stipulated that the net income
from $100,000 of the total bequest
should be used to finance study for
doctoral degrees at Catholic University
“by as large a number of Notre Dame
pre-doctoral fellows as such income will
permit.”
This distinguished scientist built the
first wind tunnel in 1882 more than 20
years before the famed Wright brothers
were to make their historic flight at
Kittyhawk, North Carolina. Still dis-
playing the same enthusiasm for avia-
tion as in his early years, Dr. Zahm
retired in 1946 after 16 years as chief
of the aeronautical division of the
Library of Congress. From 1916 to
1929 he served as director of the
United States Navy’s aerodynamics
laboratory.
One of his most memorable achieve-
ments was organizing and serving as
the secretary of the International Con-
ference on Aerial Navigation which was
held in Chicago just before the turn
of the century. This meeting still ranks
as a highlight in America’s aeronautical
history.
Dr. Zahm’s early experiments in
flying gliders off the roof of Notre
Dame’s Science Building, now La-
Fortune Student Center, heralded later
outstanding achievements in aeronau-
tical science which we now commonly
know as the jet propelled age.
For the guidance of those considering making a bequest to the
University of Notre Dame, the following form is suggested:
I hereby give and bequeath to the University of Notre Dame du lac, an Indiana corporation, at Notre
Dame, Indiana, the sum of
dollars.
All the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal, I give, devise, and bequeath
to the University of Notre Dame du lac, a corporation, located at Notre Dame, Indiana.

William R. Daley’s practical Invest-
ment Plan for Notre Dame’s College
of Commerce students is an ingenious
idea—designed to provide a working
‘know-how’ for these young men who
will be investing other people’s money
as bank and insurance executives in
the not too distant future. It is
an experiment unique in business
education.
Forty students in Assistant Dean
Thomas T. Murphy’s “Investment”
class are “stockholders” in the $10,000
fund, donated by Mr. Daley, and are
responsible for buying stocks and bonds,
watching the tickertape and keeping
tab on the market. Normally an in-
vestment made by the University of
Notre Dame receives close scrutiny and
personal direction from members of the
Associate Board of Lay Trustees. But
in this instance, the decision will be
made by commerce students after each
has prepared a written analysis of a
particular industry and at least one
company in it.

The benefactor, Mr. Daley, is a man
with ideas and a person who has been
extremely successful in the business and
industrial field. A native of Ohio, he
graduated from Western Reserve Uni-
versity in 1915 and two years later was
the recipient of a law degree from the
same institution. Admitted to the Ohio
Bar in 1917, Mr. Daley took a leave
of absence from his law firm to serve
in the United States Army during
World War I. He later was associated
with the legal firm of Bulkley, Haux-
hurst, Inglis and Saeger. He joined
Otis and Company, an investment or-
ganization, in 1928 and is president and
treasurer of the company. Mr. Daley
is also vice-president and treasurer of
the Portsmouth Steel Corporation, as
well as board chairman of the Ohio
Water Service Co., and the Cleveland
Indians Baseball Company. He is a
trustee of Catholic Charities Corpora-
tion and a member (formerly chair-
man) of Notre Dame’s Advisory
Council for the College of Commerce.
He holds directorships in the following
firms: Nickel Plate Railroad, Cleveland
Cliffs Iron Co., Detroit Steel Corp., and
Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co. Mr.
Daley is chairman of the President’s
Council of Notre Dame Women’s Col-
lege, Cleveland and is a Master Knight
of the Knights of Malta.
He explains that, “It’s one thing to
evaluate a theoretical investment, but
when you’re spending real money. If
the students make the wrong decisions,
the school will lose.” However, Mr.
Daley adds that the fund is not estab-
lished to earn great amounts of revenue
—experience is its real purpose.
The initial purchase of the fund in-
volved two unidentified stocks valued
at $1,300. Only after the entire class
has analyzed the financial "worth” of
various firms is the final decision made
to invest in these companies.
Stocks are bought through Albert
McGann Securities, Inc., a South
Bend agency, by a three-man student
committee. Serving as faculty directors
of the Investment Fund are Dean
James W. Culliton, Assistant Dean
Murphy and Professor LeClair Eells.
Mr. Daley states, “I’m anxious to
see if maybe the students don’t do bet-
ter than the professionals.”
More investments will be made later.
Income from securities sales will go
back into the fund, as will dividends
and interest for five years. After that,
the latter will be used for scholarships,
guest lecturers and other purposes.
Richard Cleary, ’50, vice-president of the McGann Securities Inc., South Bend, Ind., explains intricacies of the stock market to Prof.
Thomas Murphy (right) and members of his ‘investment’ class.

With this new organization provid-
ing a basis for fraternal unity among
the students, its activities were strongly
supported. As alumni carried the
fame of the confraternity throughout
the country and around the globe,
people began to be attracted by this
American “branch office” of the
Lourdes movement. The Notre Dame
Confraternity served as a distribution
a
J

center for the miraculous waters,
swering requests from all over
North American continent. As
Mission Post at Notre Dame grew
a great University the work of
an-
the
the
into
the
Confraternity including the enrolling
of members and the distribution of
Lourdes Water was extended to the

Ninety-nine years ago, Bernadette
Soubirous became a very special figure
in the history of the world’s devotion
to Mary, the Mother of God. At a
grotto in the Massabielle cliff at
Lourdes, Mary appeared to this humble
15-year-old peasant girl and told her,
“I am the Immaculate Conception.”
Built into the side of a hill facing
St. Mary’s Lake, the Grotto of Our
Lady of Lourdes at Notre Dame pre-
sents a striking resemblance to the ac-
tual setting in southern France. A
statue of Our Lady, clad in blue and
white and holding a rosary, stands
majestically in a niche cut out of the
gray stones. Above the icon are the
words: “I am the Immaculate Con-

ception,” emblazoned on a halolike
blue curve of metal. A statue of the
kneeling Bernadette graces the candle-
lit enclosure below the image of Mary.
A daily visit to this lovely shrine has
been included in the routine of the
Notre Dame student for 61 years. As
a vital feature of this university’s dy-
namic religious tradition, it plays a
significant part in the inspiring story
of the development on the campus
of devotion to the Immaculate
Conception.
Back in 1845, just one year after
the university received its charter, the
Archconfratemity of the Blessed Mother
was established by the now legendary
Father Sorin. This was the first major
step in the development of student de-
votion to Christ’s Mother. After the
Lourdes apparitions, devotion to the
Immaculate Conception gained new
fervor. Eventually, it became apparent
that affiliation should be established
with the Archconfratemity of the Im-
maculate Conception at Lourdes. So
the Confraternity was canonically
erected at Notre Dame in 1874 by
Bishop Dwenger of Fort Wayne.
trally located, directly behind the
Grotto of Our Lady.
A center of activity for the Confra-
ternity—the Grotto—was to come at
the end of the nineteenth century. The
Notre Dame Scholastic of September
17, 1898, reporting the death of the
Rev. John Carroll of Oil City, Pa.,
provides this background:
Only three years ago the hill back
of the Community house was
nothing but a bare, brown mound
with an old willow and one or
two poplar trees. Yet on this spot
Father Carroll saw a place on
which to add to his long list of
good works — an opportunity to
enhance the beauty of Notre Dame.
Father Carroll provided the original
contribution for this replica of Lourdes,
which was dedicated in 1896 on the
feast of Our Lady of the Snows. The
statue of the kneeling Bernadette was
added in 1910.
The ties between Lourdes and Notre
Dame have been strengthened by sev-
eral Notre Dame men who have- visited
the Massabielle phenomenon. After the


1939 pilgrimage of polio-stricken Fred
Snite, Jr., he became resigned to his
condition and set out to discover how
he could make the most of his confine-
ment within an iron lung. What a
wonderful life he led! Snite attended
social activities and sporting events (in-
cluding Notre Dame football games,
annually), played bridge and chess,
read extensively, and even produced a
magazine which sparkled with his own
good humor. His life as a self-styled
“boiler kid” from 1936 until his death
in 1954 was a source of inspiration to
people of all faiths.
Van Wallace had attended Notre
Dame for just one academic year before
he fractured his neck in a swimming
accident in 1924. Paralyzed from the
neck down, he nonetheless has travelled
thousands of miles, carried on corres-
pondence with friends and associates
by means of a writing device which he
himself invented, and even ventured
into business as an insurance agent.
The outbreak of World War II forced
the postponement of Van’s trip to
Lourdes, but he eventually realized his
dream in 1947. He is still a cherished
and familiar sight at Notre Dame’s
football games and campus retreats.
Neither Snite nor Wallace showed
any physical improvement which could
be directly attributed to Lourdes, but
it cannot be said that Lourdes had no
effect upon them. It was obvious that
both men had found the shrine an
astonishingly bountiful source of that
intangible reality called spiritual
strength—the ‘peace of soul’ necessary
to carry on.
The ties with Lourdes will be
strengthened this summer when a 1931
graduate, James D. McQuaid of Vin-
cennes, Indiana, will visit Lourdes.
Alumni are playing a major role in
this latest Lourdes episode, for a great
deal of the financial burden of Mc-
Quaid’s trip was alleviated by generous
contributions made at the Notre Dame
summer retreat last year.
These trips, of course, are but high-
lights of Notre Dame’s continual de-
votion to the Immaculate Conception,
and it is the Confraternity which
serves as the strong backbone for this
devotion. Now under the direction of
Rev. Philip H. Schaerf, C.S.C. (who
is making an unexpected and inspiring
recovery from a near-fatal illness), the
Confraternity is stepping up its activity
as it nears the centennial of Lourdes in
1958. Recently, the Bishop of Lourdes
and Tarbes sent a letter to the local
Confraternity encouraging “new life”
to “attract thousands to share in its
spiritual advantages.” Many Notre
Dame men are already enjoying these
advantages, which include a Papal in-
dulgence, the obtaining of Lourdes
water, votive candles at the Grotto, and
Mass intentions. But Father Schaerf’s
fervent wish is to extend the Lourdes
drama to countless others who can
share in Mary’s blessings, perhaps even
in her miracles. Membership is estab-
lished simply by sending one’s name
and address to Lourdes, Notre Dame,
Indiana. By this simple act of enroll-
ment, alumni can open the door to a

strengthening of their spiritual ties with

significance.

Corporations Sponsor
Scholarship Programs
Corporate aid-to-education at Notre Dame is evidenced
by several manifestations. One of the most encouraging
has been industrial and business support of the Faculty
Development Program. In 1956, for example, 363 corpo-
rations and foundations contributed more than two million
dollars to Notre Dame.
Another tangible expression of corporate support and
interest is the subsidization of scholarships. In this article
Notre Dame highlights, pictorially, some of the students
who are benefiting from corporation scholarships. Fre-
quently, the company contributes an additional unrestricted
amount, over and above the usual expenses, which normally
are assumed by the University. It has long been a rec-
ognized fact that the student at Notre Dame, as well as at
other institutions, actually defrays only about 70 percent
of his educational costs. The remaining 30 percent is
provided through gifts from alumni, non-alumni, corpo-
rations and foundations, endowment income and revenue
from auxiliary enterprises. During the past academic year,
there were 20 Ford scholarship winners at Notre Dame —
the largest contingent in any school out of the total 265
Ford scholarship students enrolled in 63 private colleges
and universities.
Notre Dame must continue to receive corporate assist-
ance if current and future needs are met. On a quid
pro quo basis, industry ultimately will benefit from financial
aid given to education. Notre Dame will utilize corporate

The “Living Chairs” plan, established as a vital adjunct
of the Faculty Development Program, has already proven
to be an attractive method for increasing corporation
support. Many firms have contributed one-third of the
amount of the faculty member’s ‘mean salary’ within the
various professorial ranks. Explicitly, it is outlined as
follows: $2,400 is required for naming a professorship;
$2,000 for an associate professorship; $1,650 for an assist-
ant professorship; and $1,350 for an instructorship. These
figures are based on the knowledge that the student pays
about two-thirds of the cost necessary to educate him.
Industry and education have responsibilities to each
other and Notre Dame is hopeful of continued, generous
financial aid for the great task ahead of educating the
leaders of tomorrow.

PAPAL HONOR AWARDED
TO NEW YORK CATHOLICS,
ADVISORS TO NOTRE DAME
The title of Private Chamberlain has
been bestowed by Pope Pius XII on
four prominent Roman Catholics in
New York City, all of whom are active
on Notre Dame’s Lay Trustees and
Advisory Councils.
Those honored include John A.
Coleman, of the College of Commerce
Advisory Council; Frank M. Folsom,
of the Advisory Council for Science and
Engineering; Harry C. Haggerty, a
member of the Board of Lay Trustees
and also the Advisory Council for the
College of Arts and Letters; and Victor
D. Ziminsky, a member of the Advisory
Council for Commerce.
This is the first time since 1937 that
Roman Catholic laymen in the Arch-
diocese of New York have received
the honor, which dates from 1555.
Private Chamberlains are selected from
outstanding laity of all nations for their
special service to the Catholic Church.
The Notre Dame Alumni Club of
Detroit has pledged a $10,000 gift for
the new Moreau Seminary and has
already paid the first $2,500 install-
ment. Other payments, in equal
amounts, will be made over the next
three-year period. A plaque, appropri-
ately inscribed with the name of the
Detroit alumni organization, will be
erected in the building. This is the
largest gift thus far received from a
Notre Dame alumni group for the
Seminary Fund.
One of the pioneers in Notre Dame’s
global network of 166 alumni clubs,
Detroit’s annual program got under-
way in 1916. Under capable leader-
ship of officers and boards of directors,
the original program has been imple-
mented from time to time with varied
events. During the past year the activ-
ities schedule has included: a stu-
pendous Universal Notre Dame Night
dinner, featuring the presence of De-
troit’s most prominent leaders in busi-
ness and industry; weekend retreat;
Christmas Dance; Universal Com-
munion Breakfast; two trips to home
football games at Notre Dame; sum-
mer festival; golf outing; television
football party; and the fall ‘Friendly
Foes’ kickoff football party which also
honors Notre Dame students in the
area.
The Detroit club has been a generous
contributor to many University proj-
ects including the Nieuwland Science
Building; the Scholarship Fund; the
Faculty Development Program; and
the most recent pledge to the Moreau
Seminary campaign.

Department of Metallurgy
Is Studying Strength and
Durability of Metals, Using
The X-ray Diffractometer
by Dr. Bernard D. Cullity
Notre Dame’s Department of Metal-
lurgy is experimenting with a unique
and complex machine which may de-
termine answers to many industrial
problems concerning the use of alloys
and metals. Known as the X-ray dif-
fractometer the instrument measures
the methods by which metal crystals
reflect X-rays and it discloses valuable
information about the composition of
metal.
Strength and hardness, as well as
the other properties which combine to
make a metal useful, are revealed
through X-ray diffraction. This is an
important tool not only in basic re-
search on metals but in the con-
trol and improvement of manufactur-
ing operations.
Heat treating, welding, casting, forg-
O’	O’	O’ o
ing—-all have benefited from diffrac-
tion experiments and diffraction has
played a major role in the develop-
ment of all new alloys, including those
used in today’s jet engines.
Metallurgists have been using X-ray
diffraction for 40 years to peer into
the interior structure of metals. How-
ever, it was only recently that the pow-
erful and convenient diffractometer has
become of valued assistance. In meas-
uring the reflection angles, the diffrac-
tometer detects X-rays with a sensitive
geiger counter. The counter in turn
transmits an electrical signal to a pen
moving on a chart.
In X-ray diffraction a narrow beam
of X-rays strikes a piece of metal and
disintegrates into a number of
smaller beams. Since atoms in

other
piece
a
of metal are in parallel planes, these
atom planes reflect X-rays in much the
same way as a mirror reflects ordinary
light. A sort of “X-ray microscope” is
provided through diffraction, inas-
much as atoms are invisible under the
microscope and their position in a
metal crystal is calculated from the
angles at which X-rays are reflected.
The modern science of metals would
have been impossible without the fun-
damental knowledge of metal structure
provided by diffraction. One problem
being investigated at Notre Dame con-
cerns “grain-oriented” metal. The
Notre Dame investigators have de-
veloped a new method for determining
grain orientation in metal wires. This
method is being used to study the
changes which occur during the form-
ing and heat treating of wire. The
purpose of this work is to discover how
a particular property of the wire (i.e.
its strength) is affected by the way the
grains are oriented. Obviously the
ultimate result is to find a way to line
up these grains in the proper way so
as to produce maximum strength in
the metal.
Another project at Notre Dame in-
volves the study of alloys with the dif-
fractometer. Alloys are mixtures of
metals, and the alloy currently receiv-
ing the most attention is one of copper
and gold. Experiments are often con-
ducted at high temperatures—above
1000 degrees fahrenheit—as well as at
room temperature. There is much
scientific interest in this alloy, and ex-
periments on it may even point the
way to better alloys for gas turbine
engines.
The diffractometer consists of an
X-ray tube, an electrical detectoi'
mounted on a rotating circular plat-
form, and an electronic feed back
system from the detector to a graphical
recorder.
Although it has not made many in-
novations in X-ray diffraction, the dif- ;
fractometer has combined previous f
methods into one compact and con- j
venient instrument. The time saved by |
this device has made way for the prog- ।
ress of more metallurgical development. J
Todav, the diffractometer is a com- ■
mon instrument in any industry involv- i
ing the use of metals. Many univer- i
sities have acquired it for use in their j
laboratories.	’
The experience gained by the stu- [
dents studying metallurgy at Notre
Dame in operating this instrument has
proved invaluable to them when they i
have taken their place among metal-
lurgical engineers in industry.

Moot Court
LAWYERS by Michael Matthews
The author is a junior, majoring in
Journalism, and is from Kansas City,
Mo.
In seven years, the Notre Dame
Moot Court system developed from an
idea into a recognized, successful ex-
periment in legal education.
As of 1956, Moot Court contestants
from Notre Dame have won the re-
gional arguments in Chicago twice,
and have been runners-up once. They
appeared in the National Moot Court
Finals, New York City, in 1950 and
1951, and will go again this year.
The Moot Court was originated in
the fall semester of 1949, through the
joint efforts of Professors Robert E.
Sullivan and Edward F. Barrett, of the
Law Faculty, and Henry M. Shine, Jr.,
of Los Angeles, California. Shine, a
student here at the time, contacted
various law schools throughout the
country where the Moot Court system
was already in use, and obtained many
suggestions on the subject. The three
men adopted some of these ideas, added
their own thoughts, and organized
Notre Dame’s Moot Court.
The outstanding advantage of the
Court is that it provides practical ex-
perience for law students who are doing
legal research. Further, it provides
them the opportunity to become
familiar with the atmosphere and pro-
cedure of an appellate court.
The Moot Court deals exclusively
with appellate cases, that is, cases which
have been appealed. One team, com-
posed of two men, defends the decision
of a lower court on a case, while an-
other team argues to have that decision
reversed in favor of the person appeal-
ing the case. For instance, this year’s
case, a fairly typical one, concerned
the use of the plea of insanity as a
defense against the prosecution of a
man who was convicted of murdering
a federal agent. The actual argument
in court concerned the accuracy of the
tests which the courts used to deter-
mine insanity. The case had been ap-
pealed through the lower courts, and
in this final hearing was supposed to
be brought before the Supreme Court
of the United States.
The Notre Dame Moot Court is in
some ways different from that of other
law schools. Here, law freshmen are
required to argue at least one case in
the second semester. Also, work, in the
junior year, is optional. Professor Bar-
rett, appointed faculty advisor to the
Moot Court, by Dean Joseph O’Meara,
Jr., estimates that about 70-75% of
16
Notre Dame
the students continue to participate
even though it is voluntary.
Preliminary arguments start in the
fall, and continue until the end of the
school year. At this time, four juniors,
called “survivors,” remain. Until 1954,
these survivors competed in final argu-
ments held in June. However, three
years ago the time of the final hearings
was changed to the fall, so that the
law students could be present to wit-
ness the proceedings. This change also
gave contestants time to prepare briefs
on the national question, sent out by
the Association of the Bar of the City
of New York.
The region in which Notre Dame
competes includes Indiana, Illinois and
Wisconsin. Regional winners argue in
the National Moot Court Finals held
in New York City.
The argument of a case in the Moot
Court involves preparation of a written
brief, using the record from the lower
court, presentation of an oral argu-
ment, and answering any questions the
judges might propose. Cases in the
earlier competitions are usually in con-
junction with the work the student has
done in class.
Each team is allowed a total of 35
minutes speaking time in court, which
is divided equally so as to include op-
portunity for a supporting argument
and some time for a rebuttal of the
opposing counsel’s argument.
In selecting a winning team to rep-
resent Notre Dame in the Chicago
regionals, contestants need not be on
the same team to win. The two best
men, rather than the best team, are
chosen in every round. This elimi-
nates the possibility of a strong team-
mate pulling his weaker partner into
the finals and provides for keener
competition.
Two faculty members and one
senioi’ law student judge the earlier
preliminary competitions. Then in the
later rounds, two attorneys and one
faculty member sit on the bench. The
judges of the Appellate Court of the
State of Indiana render decisions on
the semi-final hearings.
Many prominent national and state
jurists have visited Notre Dame to hear
the final arguments. This year, the
Honorable John M. Harlan, Associate
Justice of the United States Supreme
Court, the Honorable Charles E. Whit-
taker, Judge of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and
the Honorable Charles J. McNamee,
Judge of the United States District
Court for the Northern District of
Ohio, judged the final competition. In
past years, Associate Justice Tom Clark
of the United States Supreme Court and
the Chief Justices of the State Supreme
Courts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Mich-
igan, Illinois, and Indiana have been
O>	3
on campus for this event.
The winners of the Notre Dame
Moot Court hearings receive the
Dean’s Award, established by Clarence
E. Manion, former Dean of the Law
School. Also, each of the two winning
finalists will be given a $50.00 cash
award, and the other two finalists each
receive $25.00. These prizes are do-
nated by the Notre Dame Law Asso-
ciation.
But whether the Notre Dame student
achieves a trophy in National Moot
Court competition is mostly of relative
importance—the principal point in
favor of its competitive and practical
aspects is that it is an extremely bene-
ficial courtroom exercise in preparing
students for the practice of law.
The oldest Catholic law school in the United States is on the Notre Dame campus. The present structure (above) was built in 1930.

The ground-breaking ceremony for
the new Moreau Seminary was held on
May 13. Very Rev. Theodore J.
Mehling, C.S.C., provincial of the Indi-
ana province, turned the first spade of
dirt for the $3,000,000 structure. Pres-
ent plans indicate that the building
will be completed by the fall of 1958,
providing living quarters, classrooms
and a gymnasium for 200 seminarians.
It is to be located on the northeast
section of the Notre Dame campus,
overlooking St. Joseph Lake.
Salina Alumni Give $1,000
Many Notre Dame men have al-
ready contributed to the new Seminary
through the 15 th Annual Alumni
Fund. Numerous non-alumni friends
of the University and various N. D.
Alumni Clubs have also made substan-
tial donations to the project. The
Notre Dame Club of Detroit has
pledged $10,000 and paid the first
installment of $2,500; and the Notre
Dame Club of Salina, Kansas, con-
tributed $1,000 in honor of Rev. Cletus
S. Bachofer, C.S.C., associate professor
of Biology.
Many contributions have been re-
ceived from alumni and non-alumni
for living and deceased Holy Cross
priests including Rev. Thomas Steiner,
C.S.C., retired Provincial of the Indi-
ana Province and former Dean of Engi-
neering; Rev. Leo R. Ward, C.S.C.,
professor of Philosophy since 1928; a
$5,000 room in appreciation of Rev.
Harold Riley, C.S.C., Superior of Holy
Cross Seminary; and the late Rev.
Bernard Furstoss, C.S.C., former rector
of Badin Hall.
Recognition for Contributors
Donors have an opportunity of per-
sonalizing their gift to the Seminary
Fund in three ways: a Memorial, re-
quiring a minimum $500 gift and the
usual plaque recognition; as a Bene-
factor, stipulating a contribution of
$300 minimum and featuring the
donor’s name on a wall plaque in the
main foyer; and, as a Builder, which
includes a gift of $90 minimum and
the donor’s name inscribed in a leather-
bound book on display in the main
foyer.
There are various sections and parts
of the new building which cannot be
readily ‘memorialized’ such as boiler
rooms, wash basins and others. Con-
sequently, ‘memorial opportunities’
listed on this page are not fixed by
actual cost but are determined on the
basis of overall construction.

Notre Dame
I
<
i	The Notre Dame Foundation has
i announced a new “estate plan” which,
if adopted by persons of affluent
means, could result in tremendous
benefits to donors as well as the
University.
’	Essentially it would pertain to in-
]	dividuals whose principal	estates, at
;	the time of death, consist	of family-
>	owned corporations. The	plan calls
for bequeathing a major	portion of
tthe stock in trust to Notre Dame with
■ the income to be applied for any speci-
’ fic use deemed desirable by the Uni-
* versity. Further, the plan incorporates
a provision which permits the deced-
, ent’s heirs and business associates, or
' corporations concerned, to repurchase
1 or redeem the stock bequeathed at its
book value over a period specified by
the donor.
,	Under the plan, many tax advan-
tages are created:
1.	Since the bequest would be con-
sidered a charitable contribution,
there would be a savings on estate
taxes, which in a good many
cases would be substantial;
2.	As the named trustees would be
members of the deceased’s family,
or his business associates, manage-
ment of the corporation would not
be disrupted but would continue
on a friendly basis;
3.	It would be unnecessary to have a
forced sale of a business or some
of its valuable assets to raise funds
for estate taxes as sometimes
happens;
4.	The heirs, or business associates,
'	could reacquire complete owner-
।	ship of the corporation at no out
:	of pocket expense to themselves, or
!	at worst by paying a bargain price.
;	In the following examples which il-
I lustrate the possible tax savings, the
1	first is predicated upon a decedent hav-
!	ing a surviving spouse which would
I result in full credit being taken for the
marital deduction, while the other il-
lustrates a decedent without surviving
y spouse whose estate would be unable
to claim the marital deduction.
Estate Planning
Example 1
Gross Estate ..............$2,500,000
Less Administration
Expenses .............  20,000
Adjusted Gross Estate $2,480,000
Less Marital Deduction
Allowed ------------- 1,240,000
Less Exemption .......—	60,000
Net Taxable Estate  $1,180,000
Federal Estate Tax  $ 395,900
This tax is computed on the current
rates such that the first $1,000,000 is
taxed $325,700 and the excess over
$1,000,000 is taxed at 39% or a total
of $70,200, making a total tax of
$395,900. With an additional deduction
for a contribution to Notre Dame based
on the corporation stock’s book value
of $500,000, the Federal Estate Tax
would be $208,700, or a net savings
of $187,200.
Example 2
Gross Estate __________$2,500,000
Less Administration
Expenses .............   20,000
Adjusted Gross Estate....$2,480,000
Less Exemption ........... 60,000
Net Taxable Estate.....$2,420,000
Federal Estate Tax .....$ 959,000
The above tax is again tabulated using
current rates such that the tax on the
first $2,000,000 is $753,200 and the
excess over $2,000,000 is taxed at 49%
or an additional $205,800, making a
total of $959,000. As in Example 1,
with an additional deduction for the
$500,000 contribution to Notre Dame,
the Federal Estate Tax is reduced to
$717,200, or a savings of $241,800.
Both examples are based on the fol-
lowing assumed and hypothetical facts:
1.	The decedent’s estate is valued at
$2,500,000 with $2,000,000 being
considered the real or fair market
value of the corporation stock;
2.	The decedent has executed a will
making a bequest to members of
his family or business associates as
trustees of one-half of this stock
for the benefit of the University of
Notre Dame;
3.	The book value of the stock is one-
half the real or fair market value,
or $1,000,000;
4.	Executor’s fees, attorney’s fees, and
other expenses other than death
taxes, are approximated at $20,000;
5.	The decedent’s heirs or business
associates also are stockholders in
the decedent’s closed corporation
or corporations.
In the above examples, the attorney
for the plan’s originator advises that
for purposes of taxation the bequest
would be valued at the corporation’s
book value since this is the figure which
the trustees under the plan would be
required to surrender the stock, either
on a repurchase by the decedent’s heirs
or associates, or redemption by the
corporations.
Under the terms of the plan, though
the heirs and business associates of the
decedent would have a right to re-
purchase, they would in all probability
choose to have the corporation redeem
the stock if sufficient surplus were
available. If this were done, the origi-
nator’s attorney advises they should in
effect regain the full ownership of the
company at no additional cost to them-
selves either in taxes or otherwise.
The University has been further ad-
vised by the originator’s attorney that
it is possible that the Internal Revenue
Service at the proper time might con-
tend that the redemption of the stock
by the corporation was comparable to
the receiving of a dividend by the Uni-
versity or by the remaining stock-
holders. However, the originator’s at-
torney advises that any possible detri-
ment is far outweighed by the plan’s
advantages. In the event the Internal
Revenue Service were to contend that
the University received a dividend,
this would have no tax consequences at
all, since the University is a tax exempt
organization. In the event the Internal
Revenue Service should contend that
the surviving stockholders had received
a dividend, it would at worst result in
the surviving stockholders regaining the
full ownership of the corporation at a
bargain purchase; that is, they would
be repurchasing full ownership of the
corporation at a figure which would
equal their individual income taxes on
the constructive dividend received,
which figure in most cases would be a
great deal less than the fair market
value of the stock received. In addi-
tion, their own tax basis for purposes
of a future resale would be increased
by the amount of the constructive divi-
dend, which, in the event of a future
resale, would save additional taxes.
