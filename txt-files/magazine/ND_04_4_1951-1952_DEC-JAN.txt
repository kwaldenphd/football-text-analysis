How About the 5%?
Dean McCarthy Writes About “the Five Per Cent” as It Applies to
Tax Deduction of Corporations for Educational Purposes
By James E. McCarthy
The executives of many American
business corporations are coming
more and more to realize that they are
being presented with a grand oppor-
tunity to prevent the encroachment of
the federal government upon still an-
other field of activity—a field of activ-
ity which has hitherto been quite de-
centralized. This is the field of higher
education. The clamor for federal aid
to colleges and universities has been
mounting steadily in recent months
and years, and the constantly increas-
ing pressure upon Congress to come to
the assistance of higher education
probably cannot long be withstood.
That the financial plight of a great
number of colleges and universities is
desperate is a fact well known. Al-
though many institutions have long
spent more money per student than
the student has paid in tuition and
fees—bridging the gap by drawing
upon every possible source of miscel-
laneous revenue and even using en-
dowment funds—the skyrocketing costs
of operation of the past decade have
made it the more difficult for them to
remain solvent. On the one side, the
mounting costs have had to be met—
but on the other, it has been impos-
sible to raise tuition charges and fees
commensurately — impossible, that is,
unless a college education is to be
made prohibitively expensive for the
great mass of young men and women.
That the business corporations of
the country have a vital stake in high-
er education as it is at present organ-
ized is also a generally accepted fact;
indeed, it is a fact so largely taken for
granted that we are inclined to give it
little thought. Not only do such cor-
porations recruit a great number of
college graduates for their administra-
tive and technical personnel, but thev
also gain many direct benefits—often
substantial ones in the financial sense
—from the research and thinking that
Dean McCarthy
James E. McCarthy, Dean of the
College of Commerce at the Univer-
sity of Notre Dame, came to Notre
Dame in 1921 as Instructor in For-
eign Trade. He was appointed Dean
in 1923.
Recognized as one of the nation’s
top experts in the field of domestic
and foreign trade, Dean McCarthy
has been active in opposing such re-
strictions on business as a profits curb
and lower tariff rates. In 1931 he
urged strengthening of the United
States Merchant Marine, long before
a nation-wide move was inaugurated
for placing our Merchant Marine on
a basis superior to any in the world.
Dean McCarthy is in great demand
as a speaker and is considered an au-
thority on current business affairs. He
is a director of the Advertising Coun-
cil, a member of the Advertising Com-
mittee of the U. S. Chamber of
Commerce, a trustee in the Foundation
of Economic Education, and a mem-
ber of the Savings Bond Committee of
the Treasury Department.
go on in college classrooms, labora-
tories, libraries, and offices. Their
stake is in research and thinking that
remain unregimented—and they must,
therefore, fear that federal aid to
higher education may turn out in time
to be federal management of higher
education.
But there is a price which business
corporations must pay if they wish to
prevent federal encroachment—if they
wish to continue to enjoy the benefits
of the freedom of research and think-
ing which at present characterizes
American colleges and universities. If
free colleges and universities are to
survive, they must have money to over-
come the financial difficulties with
which they are now struggling; if the
money is not to come from the federal
government, it must come from other
sources. And much of it, presumably,
should come from business corpora-
tions. Much of it indeed, should come
wholeheartedly from business corpora-
tions, for as Beardsley Rumi and The-
odore Geiger have put the matter—
“A dollar wisely and soundly in-
vested in worthwhile educational,
scientific and welfare activities
comes back manyfold over the
longer term. Expenditures which
contribute to these ends are ne'-
ther an unnecessary burden nor a
tiresome obligation. Like invest-
ment in new plant and equipment,
they more than repay their cost in
the future and can be among the
most productive and remunerative
forms of business expenditure.”*
The amazing thing about corpora-
tion support for higher education is
that it need not be particularly expen-

sive. The financing of the deficits of
colleges and universities does not mean
a cost to the corporations equal to the
amount of the deficits. Far from it.
The reason for this paradoxical con-
clusion is that corporation contribu-
tions can be substantially offset by tax
savings. The federal revenue laws per-
mit business corporations, in comput-
ing net income subject to income taxes,
to deduct contributions for education-
al, scientific, and welfare purposes up
to five per cent of net income—a con-
cession which is extraordinarily im-
portant in these times when corpora-
tion tax rates are so very high, and
which becomes even more important
now that the Revenue Act of 1951 has
boosted the combined normal and sur-
tax rate to 52 per cent and has placed
the combined normal, surtax and ex-
cess profits rate at 82 per cent. Thus,
if a corporation with sufficient income
to put it well into the 52 per cent
brackets were to contribute, say $100,-
000, for educational purposes, the net
cost of its contribution would be only
$48,000, for the remaining $52,000
would have to be paid out anyway—to
the tax collector if not to the educa-
tional institution. Even more dramati-
cally, a corporation which finds some
of its income spilling over into the
excess-profits category could contrib-
ute, say $100,000, in the full realiza-
tion that it would thus be incurring a
cost of only $18,000!
Although corporations have been
permitted since 1936 to deduct con-
tributions made for educational, scien-
tific, and welfare purposes, they have
exercised the privilege only moderate-
ly/ Such deductions, for example,
amounted to only .41 per cent of net
income in 1936, to .46 per cent in
1939, and to .35 per cent in 1941. Be-
fore the war, however, the tax-saving
feature was not very significant, since
the corporation tax rates were quite
modest. But the leap in tax rates of
the war and postwar periods should
have changed the attitude of corpora-
tion managements much more than it
did. It is true that contributions
reached a high of 1.24 per cent of net
income in 1945, but they fell off to .84
per cent in 1946, and still further to
.70 per cent in 1948, the latest year
for which statistics are available.

good will and other benefits, as cited
above, corporation executives must of
necessity have in mind the fact that,
should they ignore the opportunity that
is offered them, they may well bs
called upon to foot the bill for the def-
icit in higher education anyway. For
if a program of federal aid to higher
education is launched, corporations
may be expected to bear much of the
burden via the tax-rpute — it hardly
needs to be argued that corporations
are the happy hunting ground for tax
gatherers when new programs of ex-
penditures are decided upon.
What is more, the legal aspects of
contributions by corporations appear
to offer little in the way of difficulties.
According to section 23 (q) (2) of
the internal revenue code, contribu-
tions up to five per cent of net income
may be deducted if made to corpora-
tions, trusts, community chests, funds
and foundations that are organized
and operate exclusively for religious,
charitable, scientific, literary, or edu-
cational purposes or for the prevention
of cruelty to children; and there is the
additional provision that no part of
the contributions may benefit private
shareholders of the recipient end no
substantial part may be used in car-
rying on propaganda, or otherwise
attempting, to influence legislation.
Under the state corporation laws, the
question sometimes arises as to wheth-
er directors can prove specific benefits
to their corporations when they spend
corporation funds for educational, sci-
entific, and welfare purposes; but, in
ordinary circumstances, it should not
be difficult for directors to justify such
expenditures. At least 22 states, in-
deed, have adopted laws which are
generous in interpreting what benefits
corporations making contributions; for
example, the New York law sanctions
expenditures for “activities conducive
to the betterment of social and eco-
nomic condition” without requiring a
proof of direct benefit to the corpora-
tion. It might be added, too, that in

Football Special
By Joe (reason
The Notre Dame Alumni Club, in
Louisville, Ky., annually sponsors a trip
to one of Notre Dame’s home games for
orphans from that city. It has developed
into an efficiently-run project. NOTRE
DAME takes pleasure in reprinting a
story from the Louisville Courier-Jour-
nal, with the permission of their editors,
about this yearly cpilgrimage’.
■
IT has been said that getting a col-
lege alumni group to pull together
on anything for long is only slightly
less difficult than moving the Rocky
Mountains into the south suburb of
Altoona, Pa. All of which tends to
make the Notre Dame Alumni Club
6 Notre Dame
of Kentucky more than somewhat un-
usual.
For that club, which, logically
enough, is composed of ex-Notre
Darners, undertakes—and succeeds in
staging—at least one major event an-
nually that requires the complete, 100-
proof cooperation of its 150 or so ac-
tive members. Once every fall the club
tacks a coach full of Louisville orphans
onto one of the special trains it runs
to a Notre Dame football game.
Now just setting up and getting a
special train of some 250 adults to and
from a football game is bad enough.
But adding 90 boys, ranging in age
from 8 to 15, to that crowd is enough
to make even good, strong men start
thinking of long rest cures at those re-
sorts where the walls all are padded
and where the bellhops wear white
coats and carry strait jackets as stand-
ard equipment.
Yet after five years of shepherding
orphans on a trip to South Bend, In-
diana, home camping ground of
the football-mighty Irish, the Notre
Darners don’t seem to be breaking
loose in the belfry. Few of them think
they’re Napoleon, and no more than
half a dozen claim to have perfected
perpetual-motion machines.
This year’s pilgrimage to Irish-land
was for that Notre Dame-Indiana
afternoon of'horror a couple of months
back. Although the game (Notre
Dame 48, Indiana 6) turned out to
be one of the most uneven contests
since they put Marie Antoinette in
against the guillotine, the trip was a
double-dipped success no matter how
you look at it. Not even one of the
250 cash customers or 90 house guests
was lost during the 21 hour-long round
trip.
That feat alone, football specials
being what they are, is roughly the
equivalent of dropping a crate of eggs
from the roof of the Woolworth Build-
ing without cracking a single shell.
Moreover, the day didn’t cost the
orphans a cent. Transportation, three
meals, a sideline ticket to the game,
programs, Notre Dame-colored tobog-
gans, a continuous round of entertain-
ment and plenty of fruit, sandwiches,
soft drinks, milk, ice cream and candy
—enough to bring a gleam to the eye
of any bicarbonate-of-soda maker —
all were thrown in free. Even pen-
nants and those ridiculously-expensive
lapel footballs were included. The cash
value of the trip and the many extras
for each boy easily was worth $50.
Maybe by now you’re wondering
how, unless the project is underwrit-
ten by some member who runs off
batches of $20 bills in his basement,
the Notre Dame Club can give away
so much for absolutely nothing and
.with no strings attached.
Well, the answer undoubtedly is or-
ganization, cooperation of all members
and plain hard work of a few. For in-
stance, the orphan trip is planned well
in advance of football season. The
alumni club president appointed a
committee and the wheels started
turning nearly six months before the
date of the safari.
First, tickets, which by a month be-
fore the game were harder to find than
fireplugs in the Sahara, were reserved
by the club president. Then he met
with Mack Haymaker, Louisville pas-
senger agent for the Pennsylvania
Railroad, and lined up the special
train for that date. That was back in
July. After that the orphanages were
notified and asked to pick 10 boys each
and to provide one supervisor for the
Finally, committee members made a
round of local business places and
asked if maybe they wouldn’t like to
contribute something in the way of
food for the boys. Most of them would
and did. The final roundup of stuff
seemed enough to feed a miniature
army. Actually, however, there was
just enough to keep the boys eating
from the time they left Louisville at
5 one morning until they arrived back
at 2 a.m. next day.
In reality, the most unusual feature
of the trip, as well as of the four pre-
ceding it, is the fact that it was non-
sectarian; in other words, not for
Catholic boys exclusively. Those who
rode the special came from two Catho-
lic homes (St. Thomas and St.
Joseph’s), two Protestant homes (Ma-
sonic and Protestant Orphans) and
from Ormsby Village and the Opti-
mist Boys Club.
This business of taking a ccach of
boys along on a trip to South Bend
may be new to the Notre Dame Club,
but conducting specials of one kind or
another to important Irish football
games is old stuff. The club, the larg-
ND Backfield Coach Bernie Crimmins, a native of Louisville, was a
great favorite with the boys.
est Notre Dame alumni group in the
land from a standpoint of continuous
activity, has been doing that since
1924 or thereabouts.
In those early days, Frank Bloemer,
Ray Kirchdorfer, the late Nic Bosler
and others would round up a big bunch
of stags, hop on the interurban car
bound for Indianapolis and from there
take another interurban on to South
Bend. That made a rough, three-day
trip, but, the love of a true Notre
Dame man for the school is little this
side of the boiling point. Some years
later the special-train idea was con-
ceived, and two or more such trips
have been staged for the last 12 or 15
years.
Since the trips grew into a big thing,
they have been open to the general
public. Alumni are given first crack
at the tickets reserved for a particular

Mines and Booby traps are important subjects in the

Army Reserve Officers Training pro-
gram in the fall semester of 1951. The
University of Notre Dame was one of
three Universities in the Midwest to
sponsor this program.
The Department of the Army has
assigned Lt. Colonel George M. Cook-
son as Professor of Military Science and

on troop duty and Civil Works assign-
ments. Other members of the detach-
ment are Captain William W. Bohn;
Captain Delvin O. Hostetler; M/Sgt.
Homer Clendenen; M/Sgt. Lawrence
Terry; SFC James Mattingly; Sgt.
John Moran.
Much interest has been shown by
faculty and students in the activities of
this newly organized unit. It is a grow-
ing unit and shows promise of equalling
the Navy and Air Force program in
stature. There were 155 students en-
rolled the first semester, and a prospect-
ive strength of approximately 200 is
anticipated for the second semester.
A number of factors may be respons-
ible for this increase but the course
offerings blend so well with subjects
taught by the College of Engineering
that this is probably the greatest con-
tributing factor. The subjects that are
taught provide a practical aspect in the
students training. Some of the subjects
are Military Roads and Airfields,
Bridge Design and Classification, Hand
Tools, Rigging, Demolitions, Maps and
Photomaps, Construction, Utilities and
Job Management.
In addition to the courses which
have to do with branch techniques
there are those which have to do with
matters relating to world conditions
and international crisis. Timely courses
are offered the student so that he may
discharge his basic duties and responsi-
bilities of citizenship as well as to de-
velop an informed group of potential
officers. Military Policy of the United
States, Psychological Warfare, Military
Problems of the United States, Com-
mand and Staff, and Intelligence all
play their part in forming an en-
lightened citizen-army.

HANDICAPPED CHILD
A Notre Dame Special Education Feature
Experts in Child Welfare Field Attend Special Lecture Series
Sponsored by Notre Dame Department of Education
By Janies W. Frick
WE are in the year 1548. Thomas
J. Wagner is eighteen today.
This is the day when Tom ceases to be
a human being. From now on, he is
just an animal to be caged like other
wild animals because he has a handi-
cap — a mental handicap. Some peo-
ple say that Tom is crazy and in this
day and age all crazy people are
treated like animals. They are thrown
into a dungeon where existence itself
depends on their physical prowess.
Maybe there are 80 other “animals”
in the cage with Tom. Twice a day
the guard tosses in a basket of stale
bread. You see, we can’t feed the an-
imals too much. It isn’t good for
them. If Tom is agile enough he may
be able to exist for ten years before he
dies of starvation or his friends tram-
ple him to death after that stale bread.
It’s a great life to look forward to . . .
a great future.
Or take the case of William J. Han-
son. He’s twelve on this, the twenty-
fifth of May, 1915. Bill would give
anything to play baseball with the
other kids but they say he “ain’t fit to
play with.” Three years ago he had
polio and it left him with a deformity
of his right leg. He gets around fairly
well but he can’t run as fast as the
other kids so they don’t want him on
their team. Bill has to be content with
standing on the side-lines watching the
East Side Eagles drub the North Side
Bears. He has a “great” future too.
Maybe not as bad as Tom’s in a way
but then, maybe the mental anxiety is
worse.
Recently a special series of lectures
called the University of Notre Dame
Handicapped Children’s Workshop,
sponsored by the Department of Edu-
cation at Notre Dame in conjunction
with the National and the Indiana So-
cieties for Crippled Children and
Adults was held on the campus and at
a nearby crippled children’s hospital.
Teachers, nurses and welfare workers
from all parts of the country were
brought together to study the prob-
lem of children barred from playing
baseball with other children because
of some physical handicap or shut up
in some asylum, like animals, because
of some mental deficiency. After all,
this is a progressive world. We’re not
in the year 1548, or even 1915.
Experts in the field of special educa-
tion were on hand to lecture on the
new methods of treating handicapped
children. Dr. Bernard J. Kohlbrenner,
head of Notre Dame’s Department of
Education and Coordinator of the
Workshop, explained that the primary
objective of the Workshop was to do
away with the idea that handicapped
children are a burden on society and
to establish a realization that with
proper guidance any child, regardless
of handicap, can become a useful cit-
izen.
Under the Directorship of Dr. Her-
schel Nisonger of Ohio State Univer-
sity, the Workshop members were
introduced to the problems involved
in dealing with handicapped children
and the methods of overcoming them
through a series of lectures and films.
For practical application of the sug-
gested methods, the group was taken
to the local hospital and summer camp
for handicapped children. There they
watched the broken little bodies being
o
woven into a coordinated unit, and
the tiny warped minds beginning to
grasp the meaning of playmates.
During the last quarter of a cen-
Dr. Kohlbrenner
tury much progress has been made in
the field of special education for han-
dicapped children. Among the early
leaders in the field was Dr. John J.
Lee, Dean of the Wayne University
Graduate School. Because of the im-
portance of fostering the cause of
special education, Dr. Lee and the
other staff members gave their time
freely to the Workshop. As a result
there were no tuition fees, but many
of those attending were sent on schol-
arships by the schools or groups they
represented.

Not Machines, but the Minds of Men, Shape the Company’s Research
University of Notre Dame trained
scientists have long been recognized by
the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours Com-
pany, and other leading organizations
of this type, as essential personnel on
their research staff. Officials of the
Du Pont Company kindly furnished
material for this picture layout.
Ideas formed in a man’s mind, which
has been trained and sharpened by edu-
cation and experience, are the basis of
successful research. Without the crea-
tive brain of the scientist and his asso-
ciates, all other research investment is
worthless. Realizing that these men
and women are its greatest research
assets, Du Pont painstakingly selects its
scientists. The picture above indicates
the formal education of 116 doctors of
philosophy at the Jackson Laboratory,
Deepwater Point, N. J., where one Du
Pont department carries on organic
chemical research. Each of these re-
search workers has completed at least
seven years of university training, in-
cluding three years of graduate work at

fered to anyone who cares to make the
ride.
Incidentally, while it’s referred to as
the Notre Dame Club of Kentucky,
most of the membership is in Louis-

graduates and former students from
such scattered points as Bardstown,
Paducah, Ashland, Owensboro, Leb-
anon, Elizabethtown, Carrollton and
Frankfort make the trip.
For the latest trip, the boys occu-
pied the first coach on the train, di-
rectly behind the engine. That coach
was for the boys only; no-man’s land,
in other words.
When the boys weren’t eating, they
were reading comics, playing bingo or
some of the other games in which win-
ners were awarded pen-and-pencil sets.
On the return trip their names were
dumped into a hat and a drawing was
made for a Notre Dame blanket. Jim
Brown of Masonic Home was the
winner.
Two meals on the trip were served
in the train diner. Besides, each boy
was given a bag of sandwiches, dough-
nuts, fruit and candy for lunch before
the game. But the three scheduled
meals were only part of it. As one 10-
year-old boy put it:
“I’ve had seven soft drinks, four
pints of milk, three sandwiches, a brick
of ice cream, two apples, an orange,
two bananas and a couple of candy
bars, but I think maybe I can force
down that doughnut.”
ND Debate Team in
Match Against Oxford
The University of Notre Dame de-
bate team competed against one of
the world’s outstanding collegiate de-
bating units recently when Coach
Leonard Sommer’s “Arguing Irish”
played host to the crack debating
unit from Oxford University (Eng-
land) in a non-decision debate.
The question argued in the inter-
national debate was “Whether or Not
We Should Outlaw Communism.”
The Oxford University team current-
ly is touring the United States stag-
ing a series of debates with leading
college and university debating teams
throughout the nation.
Ford Scholarship Winners
Five of a total of thirty-seven boys
who won scholarships under a unique
Scholarship Program for Sons and
Daughters of Ford Motor Company
Employees have elected to study at
the University of Notre Dame, ac-
cording to an announcement by the
Rev. Louis J. Thornton, C.S.C., Di-
rector of Admissions at Notre Dame.
Father Thornton said that accord-
ing to the terms of the Ford Scholar-
ship Program, which is administered
by the Ford Motor Company Fund,
all winners will receive full tuition
and customary academic fees at any
recognized college or university they
may choose. For scholarship winners
who choose a privately-endowed col-
lege or university, such as Notre
Dame, the Fund makes an additional
$500 annual grant to such schools for
each scholar in attendance, in recog-
nition of the fact that at privately-
endowed colleges and universities the
student’s tuition and fees do not cover
the entire cost of his education.
Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., president of Notre Dame, meets the Ford Com-
pany scholars, from left to right: James J. Cennane, Chester, Pa.; Robert G.
Nouhan, Detroit, Mich.; Philip C. Chinn, Royal Oak, Mich.; Father Cavanaugh;
Bernard J. LaLonde, Dearborn, Mich., and Forest E. Brown, Louisville, Ky.
Recipients of the four-year scholar-
ship were selected following nation-
wide competition among eligible chil-
dren of Ford Motor Company em-
ployees. To be eligible for scholar-
ships the students had to be in the
top third of their high school class
and take a competitive examination
given by the Educational Testing
Service, Princeton, N. J. Class stand-
ing, examination grades, extra-curric-
ular activities, and recommendations
from high school principals and senior
counselors were scored to determine
the winners.
The University of Notre Dame ac-
cepted a larger number of Ford
Scholarship winners than any other
college or university.
Before coming to the University of
Notre Dame, as a student, in 1917,
Father Cavanaugh was secretary to
Mr. Liebold who at that time was
private secretary to the late Henry
Ford.

Notre Dame
Joseph Conwell, of Greensburg, Pa.,
a junior in the College of Arts and Let-
ters at Notre Dame, was named nation-
al champion in the contest for an
oration entitled “If You Should Go To
Youngwood33. Conwell qualified for
national competition by winning the
Indiana state crown last Spring. He
was coached in the competition by Pro-
fessor William J. Eisen, Head of the
Department of Speech at Notre Dame.
Youngwood is a small town,
just down the road from West
Salem on U.S. highway 38. Like all
small towns, it has its general store,
tavern, and Post Office, around which
are clustered a number of gray frame
homes. Youngwood has its share of
good, hardworking citizens and its
portion of folks who “whoop it up” a
bit at night.
The older, retired gentlemen of the
community — Ben Brown, Jack Frank-
lin, and Old Bill Sundray, just to men-
tion a few — congregate each after-
noon on the porch of Zeke Gommin’s
Tavern, which is just across the road
from the Old McPherson Grocery
Store. Here, they talk of town gossip
and discuss the world’s problems. Why,
just the other day Old Bill Sundray
said — and most folks today agree with
him, “Countries ben lighten fer as
long as I can remember, and fer all I
knows they’ll be waren forever. It
seems that folks are naturally unhappy
if they ain’t got somethin’ to squabble
over. It’s ben getten so that the only
place a fella can find peace of mind is
in his grave.”
What is this peace that our friend
Bill Sundray believes can never be ob-
tained? It’s something more than the
absence of war. It’s a spirit of friend-
ship and cooperation that should exist
among all states, groups, and individu-
als; it is order — order among the
parts of the whole world organism.
As we know, mankind has never
permanently enjoyed this harmony so
earnestly desired. Why? Do individu-
als wish to fight and to kill? I think
not. There are few today who desire
war, but just as few who do not be-
lieve war is inevitable. In spite of this
overwhelming desire to end the hor-

fish, self-centered, think only of them-

Human beings are often loath to
admit that they act in purely sel-
fish fashion, in order to achieve as
high a degree of security and as
great a portion of power as pos-
sible. They and the societies they
lead wish to avoid the consequences

petition for, power, realizing that

it brings about human suffering
and misery, exploitation and death,
the whole gamut of wars and vio-
lence, slavery and oppression.
The effects of this apathy are mag-
nified monstrously when ordinary men
— like you and me — become political
leaders. Personal selfishness is trans-
formed into national selfishness; and
personal greed, into nationalistic ambi-
tions. It’s this selfish desire for position'
that brings failure at the peace table.
This is why mankind, since the begin-
ning of time, has been raped by war.
The last world war and today’s Ko-
rean crisis give true testimony of the
ghastliness of hostilities. Early in 1943,
many newspapers carried a picture of
two Filipino prisoners of war, standing
beside the wreckage of what was once
a home. One had had his eyes burned
out, and the other had his tongue bru-
tally cut from his mouth. After being
freed by the Japanese, one was to lead
the way, while the other was to do the
talking. This is one incident of one
war. Magnify it a million times and
still we would not visualize the awful
totality of war’s terror.

The Gobelin Tapestry, “Diana the Huntress,” was donated to Notre Dame by Mr. and Mrs. Harry Sugar, of Akron, O.
This tapestry was formerly in the Bendix collection and exhibited in the Wightman Memorial Art Galleries, at Notre Dame,
from 1933 to 1944. It was woven by Philip de Maecht and is signed with his monogram.

Handicapped Children
(Continued from page 10)
In order to educate handicapped
children a teacher must know the
problems involved and the newly de-
vised methods of treating these prob-
lems. Yet, segregation of the children
is not the aim. It is, in fact, definitely
discouraged. Most handicapped chil-
dren suffer from an inferiority complex
to begin with. They feel “different.”
Segregation only makes them worse.
The Workshop at Notre Dame at-
tempted to show the teachers how to
improve the educational program for
handicapped students in their schools.
The necessity of changing the atti-
tude toward the handicapped children
was brought to the public’s attention
through local newspaper accounts and
radio broadcasts of the Workshop.
Handicapped children are a burden
on society only if society makes them
so. There must be an effective orien-
tation program both for the children
and the general public if society is to
benefit from the handicapped.
Speaking of the Workshop and its
results, Dr. Kohlbrenner stated that
although this was Notre Dame’s first
venture into this field he hoped that
something specific in the way of tech-
nical training for teachers would come
out of it. No definite plans have been
made for next year; however, there is
every chance that a similar Workshop
will again be sponsored. Too little has
been done in the field of education
generally for the assistance of our
handicapped children, but progress
was made by the Workshop in Special
Education held at Notre Dame. If
given half a chance to fulfill their own
capabilities, these so-called handi-
capped children will contribute more
than their share toward making ours
a better society in which to live.

ATOMIC ENERGY.-
Protection Against Radiation
Important Research Program Undertaken by Notre Dame Priest-Scientist
By James W. Frick
Father Bachofer in
the lab of Radiation Biology attacks the problem of
‘protection’ through
study of virus.
Mr. Frick graduated from Notre
Dame in June, 1951, with a degree in
Business Administration. He served in
the U. S. Navy for four years during
World War II, and was attached to
the Marine Corps. Mr. Frick was em-
ployed as Correspondence Clerk for
Employment Security Commission in
North Carolina after being discharged
from the Armed Forces. As an under-
graduate at Notre Dame, he worked
in the Department of Public Informa-
tion office. Currently, he is on the
campus staff of the Notre Dame
Foundation.
' | n HE air-raid siren sounds. Enemy
J. planes approach. A bomb is
dropped — an atom bomb — dropped
on Chicago’s North Shore Drive in a
stiff south wind. Five seconds after
the blast, the familiar mushroom cloud
is seen perched jauntily in the sky.
Two hundred thousand people have
been killed by the blast outright; per-
haps another eight hundred thousand
will die sooner or later from exposure
to radiation — the radioactive sub-
stances released by the explosion. It
is this tragic picture that the words
“atomic energy” paint in the minds of
the vast majority of Americans. Few
people realize that a great number of
scientists are working on peace-time
application of this harnessed energy.
But whether' in peace or war, the use
of atomic energy presents a very im-
portant problem: protection against
radiation.
It is impossible to protect intelli-
gently against anything unless it is
known what to protect against. The
radioactivity generated by atomic en-
ergy is a very subtle hazard which is
even more dangerous than the destruc-
tion wrought by the bomb. Why? Be-

cause a person exposed to these rays
not only suffers radiation damage him-
self but also passes certain harmful
effects on to his progeny.
Control of or protection against
radioactivity would neutralize the
harmful effects of atomic energy
whether applied in war or peace. To-
ward this end a very humble priest-
scientist, Rev. C. S. Bachofer, c.s.c., is
working constantly in his laboratory
of Radiation Biology at the University
of Notre Dame. Father Bachofer re-
ceived his undergraduate education at
Notre Dame. Graduate work was done
at the Catholic University of America
and he received his doctorate from the
University of Chicago in 1948.
Many scientists around the country
are engaged in similar research be-
cause of its tremendous importance.
And the points of view from which the
problem is being attacked are about
as numerous as the number of scien-
tists working in the field. The singular
or contributing feature of Father
Bachofer’s work lies in his method of
attack — a logical progression from
the simple to the complex. He is using
the virus, which is the most simple,
elementary form of life, as his “guinea
pig.” And why the virus? Because its
biological simplicity makes it excellent
experimental material for explaining
exactly what happens when living sys-
tems arc exposed to radiations.
To the question, why did you start
in such research, Father Bachofer an-
swers, “My reasons for undertaking
such a project are an intense interest
in this important work. It presents a
challenge that we enjoy meeting. But,
what is more important, we must work
hard to come up with some method of
protection against high energy radia-
tions before atomic energy can be used
efficiently. We must train well-quali-
fied students in this field to carry on,
to devise a neutralizing good for each
destructive force unleashed. If and
when we discover a means of protec-
tion against radioactivity, it will not
only save countless lives from direct
radiation but it will also save poster-
ity from certain harmful effects of an-
cestral irradiation injury.”
The experimental work presently in
progress was first undertaken by Father
Bachofer at the Argonne National
Laboratory in Chicago, during 1949-
50. Father Bachofer was at Argonne
doing research work for the Atomic
Energy Commission. Considerable
time was spent developing techniques
whereby the viruses could be given
definite doses of radiation under care-
fully controlled conditions and the
effects of these high energy rays ac-
curately checked.
While working to interpret the ac-
tion of high energy radiation on these
viruses, Father Bachofer discovered
certain changes taking place in the
viruses after being “hit” with these
rays, which the other scientists at Ar-
gonne agreed should be investigated.
At this time, however, Father Bach-
ofer was recalled to the University of
Notre Dame to teach Radiation Biol-
ogy. Immediately, in his spare time,
he began setting up facilities compar-
able to those available at Argonne for
the irradiation of viruses with the view
of finishing the work. An X-ray ma-
chine with all attachments, a vacuum
chamber, Geiger counters and other
basic material for the handling of ra-
dioactive isotopes were procured. As
the research progresses additional ap-
paratus will be necessary. Concomi-
tant with setting up this equipment —
testing, calibrating and improving it,
and also improvising here and there —
Father Bachofer and his assistants
worked with the members of the Radi-
ation Chemisti'y Project here at Notre
Dame during the past year attempting
to shed light on the mechanisms in-
volved in the killing of viruses with
nuclear energy chiefly from high ener-
gy generators.
It is only by understanding what
(Continued on page 20)

(Continued from page 19)
vital processes, what inner workings
in the viruses have been disturbed,
damaged, destroyed or in some way
affected by a dose of radiation that it
is possible to eventually come up with
a method of protection. It can be
compared with the patient and the
doctor. No matter how bad a patient
feels, there is nothing the doctor can
do until first he learn what the cause
of the malady is. When these viruses
are hit with high energy radiation the
exact effect of the radiation on the
viruses must be determined before any
thought can be given to protective
measures. The better it is known what
to protect against, the more effective
should the protective measures prove
to be.
When the principles of protection
for the viruses have been established,
Father Bachofer and his research as-
sistants propose to test them on higher
forms of plant and animal fife for va-
lidity. From there it is just a step to
man.
When may we expect protection
from radiation? To this question Fa-
ther Bachofer answers, “To think that
a scientist pulls discoveries out of a
test tube is folly. Oh, it happens every
once in a while but usually it’s a long,
hard struggle. It may take years to
come up with adequate protection
against radiation damage. But the
spade work has been done and as long
as the research is continued there is a
good possibility and even probability
that effective protective agents will be
devised, and then our panicky fear at
the mention of atomic energy will give
way to a wholesome respect for its
power.”
How About 5 Per Cent
(Continued from page 5)
corporation giving has too often been
the fear of criticism rather than the
expectation of advancing specific in-
terests and making a positive contribu-
tion to the general welfare. Because
they have given haphazardly, corpora-
tions have often exerted little influence
upon the beneficiaries of their dona-
tions. But the number of corporations
having positive programs is constantly
growing. Thus the Ford Motor Com-
pany inaugurated this year a plan of
providing annually for children of its
employees 70 scholarships for full four-
year undergraduate courses in accred-
ited colleges and universities as chosen
by the beneficiaries themselves. A sig-
nificant feature of a Ford scholarship
is that it not only covers most of the
OUR MUTUAL ENDS
“Now speaking as a corpora-
tion executive, although not
officially as a representative of
the company with which I am
connected, I want to say em-
phatically that—in my opinion—
every American business has a
direct obligation to support the
free, independent, privately-
endowed colleges and universi-
ties of this country to the limit
of its financial ability and legal
authority. And unless it recog-
nizes and meets this obligation,
I do not believe it is properly
protecting the long-range inter-
ests of its stockholders, its em-
ployees and its customers.”
From a speech by Mr. Irving
S. Olds, Chairman of the Board,
United States Steel Corporation,
Oct. 19, 1951.

tuition and living expenses of the stu-
dent but also includes an additional
grant of $500 per year to the educa-
tional institution selected by the stu-
dent if it is a private one—this in rec-
ognition of the fact, mentioned above,
that present tuition charges and fees
are not enough to cover the costs of
education per student. Sears, Roebuck
and Company annually finances near-
ly a hundred undergraduate scholar-
ships for students in land-grant col-
leges who plan to make agriculture
their life’s work. The Bulova Watch
Company has established and supports
a vocational school for training dis-
abled veterans in watch repairing. And
many distinguished corporations — in-
cluding the Aluminum Company of
America, the American Tobacco Com-
pany, the Proctor and Gamble Com-
pany, the Standard Oil Company of
Indiana, the United States Steel Cor-
poration, and the Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation—have contributed to
the atomic research program of the
University of Chicago.
One final aspect of corporation con-
tributions remains to be mentioned,
namely, urgency. The urgency of need
of institutions of higher learning has
already been indicated, but there is
20
Notre Dame
also urgency in having corporation
managements come to a decision as to
the nature and dollar value of their
objectives. The matter is urgent be-
cause contributions are deductible only
if expended within the taxable year,
or, at most, within two and a half
months after the close of the taxable
year if authorized within the taxable
year. Contributions cannot be carried
forward or backward to reduce the tax
liability of other years. Thus little time
remains in 1951 for the executives of
calendar-year corporations to decide
what they are going to do—yet great
care in the formulation and execution
of plans is necessary for wise giving.
Nevertheless, care in giving and speed
in giving can be reconciled. Messrs.
Rumi and Geiger, in the pamphlet
cited above, suggest that corporations
which want to establish sound pro-
grams of contributions individually
set-up tax-free corporations for educa-
tional, scientific, and welfare purposes,
make their contributions to them, and
then permit them — taking as much
time as may be necessary — to work
out their plans of “wise-giving.”
If You Should Go
To Youngwood
(Continued from Page 15)
Must this continue? Is war inevit-
able? I think not. I say that Old Bill
Sundray, and the other folks in Young-
wood, and those who agree with them,
are wrong. Peace is not a myth, nor
an optimist’s dream. Peace can be
permanent.
The first step to world peace is
moral reform. It will be reached when
individuals realize that they are social
beings, and have obligations, not only
to respect the rights of others, but to
work together for the common good,
to strive for harmony and order, for a
society in which a person can raise his
children without the ominous cloud of
war hovering over them.
The means to this moral reform is
not something new or unique. This
standard of righteousness transcending
the beliefs of all men, this norm of
morality that can penetrate the na-
tionalistic spirit standing like a great
wall across the road to peace, this com-
mon denominator of moral thinking is
the Golden Rule. If men live the
Golden Rule with all its implications,
our chances for a peaceful world are
much stronger.
Now, the second step — World Gov-
ernment. Since peace is nothing more
than order, and order implies working
together, a harmonious world govern-
ment is essential to the cause of peace.
You and I know this, and Bill Sundray
and the boys would know it too, if
they would stop to think.
Perhaps there are those among us
who do not believe in world govern-
ment, because it has failed in the past.
World government will always fail as
long as nations are permitted to retain
their sovereignty and to disregard the
rights of other countries. An effective
world society means that nations will
be bound together, not by treaties —
which merely unite the selfish interest
of countries -—• but by laws, laws that
will fuse these separate states into one.
Robert Humber, on the Town Meet-
ing of the Air, defined the need for
world government in establishing
peace, when he said,
There is no peace without jus-
tice, no justice without law, no law
without government. We are trying
to do something today that is im-
possible of achievement — to gov-
ern a world community without
government. It cannot be done.
Anything short of government does
not produce law. Anything short of
law does not produce peace.
The third and final step on the road
to peace is effort — effort on the part
of all men to live the Golden Rule, to
work for, and to believe in, World
Government. But, there is something
needed in our plan that would compel
men really to want to exert effort for
world government and moral reform.
What is this something lacking in our
plan? As I see it, wars have continued
to plague mankind because they ap-
peal to man’s selfish nature. If we
were rid of selfishness, we would be
far along the road to peace. But man’s
nature will not, cannot, be changed.
So, why not bring peace by making it
the object of man’s selfishness; that is,
impress upon each man — as it has
never, never been expressed before —
the terribleness of wars; the fact that
he has nothing to gain from them, save
misery and death, to see his loved ones
tortured and killed, to have his city left
a smoldering mass, and to observe his
life’s work spoiled.
We must begin the peace movement
— here— now — with ourselves, for
if peace is to be accomplished, the
movement must engulf all men. Only
when the weight of the Golden Rule
and the desire for a harmonious world
will be felt at Council Tables, only
then will peace be obtained. It re-
quires but one country to start a way
—• one man to pick a fight — but it
requires all nations and all men to
keep the peace.
If you should go to Youngwood, stop
by the porch of Zeke’s Tavern and tell
Old Bill Sundray and the rest of the
boys what we have discussed. You
know, Youngwood is just down the
road from West Salem, on U.S. High-
way 38.
Bishop O'Hara Elevated
To Metropolitan See
Most Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C.,
bishop of Buffalo, N. Y., and former
president of the University of Notre

of Philadelphia, Pa., by Pope Pius XII.
Archbishop John F. O’Hara, C.S.C.
The new archbishop was Notre
Dame’s 12th president, serving from
1934 through 1939, when he was
named military delegate to the
armed forces. He was dean of the
College of Commerce from 1920 to
1924. During his years at Notre
Dame, Bishop O’Hara founded the
University’s daily Religious Bulletin
and instituted a movement for the
exchange of students with South
American universities.

DEDICATED to the task of pre-
senting the best in prose and
poetry from student authors, the Jug-
gler “became of age” with their Sum-
mer issue, 1951. Don’t be misled,
however, because the Juggler actually
started publication quite a long time
ago. For more than thirty years, the
Juggler has been an outlet for student
literary talent. Sometimes the title has
been bounced back and forth with var-
ious and sundry names, but eventually
it returns to being called the Juggler.
Dave Yerex. a Notre Dame alumnus
in the Class of ’51, wrote outstanding
stories last year and helped to make
the Summer issue a great success. He
is now working on a novel in his native
New Zealand. Other student writers
showed remarkable insight and per-
ception as well as fine prose style.
Essays and book reviews, in the Jug-
gler, seemed at last to hit the epitome
of Journalistic excellence. Many as-
tute observers ventured the thought
that the Juggler, as of last Summer,
would rank as one of the leading col-
lege literary publications in the coun-
try.
Juggler writers have undertaken to
analyze such authors as Leon Bloy,
Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Aldous
Huxley with critical thought and in a
highly intelligent manner.
There has already been one issue
this Fall with another scheduled in
February'. The big edition will come
out in May carrying one hundred
pages of student literary gems. A
year’s subscription may be had for one
dollar and by writing direct to: The
Juggler, Office of Publications, Notre
Dame. Indiana.
The Juggler’s editorial staff-
men (I. to r.): Messrs.
Fraser, Ward and Engels,
prepare an edition for
early deadline.
