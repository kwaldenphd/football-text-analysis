The new Moreau Seminary, to be erected on the campus and scheduled
for completion in 1958, will accommodate 200 seminarians, many of
whom will devote their lives to Notre Dame. Story on pasje 6, this issue.

Dr. Ward Conducts Research Project
on Causes of the Common Cold
Late last November two unknown
viruses were shipped in a small re-
frigerated box from Notre Dame to
Maryland State Prison. Soon 32 con-
victs were absorbing these viruses into
their bodies on an experimental basis
so that medical men might have an
answer to one of nature’s worst dilem-
mas. The purpose: to discover the
possibility of another frontal attack on
the common cold.
Strategist of this new mobilization is
a man familiar with the complexities
of virus warfare., Dr. Thomas G. Ward,
now continuing the internationally
famous research at Notre Dame’s Lo-
bund Institute which he began at Johns
Hopkins University.
Dr. Ward was co-developer of APC
vaccine and, as he says, “It takes care
of five per cent of the colds we catch.
2 Notre Dame
We have 15 or 20 per cent under
control all told,” he quips, “so if you
could manage to catch only every fifth
cold, we could take care of you very
nicely.”
Two-thirds of his time here is de-
voted to increasing that controllable
percentage. Half of that is directed to
a study of upper respiratory diseases,
and the other half consists of work on
those diseases with Notre Dame’s germ-
o
free animals. The other third of his
time will be spent teaching in the new
graduate program recently organized in
Lobund Institute.
“We’ve only just begun to get things
underway,” he says. “We’re only ankle-
deep; it’ll take a few months more to
really get started. For one, we don’t
even know whether those germ-free
animals will be of any use to us against
the cold. A germ-free mouse is a
mouse, not a man—only men catch
colds. But at least our work will
answer some questions we’ve had about
germ-free life. It’ll determine whether
or not germ-free animals are virus-free.
(Golds are not caused by bacteria, but
by many different viruses.) My guess,
and it’s only a guess, it’s not based on
any research, is that they are not. That
would mean some viruses are con-
genital.
“The other thing we’ve got to find
o	o
out is exactly what viruses are. We
want to know how they penetrate cells.
Then we can determine how to stop
them and we’ll have them licked.”
This solution is more vital than most
people realize. Viruses cause scores of
diseases, among them some of the
scourges of mankind. Polio, mumps,
chicken-pox, influenza, brain fever,
smallpox, all are virus diseases. And,
though most Americans have passed
through a week or so of virus-called
measles without serious complications,
did you know that measles kill more
humans between the ages of one and
three than all other causes including

accidents? And did you know that if
a baby is bom blind and/or deaf
and/or with heart disease the chances
are nine to one that the mother had,
during the first three months of preg-
nancy, another virus-caused disease
known as German measles? (Char-
acteristically, Dr. Ward infected his
and his neighbors’ daughters with Ger-
man measles while they were children.)
But what about the 32 prisoners who
were inoculated with the two unknown
viruses? “Every once in a while,” says
the virologist, who was present for the
tests, “someone came in complaining of
a cold. I looked them over, and if it
seemed to me like an uncomplicated
cold I didn’t do a thing for them. In-
stead, I drew some blood after a nose
wash and told the patient to return
in 19 days. When he came back I
took additional blood and only then
did I give him some medication.
“The idea is this. In the nose wash
is the virus, in the blood are the anti-
bodies, the substances the body pro-
duces to protect itself from dangerous
‘bugs’ that have entered its system. If
the virus is one that we’ve never known
before, we grow it on some tissue. If it
destroys the tissue we dilute it 100 times
and put it on some more tissue; if it
kills the new tissue we do the same
thing again. If now, when it’s at one-
ten-thousandth of its original potency, it
still kills tissue, we know it’s virulent.
“We put some of it at full strength
with the second-day blood. (Assuming
the patient came in the day after he
caught his cold.) Nothing happens.
Then we put some full-strength virus
with the 21-day blood. If this blood
neutralizes the virus we know for sure
that there were anti-bodies produced
and that it’s worth investigating. We
run across something unknown like this
only once in about a hundred times.
“Bear this in mind. All we know
so far is that we have a ‘bug’ we’ve
never heard of before. We don’t know
whether he’s a cold ‘bug’ or not—
we’ve only guessed at that. And here’s
where the 32 men come in.
“We tested and kept two of these
virus cultures living on tissue in our
deep-freeze for a while. Finally we set
up the experiment with the prisoners,
all volunteers. (We’ve done the same
with about 1500 men during the last
seven years.) Most of them we shot
with one of the viruses, some with ster-
ile material. And here’s the strange
part. The psychologist and psychia-
trist who work with me say that, when
the results are in, many who didn’t get
a virus will have colds.
“This is a by-product of these ex-
periments which may prove more im-
portant than their original purpose.
First, psychological reasons may have
a lot to do with people catching colds,
and second, it seems that the disease
may help an ill-adjusted person accept
society by having him realize his de-
pendence on people for medication,
relief of pain, nourishment and cloth-
ing. The insane and the schizophrenic,
too, refuse to realize this relation. Dis-
ease seems to bring them closer to
reality.
“What we’ve done doesn’t even
begin to prove anything. But, if any
of this turns out to be true some time
in the future, it may give us an ap-
proach to experimental psychiatry.
That’ll be a lot better than the slow

study of virus diseases. He is a medical
doctor and head of Lobund’s new graduate
program.
system we have had to use of categor-
izing individual cases. In other words,
it’ll have tremendous significance.”
But the medical, and not the psy-
chiatric problems, are Dr. Ward’s
concern. “There’s no reason for a
serious common cold anymore. We still
can’t attack 80 to 85 per cent of the
viruses directly, but they don’t do much
damage by themselves. They do kill
cells, however, and the germs live on
the dead cells. But the sulfa and anti-
biotic drugs kill those germs no matter
what virus has prepared the way.
“APC vaccine protects against the
adeno-viruses which cause about five
per cent of our colds. The sulfana-
mides and anti-biotics neutralize about
ten per cent. You can see, the cold is
probably a mixture of diseases, and our
job here at Notre Dame is to discover
them and learn how to beat them one
by one. It won’t be an easy job; it’ll
probably take 20 years before medicine
is anywhere near controlling all of them
completely.”
He looks around at the machines and
test tubes and scrubbed white walls.
“We’re working hard, but you’ve got
to remember,” he smiles, “these ‘bugs’
are smart!”
About 5% of common colds are controlled
by APC vaccine. The Notre Dame scien-
tist thinks that colds result from viruses,
not bacteria.

C.S.C., is Notre Dame’s six-
teenth president.
people. How are we communicating
our heritage to the world today? So
often the face we present to- an embat-
tled world is a face that is seemingly
rich, and yet really poor in its utter
materialism, technological with all the
trappings of tractors and airplanes and
gadgets, and yet seemingly not to know
or speak of our rich spiritual traditions
of wisdom and justice and freedom. If
we are to stem the tide that threatens
half a world yet free, we should speak
to men’s hearts everywhere the message
that comes from the heart of our faith,
to give life and vigor to our world.
The Communists believe only and
fanatically in physical power and they
cannot pray for they have no God but
themselves. We as a nation can call
If communism were to be wiped
from the face of the earth today or
tomorrow we would not ourselves be
better than we are today, only perhaps
less harassed. And in the providence
of God, perhaps we are faced with
the present crisis in order that we might
assess more urgently those truths by
which we profess to live. This achieve-
ment alone, in truth and in reality,
would be the most effective kind of
deathblow to communism and its
claims.
The current world struggle is not just
democracy versus communism as two
opposing political orders, even less the
physical matter of the West against
the armed divisions of the totalitarian
regime, but two world views and two
views of man locked in mortal combat.
America must rediscover and reactivate
the faith that gave birth to our democ-
racy, and make this faith an active,
vital force in the world today if we are
to face this present scourge and con-
quer it, and indeed, if we are to grow
and survive independently of this
threat.
Religious faith offers much that will
strengthen our devotion to democracy
and the democratic idea. It tells us
first of all, and this is most vital, that
there is one supreme, personal God.
This acknowledgment of God is the
most important point of our differences
with communism which is evil, first and
foremost because it is atheistic, teaching
that there is no God.
The second object of our faith is man
who possesses dignity and even immor-
tality because God had created him
after His own image and likeness, a
person whose spiritual soul possesses
the godlike powers of knowing and
loving, a person endowed by God with
all those inalienable rights which are
necessary for him to act humanly, and
to fulfill his God-given destiny accord-
ing to his own enlightened conscience.
For the communists, man has no hope
beyond this earth, no rights except
those given by the state.
There are two corollaries to our faith
in God and man: our belief in an
objective moral order of good and evil
and our notion of government in which
we look upon the state as the agent to
serve man, the citizen, in the possession
and exercise of his basic human rights,
and to promote the good of all the
on a higher power. Indeed all our
other actions will be meaningless and
ultimately fruitless unless we do remain
true to the base of our tradition and
ask the all-powerful God to aid us in
our cause if it is right. The rightness
of this cause is the best presage of
eventual victory, if only we can labor
valiantly and courageously and with
the grace of God to make our heritage
alive in these evil days.
The conflict between democracy and
Communism is beyond the physical
forces of manpower, strategic bases,
and nuclear weapons—it is really a
battle for the souls of men. There is
reason for new hope today in the very
fact that all who profess religion in
America, Protestants, Catholics, Jews,
have begun to recognize a needed
strength in working together as God-
loving and God-fearing Americans,
standing together against those who
deny God, and destroy man who was
created in His image and likeness.

THERE’S NO ESCALATOR CLAUSE
FOR UNDERPAID TEACHERS
By George E. Sokolsky
Mr. Sokolsky’s syndicated column
appears in over 275 daily newspapers.
For many years he has been a loyal
friend and a generous benefactor of
Notre Dame. He graduated from
the School of Journalism, Columbia
University, in 1917 and since then has
been columnist, lectuier and editor of
several foreign newspapers. Mr. So-
kolsky was awarded an honorary
doctorate by the University of Notre
Dame in 1946. This magazine received
permission to reprint his column.
When taxes consume a large part of
everybody’s income and when the cost
of living rises steadily., certain elements
in the community find themselves
earning less and less in the purchasing
power of their take-home pay.
Some industrial contracts include
escalator clauses which protect the pur-
chasing power of the wage; such esca-
lator “cost-of-living” clauses rarely
appear in the salary scales of profes-
sionals.
However, those who have fixed in-
comes of any form, find this the value
of their income is constantly being
reduced. The same is true of white-
collar workers, as they are called, who
live on fixed salaries, salaries, some-
times determined by statutes which
limit pay not by a measure of the cost
of living for the particular type of
employee but by the will of a legis-
lative body.
With regard to teachers, I have
received many letters objecting to any
arithmetic which indicates that a
teacher is paid for 52 weeks work. Some
say that a teacher works only 40 weeks
a year but is paid for 52 weeks.
It is to be hoped that the critics are
wrong. A teacher, whether in the
kindergarten or a university, not only
teaches but has to learn.
Let me cite an example: A teacher
of physics, during the past decade, has
had to do a lot of study on the subject
of atomic fission so that he knows what
he is talking about in the classroom and
if the students ask questions. This re-
quires an enormous amount of techni-
cal reading which cannot be done as
one watches a movie show. It is neces-
sarily slow and laborious.
1957 is called the geophysical year.
Many important scientific develop-
ments are being brought into the news
MR. SOKOLSKY
about which students in high schools
and colleges ought to know more than
is casually reported in the press.
Often there is no additional pay for
the time put into intellectual tasks, and
yet without special work, the teacher
stagnates.
I have twice listened to President
Theodore Hesburgh, G.S.C., of Notre
Dame speak about the need for increas-
ing faculty salaries. It is not that
learned men have become more mer-
cenary in the present era than they
used to be in another age, but that the
cost of living, the cost of taxes, the cost
of books and magazines, the cost of
educating children—all these have gone
up for the learned man as well as for
the man who is not learned.

more than $10,000, depending upon

year trained PliD.’s, ranging from in-
structor to professor, run from a low of
$4,512 a year to a high of $9,384 a

the pay is still less.

the intellectual development of our
next generations to men who have to
dress like gentlemen and who have to

but whom we pay so little that they
must be concerned about how to make
ends meet.

community are driven down to the pro-

New Seminary for
Holy Cross Fathers
Present Inadequate Facilities for 105 Persons Necessitates
Construction of Building to House 200 Seminarians
A unique feature of the $3,000,000
Moreau Seminary, scheduled for com-
pletion in 1958, is the Benefactors’
Chapel where benefactors and their
intentions will be remembered in daily
Mass. For the first time in more than
a century the Holy Cross Fathers are
appealing- for direct fiinancial assist-
ance from alumni and other friends
in a nation-wide campaign.
Notre Dame has accepted one-third
of the total cost, or $1,000,000, of
building the new Seminary. The Uni-
versity has benefited, throughout the
years, from the services of priest-
teachers of Holy Cross. With addi-
tional vocations in the future, there
will be a greater number of Holy Cross
Fathers available for the students who
will be the Notre Dame Men of
tomorrow.
Since Notre Dame depends on the
services of priest-teachers of Holy
Gross, the University’s participation in
the Seminary campaign will be con-
sidered a part of the current Faculty
Development Program. Initiated by
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C.,
president, in 1953, there has been a
great interest manifested by alumni and
non-alumni friends regarding this im-
portant educational work. Besides the
individual contributions received, cor-
porations and foundations have gener-
ously donated and substantially under-
written the Distinguished Professors
Program which is another facet of the
overall plan as originally announced
by Father Hesburgh.
As so aptly described by Rev. Theo-
dore J. Mehling, C.S.G., Provincial of
the Holy Cross Priests’ Indiana Prov-
ince, “. . . we must build a new semi-
nary immediately—for it is our very
lifeline . . .” The Seminary has been
the “lifeline” for training priests to
teach and administer at Notre Dame,
to serve on high school and other col-
lege faculties, to work in the home and
foreign missions and to minister to the
faithful in numerous parishes where
Holy Cross Fathers are assigned.
The constructing of a new Moreau
Seminary is the only solution to a criti-
cal problem. Restricted living quar-
ters, outdated equipment and overall
inadequate facilities forcefully drama-
tize the plight of 105 seminarians now
studying for Holy Orders at Notre
Dame. The need to build has become
urgent due to the providential increase
in vocations to the Holy Cross Fathers
in recent years, a trend that fore-
Costing $3,0’00,000, the Seminary will be completed in 1958.

shadows substantial yearly growth for
the foreseeable future. Other than
those directly concerned with educating
these Men of God, few people know
that the present Moreau Seminary was
erected in 1920 to house 75 seminari-
ans. Plans have been made for
accommodating about 200 future
priests in the new building.
It requires much time and substan-
tial monetary aid to prepare candi-
dates for the priesthood. Before a
Holy Cross Father is ordained he
spends from 10 to 14 years studying
and it costs not less than $15,000—
most of the latter has to be underwrit-
ten by the Congregation.
Moreau Seminary, named for the
founder of the Congregation, Rev.
Basil Moreau, C.S.C., will be func-
tionally designed to include a main
chapel and six private memorial
chapels, a dining room and kitchen,
modem classrooms and a library, a
lecture hall and a gymnasium. An
85-foot aluminum cross, to be placed
in front of the main chapel, will com-
plement the Golden Dome and Sacred
Heart spire across the lake.
Benefactors will have the opportu-
nity of providing memorials to honor
relatives and friends, living or deceased,
and for special intentions. When feas-
ible an attractive plaque, appropriately
inscribed with the name of the person
being memorialized as well as the name
of the donor, will be attached to each
item for which a subscription is re-
ceived.
Construction will begin in the
Spring of 1957 with occupancy sched-
uled for the new building in Septem-
ber of next year. For the convenience
of contributors payments for memorials
may be extended over a period of 36
months involving four tax years.
Not only did the founding of Notre
Dame depend upon the Congregation
of Holy Cross, but its operation is due
to the generous service of Holy Cross
Priests and Brothers. Almost every
Holy Cross Priest has been educated,
in part at least, in Moreau Seminary
prior to studying theology in Wash-
ington, Rome, Paris and in other insti-
tutions.
The campaign is under the super-
vision of Rev. Alfred F. Mendez,
C.S.C., Director of Province Develop-
ment, and he is assisted by Rev. John
H. Wilson, C.S.C., Rev. John J. Lane,
C.S.C., and Rev. Joseph M. Rick,
C.S.C., assistant directors.
Rev. Theodore J. Mehling, C.S.C. (seated), Provincial of the Indiana Province, discusses
Seminary plans with (1. to r.) Rev. Alfred Mendez, C.S.C., Province Development Director,

By Donald P. Zeifang
“Doctor, how can you be both a
Catholic and a sociologist?”
Such was the question put to Dr.
John J. Kane, the head of Notre
Dame’s sociology department, at a
regional conference of sociologists a
few years ago. Dr. Kane, one of the
few Catholics who has gained promi-
nence in the field of sociology, believes
that this query reveals a feeling that is
not uncommon among his non-Catho-
lic colleagues. Many of them are of
the opinion that, in effect, sociology
and Catholicism just don’t mix. Their
attitude, though ill-founded, is under-
standable, mainly because there just
aren’t enough outstanding Catholic
sociologists in America to dispell the
myth. For example, Dr. Kane was
the only Catholic to serve on a com-
mittee of distinguished sociologists who
testified on school segregation in the
Topeka, Kansas court test a few years
ago.
Why aren’t there more Catholics in
sociology? Dr. Kane explains it this
way:
“In Catholic circles the subject
matter of Catholic sociologists is apt
to be considered almost anathema;
they themselves, whether priest, re-

ligious, or lay, are suspects. If soci-
ology is not confused with socialism,
it is certainly identified with secularism,
and an impression is created that all of
these matters might much better be
handled in philosophy. Yet the Holy
Father, well aware that social reform
is contingent upon an adequate system
of social science, has called for estab-
lishment of professorships of Christian
sociology at all institutions of higher
learning. When some Catholics have
recovered from the shock of discover-
ing the word ‘Christian’ linked with
sociology by the Holy Father himself,
they may be led to reconsider the
entire matter.
“Sociology is the scientific study of
group relationships but some sociolo-
gists make judgments on which Catho-
lics might disagree. However, these
judgments aren’t based upon sociology
itself, but come from the ad hoc phi-
losophy of these sociologists.”
So the real trouble seems to be that
Catholics in general just don’t know
what sociology’s special function is and
therefore can’t tell a sociologist from a
social philosopher.
Dr. Kane has been an outspoken
leader in the attempt to do away with
this Catholic disdain for sociology.
He’ll tell any listener just what a soci-
ologist should properly be concerned
with, and how Catholicism and soci-
ology complement each other. After
receiving his doctorate from the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania in 1950, Dr.
Kane became head of the sociology
department at Notre Dame in 1953. In
this position, he can and does exert
great influence not only upon those
enrolled in the sociology major, but
also upon the sociological field as a
whole. A popular lecturer and writer
for numerous periodicals, he is the
author of Catholic-Protestant Conflicts
in America and Marriage and the Fam-
ily: a Catholic Approach. Another
book on family relations, tentatively
called Building Up Your Marriage, is
due for release later this year.

Enrolled in Dr. Kane’s department
are about 70 undergraduate and 20
graduate students (both M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees are offered) under the
guidance of nine faculty members. Rev.
Raymond W. Murray, C.S.C., who
holds a doctorate from Catholic Uni-
versity, teaches on both the under-
graduate and graduate levels. Widely-
known and oft-quoted, Father Murray
is the author of Sociology for a Demo-
cratic Society, one of the more popu-
lar college sociological texts. Teaching
under the Distinguished Professors Pro-
gram is Rev. Joseph H. Fichter, S.J.
(Ph.D., Harvard), an expert on par-
ish social problems who has discussed
his specialty in two books—Southern
Parish and Social Relations in the
Urban Parish. Notre Dame is one of
the few universities in the United States
to have a doctor of medicine instruct-
ing in its sociology department: Dr.

chiatrist in northern Indiana, teaches

(Ph.D., Prague), and the Messrs. Don-
ald Barrett, John E. Hughes, Raymond
Grummel and Hugh O’Brien, re-
appointed head of the Correctional
Administration Program. He was di-
rector of the Indiana State Board of
Corrections for four years.
At Notre Dame, the department

group (as opposed to the group phe-
nomena of sociology), and anthropol-
ogy, which studies primitive cultures of
the present day as a guide to the study
of mankind. Included in this depart-
mental framework are such subjects as
American Social Institutions, the Com-
munity, Criminology, the Family and
Population Problems.
Two sociology clubs, one for under-
grads and the other for graduate stu-
dents, hear various speakers discuss
topics pertinent to their major. Field
trips to prisons, mental hospitals, and
housing projects are yearly highlights.
The Correctional Administration
Program, offered on the graduate
level, trains the student to entei’ the
fields of probation, parole, and cor-
rectional institution work. Aiding the
department in this regard is an advis-
ory board on correctional procedures,
composed of Thomas McHugh and
Russell Oswald, who are correctional
heads in the states of New York and
Massachusetts respectively, and Dr.
J. P. Shalloo, professor of sociology at
the University of Pennsylvania.
The planned activities of the depart-
ment are always expanding. A Con-
ference on Intergroup Relationships is
a proposed summer school project.
Available financial help will determine
whether or not a Symposium on Socio-
logical Values can be held annually at
Notre Dame. Indeed, money is the
deciding factor in a good many worth-
while projects which as yet have not
been able to get past the idea stage.
Of special concern to Dr. Kane is the
increasing percentage of Catholic
couples who are turning to non-
Catholic advisors for marriage coun-
seling. To remedy this situation, more
priests, especially young priests, must be
given training in this field. Some
scholarships have been generously pro-
vided by the university, but to meet the
increasing demands for marriage coun-
sellors, more outside financial assist-
ance is needed.
The ever-increasing importance and
influence of sociology presents a chal-
lenge to Catholicism. Laws advocat-
ing divorce, contraception, and eugenic
sterilization have come about to some
extent because of secular social phi-
losophies of certain American sociolo-
gists. Sociology shows what society
is; social philosophy shows what it
ought to be. Catholics must follow the
Pope’s lead: sociology should be
coupled with social philosophy to form
effective Catholic Action.
Dr. Kane lectures to students
in Sociology class.

Notre Dame President
Appointed as UN Delegate
—
least directly affect the present pos
session and development of atomic
power for destructive purposes. How-
Father Hesburgh, representing Vatican
City, speaks to the assembled delegates.
Dr. Morse (standing), alternate delegate,
observes as Father Hesburgh signs Statute.
At the conclusion of the significant
and historical “atoms-for-peace” con-
ference, held at United Nations Head-
quarters, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh,
C.S.C., president of Notre Dame,
signed the Statute of the new Inter-
o
national Atomic Energy Agency as
personal delegate of His Holiness Pope
Pius XII and representative of Vatican
City.
The precedent-shattering meeting of
40 nations was global in participation
while its effects may provide the basis
for a secure and lasting peace. In
speaking for the host nation, Chairman
Lewis L. Strauss of the United States
noted that “this is the largest confer-
ence of nations to be held since the
end of World War II, indeed perhaps
the largest in the entire history of inter-
national collaboration.”
Alternate delegate for Vatican City
was the famous mathematician, Dr.
H. Marston Morse, of the Institute for
Advanced Research at Princeton, N. J.
Dr. Morse received an honorary doc-
torate from the University of Notre
Dame at Commencement exercises in
1956.
In his remarks to the assembly,
Father Hesburgh said, “are we not, first
of all, agreed that control, as a notion
and as a reality, is an unpleasant, dif-
ficult and yet necessary fact of life?
Every standard and value we profess
is a control.”
Father Hesburgh continued, “more-
over, what we do here does not in the

ever—and this is highly important—
what we decide here in the matter of
control, generally accepted and re-
spected, may well indirectly lead to the
solution of the real source of anguish
o
in our world—the power of worldwide
destruction in the hands of human
beings capable of evil as well as of
good; and this capacity, unfortunately,
belongs to every human being.”
“The essential dimension of agree-
ment that really underlies the debate
may too often be focused on disagree-
ments. Sincere and intelligent men from
many distinguished delegations have elo-
quently expressed their convictions on
the details of control. Some want
minimum control, some maximum. But
all, I trust, will agree in these essentials
—that any control, however reason-
able, will only be as effective as we
make it, that the essential control is
yet to come, but that the pattern we
establish here may hasten its coming
and its effectiveness when it does
come, and that, ultimately we shall all
have in this world only that peace, only
that tranquility of order, which, under
God, we deserve and earn by our indi-
vidual and collective good will.”
In numerous messages the Holy
Father has discussed nuclear warfare
and measures to prevent it. The Pope
has stressed that nations must try to
avoid atomic warfare “through inter-
national understandings or else by
placing very clear and stringent limits
upon its use so that its effects may not
exceed the strict exigencies of defense.”

‘Outstanding Young Men’
Each year the United States Junior
Chamber of Commerce selects the
“Ten Outstanding Young Men,” be-
tween the ages of 21 and 35, who have
achieved distinction on a national level.
Chosen by a judging panel of nationally
prominent persons, two questions of
each candidate are considered: 1)
What outstanding contribution did the
nominee make to his work or profes-
sion? 2) What outstanding dedication
of service did the nominee make to
the general welfare of the people?
With the announcement that Dr.
Thomas A. Dooley has received one
of the ‘outstanding young men’ awards
in 1956, there has now been a total
of six University of Notre Dame alumni
who have merited the coveted honor.
The others and the years in which they
were selected are Elmei’ F. Layden,
1938; Dr. Charles A. Hufnagel, 1948;
Col. Francis Gabreski, 1951; Brig. Gen.
John P. Henebry, 1952; and Coach
Terry Brennan, 1954.
Dr.
Dr. Dooley, ’48, who received his
pre-medical education at Notre Dame
and his medical degree at St. Louis
University, is a 29-
year-old physician.
He formerly was a
lieutenant in the U.S.
Navy Medical Corps
and was cited for
demonstrating that
“medicine is the best
foreign policy weap-
on” in today’s world.
Under his leadership a small Navy
medical unit at Haiphong treated and
processed more than 600,000 Vietnam-
ese who were fleeing the advancing
Communists. Dr. Dooley recounts his
experiences in his book, Deliver Us
from Evil.
This year’s award winners were
guests at a banquet held at the Statler-
Hilton Hotel in Dallas on January
19th. Dr. Dooley currently is in Laos
working as a civilian physician among
the natives of that remote kingdom.
Brig. Gen. John P. Henebry, ’40,
recipient of the Jaycee Award in 1952,
has had a spectacular military career.
He was a famed pilot in the Pacific
during World War II and flew over
200 combat missions. As a member
of an air attack group in New Guinea
Henebry named his plane “Notre Dame
de Victoire.” He has
been awarded the
Distinguished Service
Cross, Legion of
Merit, Silver Star,
Air Medal and the
Purple Heart. He
had the distinction
of becoming the Air
Gen. Henebry Force’s youngest gen-
eral, at the age of 30, in February, 1948.
Henebry was given the Junior Cham-
ber honor for “his broad comprehen-
sion of military air transportation
problems and professional insight into
the potential of the airlift program
during the Korean War.”
Elmer F. Layden, ’25, was selected
as one of the TO Outstanding Young
Jar’ by the Junior
Chamber of Com-
merce in 1938. He
was a member of the
famed Four Horse-
men backfield at
Notre Dame and has
had a distinguished
career as football
coach and commis-
sioner of the Nation-
al Football League. During his un-
dergraduate days, Layden was named
on numerous All-American grid teams.
He was head coach at Duquesne Uni-
versity prior to accepting the same
position at Notre Dame in 1934. Lay-
den has a law degree and currently is
a business executive with a Chicago
firm.
Dr. Charles A. Hufnagel, ’37, was
0	3	3
chosen by the Junior Chamber in 1948
as one of the ‘top ten young men in
Dr. Hufnagel
the U. S.’ Dr. Huf-
nagel, a nationally-
recognized heart sur-
geon, received the
honor for his de-
velopment of a tech-
nique to repair the
aorta blood vessel
with a plastic tube
made of lucite and
for the establishment of artery banks
similar to blood banks. He was given
a doctor of medicine degree by
Harvard and later did surgical research
there. Through Dr. Hufnagel’s con-
tribution in heart surgery he has made
it possible for the congenital heart
patient to enjoy a useful and produc-
tive life. A member of the judging
panel was Dwight D. Eisenhower, then
president of Columbia University.
Col. Gabreski
Force at the
Colonel Francis S. Gabreski, ’42, was
cited for distinguished service to ‘the
people of America in World War II
and in Korea, help-
ing through his ef-
forts to protect
American principles
against totalitarian
aggression.’ He has
I been called one of
■ the greatest flying
5 aces in history. En-
listing in the Air
outbreak of WW II,
Gabreski served in the European zone
until he was shot down by the Nazis
and taken prisoner. During 10 months
of overseas combat he completed 166
ah' missions. After the war, Gabreski
was assistant to the vice-president of
Douglas Aircraft and chief of the
fighter test section at Wright-Patterson
Ah Force Base, Dayton, O.
Head Football Coach Terry Brennan,
’49, was selected as one of the nation’s
outstanding young men in 1954 for
“demonstrating that
youth need be no
bar to achievement
in any field of en-
deavor, particularly
in college football,
where pressures are
great.” As a half-
back at Notre Dame
Coach Brennan he was a fleet runner
and once zigzagged 97 yards through
the Army team on the opening kickoff.
Terry received a law degree from De-
Paul University and had an extremely
successful tenure as grid mentor of Mt.
Carmel High School, Chicago, before
returning to Notre Dame where he
was appointed freshmen coach. When
Frank Leahy resigned Brennan was
named to fill the position. In addition
to guiding the destinies of the Fight-
ing Irish eleven, Brennan served as
head coach of the East Squad in this
year’s East-West postseason game.

Architecture Students Study Processes
of Air Conditioning for Industrial and
Home Designing

Air conditioning’s come a long way
since Leonardo da Vinci built a water
driven ventilating fan for the boudoir
of his patron’s w’ife about 450 years
ago. In the Gateway Center group of
office buildings in Pittsburgh 4,500
tons of refrigeration and over 6,000 air
outlet units are used. In these installa-

tions, outdoor air is washed, filtered,
and humidified or dehumidified by
central station equipment to meet the
needs of the season. Relatively few’
large buildings are designed nowadays
w’ithout air conditioning. That’s why
students of architecture at Notre Dame
are required to take a year’s course in
it.
Mr. Michael DeCicco of the Engi-
o
neering College who conducts the
course says, “Air conditioning will be-
come as common as heating and
plumbing within 25 years.” His pre-
diction is borne out bv facts.
For years people said, “Air condi-
tioning is right around the comer,”
feeling that an industry with such
potentials would soon capture the pub-
lic imagination. The turn came during
World War II when the “luxury label”
gave way to an appreciation of its
practical use in factories. After the
cessation of hostilities in 1945, air con-
ditioning broke out of the development
era and its growth curve has pushed
rapidly upward ever since.
Why should this interest Notre
Dame’s architecture students? Because
provision for the installation of heating
and ventilating systems is an important
problem in building design.
For the first three months the stu-
dents devote themselves to the funda-
mentals of thermo-dynamic equations
of heat and cold, and of psychometrics
which is the temperature, humidity,
purity and movement of air. And they
also detail the workings of filters, win-
dow air conditioners and other modem
equipment, because it is in the area
of small air conditioning units that
the industry’s expansion has been great-
est. Today air conditioning is available
in packages. There are small units for
individual rooms, somewhat larger
units for shops and other compact
units that provide year-round comfort
for the entire home.
Then this basic knowledge is applied
to representative situations. First, each
makes a complete analysis of a heating
and air conditioning job. This is called
“estimating the requirements.” Second,
various types of systems are proposed.
Then, third, each goes through the
actual mechanics of blueprinting the
particular system chosen because of the
geographic location of the job and the
advantages of one system over the
other in different situations.
In order to see the influence of
varied factors in actual instances, the
class makes frequent inspection trips to
investigate the systems used by busi-
ness buildings and homes in the South
Bend area such as: the WSBT studios,

(Photo on right): Mr. DeCicco teaches a
required one-year course, in air-condition-
ing, for architecture majors.
Sears, Roebuck & Go., Borden’s ice
cream plant, the Tip-Top bakery and
Robertson’s department store. They
observe the type of installation and the
space required for each kind of equip-
ment.
Notre Dame has installed such equip-
ment on the campus including the
shopping center, several of the libraries
and classrooms and elsewhere. It will
be included in the new dining hall,
scheduled for completion in 1958.
Eventually perhaps all facilities except

result being an
evaporative cooling of as much as 20
to 30 degrees.
But it isn’t this distant though fasci-
nating information that concerns mod-
em America. Businessmen know that
respiratory diseases are the greatest
cause of absenteeism among employees.
They know such work losses cost them
millions of dollars a year and they’re
hoping that air conditioning will cor-
rect the situation.
The demand is for bigger and better
homes, offices and factories and for
air conditioning to make them more
comfortable and healthful. Notre Dame
is preparing its student architects to
meet that two-fold demand.
If air conditioning of entire cities
from a central plant are realized in
the future, it will probably be done by
the architects of tomorrow.

Writing Workshop
Two series of Workshops in Writing
will be held at Notre Dame from June
24 to July 12 and from July 15 to
August 2, according to an announce-
ment by Prof. Thomas J. Stritch, work-
shop director and head of the depart-
ment of journalism.
The sessions are designed primarily
for high school and college instructors
who, in addition to their teaching, are
asked to supervise school publications,
handle publicity or develop promo-
tional literature, Prof. Stritch said.
Several of the workshops, he pointed
out, are intended for the instructor
who wants to develop his own creativ-
ity and, in turn, stimulate a greater
interest in creative writing among his
students.
Workshops to be offered in the first
series, June 24 to July 12, include
“Teaching Students How to Write for
School Paper and Yearbook,” “De-
signing the School Paper and Year-
book,” “Teaching Writing,” “Planning
and Writing School Radio and Tele-
vision Scripts,” “Editorial and Critical
Writing,” “Writing Fiction,” and
“Writing and Teaching Poetry.”
Students may enroll for a limit of
two workshops in each series. One and
one-half credits will be awarded for
each workshop. Credits may be ap-
plied toward advanced degrees. Addi-
tional information may be obtained by

STUDENTS DONATE
DURING CAMPAIGN
More than 99.5% of Notre Dame
students living on the campus made
token contributions to then’ alma mater
during the third annual Student Foun-
dation Week, according to an an-
nouncement by chairman David Mann,
Wilmette, Ill., sophomore. This special
activity is sponsored by the Student
Senate in cooperation with the Hall
Presidents’ Council.
The student chairman stressed that
100% student participation rather than
a sizeable fund was the goal of the
annual event. He explained that the
students were encouraged to give only
a nominal amount, even a few pennies,
to the campaign.
In return for their contributions,
Mann said, students were presented
with one cubic inch of earth “from
beneath the Golden Dome.”
Student participation in the annual
Foundation Week has increased since
its establishment in 1954. The partici-
pation figure that year was 93 % and
98.4% of the students took part in last
year’s drive.

William Burns (left), former president of the Notre Dame Club of Philadelphia, presents a
check for $1,300 to John Dempsey, city chairman of the Notre Dame Foundation. The gift
of Philadelphia area alumni will underwrite an instructorship at the university under the
school’s “living chairs program.”
Philadelphia Alumni
Give Instructorship
The Notre Dame Club of Philadel-
phia has contributed $1,300 for an in-
structorship in the University’s “Living
Chairs” program, a plan for the cur-
rent advancement of Faculty Develop-
ment. In accepting the gift, Rev. John
J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., director of the
Notre Dame Foundation, stated that
this amount will pay approximately
one-third of an instructor’s salary for
the academic year. The “Living
Chairs” program enables corporations,
alumni clubs, individuals and founda-
tions to underwrite the deficit in the
faculty payroll as a result of tuition
fees covering only two-thirds of the
University’s budget.
Under the present projected salary
means in the four levels of teaching at
Notre Dame, the following- figures are
