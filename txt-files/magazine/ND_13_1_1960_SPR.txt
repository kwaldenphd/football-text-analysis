Largest Construction Project
in University's History
In 1958 when Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C.,
President, announced Notre Dame's new 10-year pro-
gram for $66.6 million an important segment of it was
a new library. Although plans have not been completed,
the University’s next major building fund-raising project
will be the construction of a new library estimated to
cost a minimum of $6,000,000. The need for a modern,
functional and larger building to house books as well
as to offer facilities for research and study was self-evident
to those planning Notre Dame’s long-range program.
And from the beginning of the then newly announced
decade plan, emphasis was placed on the urgency for
a new library.
The present structure which provides space for
thousands of books, rare collections and study facilities
was erected in 1917 when the enrollment totaled one-
fifth its present size. During the current school year there
are 6,350 students at Notre Dame. The rapid expansion
of the University and the increased size of faculty and
student body have outdistanced the resources of the
library in spite of various changes such as relocating the
art gallery in a specially designed section of O’Shaugh-
nessy Hall.
Alumni have been asked to raise a minimum of
$3,000,000 over a three-year period, with the re-

maining cost of at least an equal amount to be under-
written by non-alumni friends, foundations and corpora-
tions. With respect to this total amount Father Hesburgh
has indicated that thus far he personally has received
assurances of two gifts from anonymous donors totaling
$1,000,000 and $500,000 respectively.
This will be the largest construction project in the
University’s history and the first major building of the
1958-67 program in which financial aid from alumni
and other friends is being hopefully sought.
Father Hesburgh has named a committee of thirteen
administrators and faculty members, headed by Rev.
Philip S. Moore, C.S.G., Academic Assistant to the Pres-
ident, to correlate suggestions from the teaching staff for
the new building. Other members include Rev. Edmund
P. Joyce, C.S.C., Executive Vice-President; Rev. Chester
A. Soleta, C.S.C., Vice-President of Academic Affairs;
Rev. Paul Beichner, C.S.C., Dean of the Graduate
School; Victor A. Schaefer, Director of the University

Expansion and size of the curricula and the growth
in size of the student body have greatly increased the
demands on the Notre Dame Library. Today, over 1,700
undergraduate courses are taught at Notre Dame while
the number of graduate courses is 300. In the revision of
the curricula and the development of new programs of
study there has been a move away from the textbook-type
course and more emphasis placed on extensive reading in
the subject. Most courses depend tremendously on the
use of many books and therefore greater use is made of
the library than ever before.
The increase in the number of students, reorganiza-
tion of the graduate school and the offering of many
more courses leading to the doctorate, the establishment
of the Mediaeval Institute and the Maritain Center, the
growth of the Archives, the development of research,
the expanded publications in such fields as international
relations, all have combined to tax the library beyond
its present resources.
When Notre Dame’s scattered collections were first
gathered into a central library by Father Augustine
Lemonnier, President of the University in 1873,
NOTRE DAME	VOL. 13, NO. 1, SPRING, 1960

Indiana, under the Act of August 24, 1912.
there were approximately 20,000 volumes. In 1917 this
number had increased to 90,000 books.
To Father Lemmonier goes the credit for establishing
a “circulating library” from which students might borrow
books for supplementary reading. The lack of any refer-
ence texts for students prior to this time was partly be-
cause of the school’s ever-slim budget and partly due to
a strong belief by several teachers that the students who
mastered the contents of one textbook were doing better
than well.
Notre Dame’s treasured library acquired through
years of patient work was completely destroyed when fire
gutted the Main Building in 1879. Included in the loss
were practically all the University’s old letters, historical
documents and valuable manuscripts.
The present campus library houses 388,804 volumes
while an additional 138,800 volumes are in specialized
libraries of the various colleges and departments. An in-
crease of 30,000 books in the present building will cause
an acute overcrowded condition. The new library will
house up to a minimum of 1,500,000 volumes and it
will be planned so as to provide study space for about
half of the present student body.
Ellerbe and Company, St. Paul, Minn., who designed
O’Shaughnessy Hall of Liberal and Fine Arts, Keenan
Hall, Stanford Hall, North Dining Hall, and the
O’Shaughnessy Sculpture Studio is the architectural firm
chosen for the new library. Additional details of the
building’s description, cost of individually-sponsored
projects and the over-all plan will be revealed in the
near future.

library to replace the present struc-
ture which was erected in 1917 at a
time when our enrollment was less
than 2,000 students and there was no
graduate school.
Today we have grown to a total of
6,350 students, and 484 faculty mem-
bers, with a graduate school of some
26 departments and 700 students. It
is rather remarkable that the present
library has carried us through this sub-
stantial growth, particularly in view of
the expanded collection of books that
has multiplied many times over. We
now have over half a million volumes,
100,000 of which have been acquired
over the past five years. Only the
establishment of branch, departmental
libraries has temporarily alleviated the
space problem in the Main Library.
Vitally needed is a place where at
least half of our students can, at any
time, find a quiet and calm atmos-
phere, the necessary books, and a per-
vading spirit of study. A large library
with many open stack rooms for study,
and numerous carrels for graduate
students, would fill this need in a man-
ner both appropriate and long over-
due. A minimal estimate of adequate
size would be provisions for about 1^2
million to 2 million books.
A library that will house this many
students and faculty, and eventually
this many books, is not only a large
more, but this figure must await the
blueprints and estimate stage. One
thing that we can be sure of now is
that every year its construction is de-
layed it will cost more. More impor-
tant, we need it now.
In a recent discussion with our total
faculty I promised that we would do
everything possible to get into the
ground with the foundations during
1960. One cannot, of course, under-
take a project of this magnitude with-
out some reasonable provision for its
finances. This, I gather, is my prime
responsibility. I propose to meet it,
with the help of all constituents of the
Notre Dame family — Trustees, Coun-
we propose to raise at least, hopefully,
more than $3,000,000 from large do-
nations and $3,000,000 from our alum-
ni and friends in smaller, but very
plentiful, gifts. On the first front, I am
happy to announce that we already
have assurances from two presently
anonymous donors of magnificent ben-
efactions of one million dollars and a
half-million dollars respectively.
As to the second half of our needed
funds, I have the greatest confidence
that our alumni and other friends will
rally to raise, as quickly as possible,
the other $3,000,000 required for com-
pletion of the new library. I am sure
that the challenge of this great aca-
demic step forward will raise both the
percentage and amount received from
alumni.
Of necessity, alumni contributions
will take more time, but I am so cer-
tain they will be forthcoming, that if
we can be assured of at least $3,000,-
000 in large gifts in the months ahead
(one-half of which is already prom-
ised) , we shall begin building in 1960,

Notre Dame
Student Body
Scholarship Fund
by William E. Scheckler
The author is a senior pre-medical student and is from
Kenosha, Wisconsin.
“Then, when I had just about given up hope, your
letter concerning the scholarship arrived. That letter is
responsible for my being here today.”
The above is an excerpt from a thank-you note which
was written last fall by a student at the University of
Notre Dame, Class of 1963. He was and is the recipient
of a four-year scholarship from the Notre Dame Student
Body Scholarship Fund.
One obvious solution for qualified students needing
assistance concerns direct scholarship grants. The only
problem here is the lack of adequate scholarship resources
for those who want a Notre Dame education. Hundreds
of students who are accepted annually at Notre Dame
request scholarship assistance. But the University is able
to satisfy the requests of a relatively small number of
them. In one recent year, for example, about one-third
of the high school valedictorians who applied for admis-
sion were unable to come when they received no scholar-
ship aid.
Students, and their representatives in Student Gov-
ernment, were aware of this situation and on December
15, 1958, the following resolution was passed by the
Student Senate:
“The University of Notre Dame faces a problem
far too common in higher education today. This
matter is a lack of adequate, even minimal, scholar-
ship funds. Last spring, the Student Senate, acting as
the representative of the student body, recognized this
shortcoming and allocated $9,000 from Mardi Gras
carnival profits to the University, to be used for
scholarships. The purpose of this grant was to tan-
gibly demonstrate, to the University itself, to the
alumni and to the friends of Notre Dame, student
interest and concern in the problem. Every year this
University is unable to accept a great many worthy
applicants, some of whom are the top graduates of
leading high schools, because it does not have enough
scholarships to adequately aid them financially or to
compete with other colleges. Many fine students with-
in the University itself, find available funds insufficient
to help them to any great degree.
“Be it moved therefore, that the Student Senate
of the University of Notre Dame establish a per-
manent executive committee to be known as tire
Scholarship Fund Improvement Committee. Be it
further moved that the purpose of this Committee
shall be to . . . actively undertake any reasonable
program which can expand scholarship assistance at
the University of Notre Dame.”
In May of 1959, the Student Senate allocated an ad-
ditional $10,000 for the Student Body Scholarship Fund
and the goal for 1960 was $12,000. Most of this money
is used for direct grants to students with only a small
amount being set aside to establish a permanent fund
from which the interest will be used. About two-thirds
of the money goes to incoming freshmen in the form of
four-yeai' partial scholarships and one-third goes to up-
perclassmen. The money is administered by the Univer-
sity’s Scholarship Committee and is restricted only to
academically qualified students with financial need. Over
twenty students have already benefitted from the plan.
The Scholarship Fund Improvement Committee sup-
ports, promotes and publicizes this student activity. An ar-
ticle which emphasizes why scholarships are desirable and
necessary is presently being prepared by the Committee.
In addition the Committee has offered its assistance to
the Admissions Office and the Notre Dame Foundation in
encouraging the increase of scholarship aid at Notre
Dame. The Committee also makes a yearly recommenda-
tion to the Student Senate regarding the exact allocation
of Mardi Gras funds foi' scholarship purposes.
This is a success story of genuine student concern
about student problems, resulting in a scholarship aid
program of $31,000 in three years — initiated and con-
tinued by men “with a purpose” in the Notre Dame
Student Senate.

Members of the Student Senate Scholarship Fund Committee
are 1) Peter Boyle, Sharon, Pa.; 2) William Scheckler, Kenosha,
Wis., chairman; 3) Patrick W. Nee, Roslindale, Mass.; and
4) Richard S. Jalovec, Summit, Ill.

NOW: NEW TREATMENT
FOR MENTAL IM wr"''
lL^NESS
Two foremost magazines, U.S. News & World Report and
Fortune, have commented on Notre Dame's New Tax-
Free Life Income Plan
On Dec. 28, 1959, U.S. News & World Report printed a
story (pages 73-74) titled, “How To Increase Income By Giving
Money to Colleges” featuring the Notre Dame advertisement
depicted here and also a similar type ad prepared by Pomona
College.
The magazine states: “Ways to make money by giving it
away — or by giving away assets: That’s what universities are
explaining to wealthy contributors these days.
“Taxes are the key. Donors avoid the capital-gains tax,
get a charity deduction, and draw on income for life. That
income can be tax-free.
“It’s all perfectly legal.”
Fortune, in its January, 1960 (page 86) issue, editorialized
most favorably on Notre Dame’s “enterprise and candor” in pre-
senting the Tax-Free Life Income Plan to prospective donors.
The comments en toto are:
“Opposite the ads of Wall Street brokerage houses, the
University of Notre Dame bought space in a recent issue of
Barron's to compete in the business of handling other people’s
money. The University offered to those charitably disposed
toward it a ‘Tax-Free Life Income Plan.’ It works like this:
Your gift of securities or other property is sold by the University
without capital-gains tax and reinvested in tax-exempt bonds,
the income from which is paid tax-free for life to one or two
beneficiaries, one of whom may be you. Here are some of the
benefits of this plan resulting from your gift: (1) No capital-
gains tax on donated property. (2) Life-time tax-free income.
(3) An income-tax deduction in the year of the gift. (4) Savings
in estate and inheritance taxes. (5) Rewarding personal satisfac-
tion of a gift to Notre Dame, perpetuated in your living memorial
on the campus. Thus, through a judicious combination of
various provisions in the tax laws, the benefactor of the uni-
versity becomes his own beneficiary, and guarantees, so to speak,
the return of his bread upon the water.
“Some people might object to this mixture of charity and
fiscal prudence. Yet Notre Dame is only bringing out into the
open an opportunity that is offered by many charitable organiza-
tions in private letters to prospective donors. The present U.S.
tax structure makes it quite unrealistic for people to give (or
spend or save or invest — or make wills) without carefully
calculating the tax effects. The federal government, as a matter
of public policy, deliberately encourages private aid to educa-
tion; in the absence of tax-law stimulation for such gifts, the
demand for more public funds to education would increase.
Who loses by the arrangement that Notre Dame has presented
with enterprise and candor?”

Zke University of fiotre Dame’s
TAX-FREE LIFE INCOME PLAN
The University of Notre Dame will be the ultimate
beneficiary in a Tax-Free Life Income Contract of ap-
proximately three-quarters of a million dollars from a
generous non-alumnus donor who wishes to remain
anonymous at this time. Three additional contracts for
lesser amounts have been negotiated involving an alumnus
and two other non-alumni friends, respectively. One of
these materialized from prudent counseling offered by a
Notre Dame alumnus lawyer to his client.
The Tax-Free Life Income Plan is designed to im-
plement Notre Dame’s existing program of Estate Plan-
ning — gifts through wills and bequests, trusts, insurance
— which permits donors to benefit from liberal tax laws
established by the Federal Government for fostering aid
to higher education.
The following paragraphs will describe some of the
desirable features of Notre Dame’s Tax-Free Life Income
Plan.
We are fortunate to live in a country whose Govern-
ment recognizes the importance of private educational
institutions as a bulwark of our traditional freedom and
national welfare and encourages financial support of
these institutions by granting special tax benefits to per-
sons who aid them.
Today, the cost of a first-rate education is so high
that relatively few students can afford the entire bill.
To make sure that Notre Dame’s share of tomorrow’s
leaders are not denied the education they desire and
deserve, the University must turn to alumni and other
friends who sympathize with her aims and are willing to
help in her important objectives.
The Notre Dame Tax-Free Life Income Plan aids
the University while at the same time it secures many
substantial federally-approved tax benefits for the bene-
factor and his estate. Finally, the benefactor will experi-
ence the rewarding personal satisfaction resulting from a
charitable gift to one of our country’s outstanding insti-
tutions of higher learning.
This Plan has four Federal tax advantages as follows:
the donor is entitled to a deduction in computing
his Federal income tax to the extent of 30% of
his adjusted gross income for the year of the do-
nation based on the imputed value of the gift to
the University, thus reducing his Federal income
tax for that year;
as the University is a tax-exempt institution, it is able
to sell the appreciated property without incurring
a capital gains tax on the appreciation in value,
thereby preserving the full value of the property
for reinvestment in tax-free bonds;
since the investment by the University will be in
tax-exempt State or municipal obligations, the in-
terest income paid to the designated life beneficiary
or beneficiaries will be free from Federal income
tax; and
the taxable estate of a donor is reduced by the value
of the property donated.
The details of the Plan are simple and are governed
by a contract, the tax consequences of which have been
approved by the Internal Revenue Service of the Treasury
Department of the United States. According to the terms
of the contract, in consideration of the donor’s gift which
may be of cash, stocks, bonds, real estate, or other
property acceptable to the University, the University
agrees to sell the property and to reinvest the net pro-
ceeds from the sale (or invest the cash) in State or
municipal bonds which are exempt from Federal income
tax. The University further agrees to pay, as collected,
which usually will be twice a year, interest from the
bonds during the life of one or two persons designated
by the donor.
Upon the death of the person or persons designated,
the bonds become the property of the University.
The donor has the option of designating one or two
persons, one of whom may, but need not be himself. His
choice of other beneficiaries is not limited to relatives.
The sole limitation is that, ordinarily, each beneficiary
must be age 40 years or older. If either is under 40,
however, a nominal annual fee for management will
be charged.
The University is obligated to purchase only high
grade bonds. In choosing what bonds are to be pur-
chased, the University will carefully consider the advice
of the donor, but need not be governed by it. Normally,
investment will be in bonds having a maturity date later
than the life expectancy of the life beneficiary or bene-
ficiaries. In the event that bonds mature or are redeemed
prior to the death of the life beneficiary or beneficiaries,
the University will reinvest the proceeds in other tax-
exempt bonds. Similarly, the University reserves the
right to replace bonds as circumstances warrant. If the
State of the donor’s residence has an income tax, the
investment by the University usually will be in bonds
of that State so as to preclude State income tax on the
interest from the investment.
Except as noted previously, no management fee will
be charged by the University for the sale of the original
property donated, for the investment or reinvestment in
the tax-exempt bonds, or for the collection of interest
from such bonds. However, the actual costs incurred in
the initial sale of the donated property will reduce the
proceeds from such sale.

Notre Dame Council No. 1477, the first organized on
a college campus, overcame the problems associated with
transient membership and relatively inexperienced offi-
cers, survived two World Wars and the depression, and
this April will celebrate the Golden Anniversary of Co-
lumbianism at the University.
Commemorating the Council’s anniversary, the Su-
preme Board of Officers and Directors of the Knights of
Columbus will hold their spring business meeting at
Notre Dame on April 8-10. The Supreme Board, which
governs the more than one million Knights of Columbus,
consists of twenty-two men including the Supreme Offi-
cers and Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart.
From forty-one charter members, among whom was
His Eminence John Cardinal O’Hara, Council No. 1477
grew to become the largest college council and one of the
richest in the Order. It presently has over eleven hun-
dred members and has accumulated over $350,000 in its
building fund. In the foreseeable future the Council has
plans for erecting its own headquarters on campus.
During the early stages of World War II the Council
was placed in charge of selling War Stamps and Bonds
on campus. A large committee headed by Grand Knight
Jerry Killigrew, who was later killed in action, collected
thousands of dollars on this project. Moreover, in 1940
the Knights sponsored the “War Charity Carnival” which
raised nearly $5,000 for war relief. This was the proto-
type for Notre Dame’s now popular Mardi Gras festivi-
ties.
Following the war the Council re-located in Walsh
Hall and the major project for that year, as it has been
ever since, was the promotion of the Bengal Bouts. This
student boxing tournament annually nets up to $7,000
for the Holy Cross Missions in Bengal, East Pakistan.
And the planning of the event generally preoccupies up
to fifty Knights for more than four months of the year.
The Knights of Columbus are traditionally one of the
most active organizations on campus, and graduating
members carry the spirit with them. Last year, the vital-
ity of the campus Council was recognized when it re-
ceived the State Deputy Award — a plaque presented
annually to the most actively organized council in Indi-
ana. Some years ago a survey showed that nearly 90%
of the councils in the country had Notre Dame men in
their ranks. Five former members of the Notre Dame
Council, however, subsequently were elected to the Su-
preme Council. And currently, Notre Dame alumni John
T. Rocap of Indianapolis and C. Conroy Scoggins of
Houston, Texas, both former members of Council No.
1477, are on the Supreme Board.
Dedicated to the principles of the Order — Charity,
Unity, Fraternity and Patriotism — the year to year ac-
tivities of the Knights are numerous. The social program
involves smokers, a picnic and the K. of C. Ball. An
ushers club formed in the past decade is active at all
Sunday Masses in Sacred Heart Church on campus. A
few years ago, the Council was able to make a substantial
contribution to the Moreau Seminary Building Fund,
and this year the Knights donated the funds necessary to
complete payments on a bus used to transport Mexican
migrant farm workers to Sunday Mass. The Council reg-
ularly responds to appeals of this sort. In addition to
sponsoring basketball and bowling teams of their own,
the Knights also provide coaches for C.Y.O. basketball
teams in the South Bend area. And preceding all major
degree initiations the Catholic Activities Committee of
the Council holds a Communion Breakfast and provides
speakers who generally discuss some aspect of Golumbian-
ism and the role of the Catholic layman in the Church.
In the first fifty years the Notre Dame Council of the
Knights of Columbus has grown to become a solid organi-
zation in its own right and has proved itself an invaluable
asset to the University. Its activities and the men who
have passed through it have been a credit both to Colum-
bianism and to Notre Dame. At their Golden Anniver-
sary celebration the campus Knights will commemorate
the illustrious record of the past. But they will also be
planning for the future — for a Knights of Columbus
building at Notre Dame and for a record to match that
of the past.

by Dr. George N. Shuster
The author is a distinguished educator and served
as president of Hunter College, New York City, from
1940 until his retirement on Jan. 31, 1960. He received
the bachelor of arts and master of arts degrees from No-
tre Dame and a doctor of philosophy degree from Colum-
bia University. Dr. Shuster was formerly head of the
English Department at Notre Dame. He is a former
managing editor of Commonweal magazine and author
of many books (including The Catholic Spirit in Amer-
ica). On several occasions he was appointed to high
governmental posts by the Department of State, includ-
ing participation as a member of the American delegation
to the UNESCO conference in Paris, 1946, advisor to the
London Conference establishing the United Nations3
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizations, and
State Commissioner for Bavaria in 1950-51. In recogni-
tion of his outstanding service as president of Hunter
College, the Board of Higher Education of New York
City has announced the name of the institution’s new
$3,300,000 library - administration building as Shuster
Hall. 7'he following paragraphs are condensed from an
address given by Dr. Shuster in Chicago.
A mighty effort must be made to assure adequate
Catholic participation in the scholarly and creative intel-
lectual life of the nation. What should we do? Above
all what is the role of the parents in stimulating the child
to set forth on such a career? Solving it is not a matter
of good will in the ordinary sense. What is required is
hard discipline in the value of which one must have faith
from the outset. And the trouble is that one can seldom
tell in advance whether years of such discipline will pay
off in the end. I have seen more than enough failures
to realize that in this realm prophecy is all but futile.
What, then, can be done? Above all we must give
young people and their parents an accurate picture of
the scholarly life. It is first of all no longer true that
the professor is as poverty-stricken as the clerk in the
Canterbury Tales. When he has attained to a measure
of prestige, he can if he desires build a bar in the base-
ment, too. Of course he will not make as much money
as does a vice president of Sears, Roebuck. He does not
need that much. The years of apprenticeship are, it is
true, very hard — not as hard as they used to be, but
still trying in more ways than one. Yet it does not seem
to me that the amount of labor and privation exacted is
greater than that demanded of young physicians or law-
yers. One would also be gravely mistaken if one thought
that progress can be made in a scholarly pursuit unless
one is willing to expend the last ounce of intellectual
energy. I should not advise any young woman to marry
a fledgling scholar if she expects him to be home at a
quarter past five, ready for an evening of bridge or the
theater. I have worked as hard at this enterprise as any-
one, I suppose, and shall confess there were times when
my wife looked rather wistfully at my study cluttered with
books as if it were a kind of jail in which her husband
was inexplicably confined. Yet I shall add that professors
seem to me on the whole a rather unusually happy mar-
ried lot. A campus can, it is true, be a fence on which
there sit a row of gossiping cats, but it cannot compete
in this respect with a country club.
I pass on now to more important matters. Nothing
more fatuous is said of scholars than that they do not
talk a language everybody can understand. Who speaks
that kind of language if he has anything to say which is
not banal and commonplace? Certainly the Ten Com-
mandments are simple and straightforward, but Isaiah and
St. Paul are not. You cannot explain the quantum the-
ory to people who read nothing but the Police Gazette,
nor can you discuss Hamlet with those whose vocabulary
consists of almost enough words for baby talk. What this
variety of criticism means, if anything, is that scholars
constitute for linguistic reasons a caste. Of course they
do. Bach and Beethoven are sundered in like manner
from the songs one orders from a jukebox in the Greasy
Spoon. The scholar must be prepared to stand apart be-
cause only so can he stand face to face with the unknown.
He is like a diver plunging into deep waters, like a ma-
riner going out into uncharted seas. His vocabulary, in
which the findings of workers who went before him are
crystallized, is his lifeline of oxygen. Of course he could
be comfortable, placid, even amiable if he did not ven-
ture into the unknown. But why anyone should assume
that comfort and placidity are virtues in the kind of
world we inhabit is more than a little of a mystery to me.
Parents should therefore rejoice when a sign is given

“Player in, player in,” a sharp voice announces crisply.
From a quick look around the room it obviously is not
something concerned with athletics. Dials are set, con-
trols are positioned, discs are inverted and headpieces are
adjusted. The scene and sounds might even be described
by the unfamiliar casual observer as a Buck Rogers ‘play-
back.’ Actually, this is serious business and is all part of
the University’s new Modern Languages Laboratory.
Languages? Laboratory? The two terms together seem
like impossible misfits, but they’re not according to the
dictionary. Webster says a laboratory may be “any place
devoted to experimental study in science,” and that is ex-
actly what students do in the language lab. They learn
languages by experimenting with them, by alternately
recording their pronunciations of words onto a tape and
listening to playbacks of these recordings. Each student
is seated in a separate booth, equipped with headphones,
a microphone and a small magnetic tape recorder that is
geared to one central recorder and operated by the in-
structor. This machine may contain a lesson taped from
the textbook or a recording especially prepared by the
instructor. At a signal from him, the student sets the
tape in motion and flips the control button to “record.”
Through headphones he will hear a word or phrase of
the language followed by a pause to allow time to repeat
this message into the microphone. When he has finished
the exercise he turns the button to “play back” and listens
to the results of his efforts. By turning a lever to any of
the various numbers indicating the thirty individual
booths, the instructor may listen to a student’s work, and
by turning a button to “talk” he and the student may
converse back and forth via the “mike” and headpiece.
The lab contains five central tapes and by adjusting each

Produced by Gousino Incorporated, Toledo, Ohio, it fea-
tures self-threading, unbreakable tapes which are en-
closed in clear, plastic cartridges. Tapes will play con-
tinuously up to one hour and are ejected by simply sliding
them from the player.
The program in Modern Languages for the Notre
Dame student represents a rich cultural experience and
a broadening of his liberal knowledge,

d
one to a different section it is possible to instruct in five
■	different languages simultaneously!
„	Advantages? Well, there are several, according to
Dr. William J. Grupp, head of the Department of Mod-
I	ern Languages. In an ordinary language class, with each
j	student reciting, the individual is limited in the amount
J	of time available for him to participate during the nor-
I	mal class period. In the lab he has the opportunity of
“	working without interruption on a language for the en-
tire period. The personal touch is added by the close
contact of the instructor — so ‘close’ that the instructor
is virtually the private tutoi' of each student! The student
can now hear his own voice (which is an experience in
itself) and objectively judge his performance in the lan-
guage,
o o
The lab is not intended to be a short-cut to learning
a language and has been integrated into the six credit
hour language courses in the College of Arts and Letters
with two hours a week for the lab and the other four for
regular class work. At the end of the semester the stu-
dent is tested on his laboratory proficiency before he re-
ceives credit for the course.
It is thought that the language lab originated soon
o	o o	o
after World War II when the Holt Publishing Company
“cut” the Spoken Language series on 78 and 45 rpm
records. These recordings were adapted from the Army’s
materials used foi' speech training in various languages.
The main difficulty with early labs is that they were used
only for listening and could not record voices or be put
on a “listen back” basis.
An even newer concept is made possible by the equip-
ment utilized in the Notre Dame Modern Languages lab.
Intellectual Pursuit
(Continued from page 13)
that a child manifests some desire to enter upon a schol-
arly career. I am inclined to surmise that such youngsters
will often be found in relatively poor families. We too
often think that brains are to the manor born. This is not
at all true. It so happens that I am a member of a com-
mittee which meets every year to award scholarships for
college study to the sons and daughters of members of
a Labor Union. Two years ago, we considered four boys
with perfect scores in mathematics. Such a score is by
no means an infallible proof that a kind of genins is
present, but it is one of the most reliable indications we
possess. To help you realize how remarkable four perfect
scores are let me say that it would be seldom indeed that
one student of the two thousand admitted annually to
my college, though our requirements are unusually high,
will report such a score. And yet one Union could pro-
duce four!
Experience does not indicate that scholars necessarily
and generally come from the homes of scholars. Some
families have a long tradition of association with the
university, as witness that of Mommsen in Germany or
of Huxley in England. But in general I think scholarly
careers are the results of a sufficiently early discovery of
brains by teachers who have genuine scholarly interests.
That is why it is important that highly endowed young
people should be put in schools where such teachers are
likely to be found. For my part I believe that the ex-
perience of awakening to the intellectual life is likely to
occur early, perhaps at the age of fifteen or sixteen, just
as does a summons to the religious life. Of course there
are late starters — most of us know one or two — but on
the whole it is likely to be the high or preparatory school
which is the scene of such discoveries. This ambition the
parent must be prepared not to thwart or ridicule, but
he or she must also normally be resigned to having little
direct influence on the development. The best procedure
is quietly to help make books available, and perhaps upon
occasion deftly to see to it that a studious youngster does
not withdraw too completely, does not isolate himself too
markedly from others.
At all events, I should like to end by saying the Cath-
olic parent will not solve the problem of scholarly and
intellectual activity unaided. As fathers and mothers try
earnestly to guide their children aright, they must have
the conviction that the clergy are their allies. For what
we do not want above all is a divorce between the neces-
sary freedom of the scholar and the equally requisite dis-
ciple of the religious life.

Rev. MICHAEL J. SHEA ’04
XX
No - tre Dame •
by James E. Murphy
The author is Director of Public Information at Notre
Dame and a frequent contributor to this magazine.
The fiftieth anniversary of “The Notre Dame Victory
March” was observed recently at the University. Special
tribute was paid to the two brothers whose spirited song-
helped spread the school’s name and fame around the
world. Taking part in the observance was John Shea, 76,
a Holyoke, Mass., businessman who named and wrote the
lyrics of the “Victory March.” The late Rev. Michael
Shea, who composed the melody, died in 1940 and is
buried on the Notre Dame campus.
One of the most widely known and often played col-
lege songs, “The Notre Dame Victory March,” has
echoed in stadiums throughout the land. It has been
adopted by numerous high schools as “their” song. It
has also been sung by American troops going into battle,
and its tuneful tempo rallied the spirits of prisoners in
World War II concentration camps.
The “Victory March” was born in venerable Sorin
Hall on the Notre Dame campus in the fall of 1908, but
it was not performed publicly until the following year.
Mike Shea, then a layman, was an instructor in music
at Notre Dame and John was a graduate student in his-
tory. (Both earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at
the University.)
John Shea recalls how they traveled to Indianapolis
and Ann Arbor during the 1908 football season to see
Notre Dame’s games with Indiana and Michigan. But
the Notre Dame rooters lacked something. They had no
song of their own, and the Shea brothers resolved to do
something about it.
“Why can’t we get together a song for Notre Dame?”
John Shea asked his brother Mike.
“I’ve got a tune running through my head,” the mu-
sician said. “I’ll see you in a few days and we’ll get to
work on it.”
The two Shea brothers met at the reading room in
Sorin Hall. Mike sat at the piano, playing over and over
again the melody. John listened carefully, he relates, then
went to his room in the same building. Before “lights
o	o
out” at eleven o’clock that evening, he had written the
lyrics for Mike’s melody.
When Mike and John Shea returned to the reading
room next day to try to put their words and music to-
gether, the room was occupied. Mike, who was an ac-
complished organist, led his brother to the loft of nearby
Sacred Heart Church. There Mike’s melody and John’s
lyrics were joined, and “The Notre Dame Victory
March” was played for the first time on the mighty or-
gan. In the decades to come, the “Victory March” was
to be played, softly and slowly, at the weddings and
funerals of many Notre Dame men.
A little later, the “Victory March” was played in a
Protestant church in the Shea’s hometown. Mike Shea
returned to Holyoke on vacation and wanted to see his
organ teacher, a Professor Hammond. It so happens that
a new organ had been installed at the Second Congrega-
tional Church where Hammond played. So the teacher
and his former pupil met there with the professor nod-
ding approval of the Shea brothers’ “Victory March.”
Meantime, Mike Shea began his studies for the priest-
hood and was ordained in New York’s Saint Patrick’s
Cathedral in June, 1912. Because of his musical accom-
plishments, young Father Shea was assigned to advanced
studies at the Pontifical School of Music in Rome. Re-
turning to this country, he served for two years as curate,
choir director and assistant organist at the cathedral.
During the next twenty-four years Father Shea taught
ecclesiastical chant and other subjects at St. Joseph’s
Seminary, Yonkers, N. Y. In 1938 his health began to
fail and he died two years later.
John Shea served in the Massachusetts State Senate
from 1921 to 1925. Recently, he concluded a five-year
term as chairman of Holyoke’s Board of Public Works.
He still maintains offices as an industrial relations counsel.
Through the years the University has received many
reports about the “Victory March” being played and
sung at unexpected times and places. During World War
Il a U. S. Infantry captain wrote the president of Notre
Dame:
“Father, the big offensive toward Rome will begin
soon. American and British troops are lined up side by
side, and while tomorrow guns will be exploding, tonight
the bands are playing. And I thought you’d like to know,
Father, that they are playing not ‘God Save the King,’
not ‘The Star Spangled Banner,’ but ‘The Notre Dame
Victory March.’ ” The late Fred Snite, Jr., who con-
tracted polio in the Far East and lived in an iron lung
for many years, told of hearing the “Victory March”
played at a Chinese inn.
And so “The Notre Dame Victory March,” born in
old Sorin Hall, spread across the campus, throughout the
nation, and around the world. Its melody has uplifted
the spirits of weary football players and soldiers alike
And its lyrics have reminded Notre Dame men every-
where, and others, too, that victory can often be won
“what though the odds be great or small.”
Partnership with Notre Dame
Financial support of the University, in 1959, included contributions of $798,327
from 502 business, industrial and foundation leaders. These generous gifts were
in the form of research, scholarships, fellowships and direct subsidies.

Mr.
Rdward J. J. Tracey, Jr.
State College
HE need for

a
new library at the University of Notre
Dame is predicated on the inadequacy of the present
structure which was built in 1917 for a student body
totalling one-fifth of the current enrollment. This was disclosed by Father Hesburgh in
his President’s Page message and in the feature article on pages 2-3.
It is realistically obvious that a new library is unquestionably the most acute need
in the University’s over-all 10-year program of $66.6 million. To achieve this objective
will require the understanding and support of all Notre Dame alumni and other friends
of the University. If Notre Dame is to continue nourishing the spirit of academic
excellence, the best research and study facilities must be available for students and
faculty alike.
Complete details concerning memorial opportunities and other facets of the new
library will be published in the near future for interested donors.
