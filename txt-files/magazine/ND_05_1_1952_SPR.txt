Mrs. Fred Fisher Gives Collection of Rare Paint-
ings and Tapestries to University of Notre Dame
A collection of rare paintings and
tapestries by the old masters, valued
at $1,200,000, has been given to the
University of Notre Dame by Mrs.
Fred J. Fisher, widow of the founder
of the Fisher Body Company, Detroit,
Mich., it was announced recently by
the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C.,
President of Notre Dame.
The gift of valuable paintings
marks the second large donation by
Mrs. Fisher to Notre Dame in less
than two years. It was announced
in December, 1949, that Mrs. Fisher,
whose late husband was a member of
the Associate Board of Lay Trustees
at Notre Dame, has given $1,000,000
to the University for the erection of
a new student residence hall and for
a revolving student loan fund.
Mrs. Fisher’s prize collection, which
will be housed in Notre Dame’s
Wightman Memorial Art Galleries,
consists of seventeen paintings and
three tapestries. The paintings range
in price up to $150,000, while the
tapestries are valued at $30,000.
Four of the old paintings have
been evaluated by art critics at

A MEMORABLE and moving
dinner was given by the Presi-
dent’s Committee of Greater New
York at the Park Lane Hotel in New
York City recently. It was memor-
able and moving because it was the
last time that this group will thus
meet officially with Father Cavanaugh,
whose term as President of Notre
Dame ends, by Canon law, in July
1952.
It was an impressive gathering of
more than 100 outstanding leaders
from many fields, for the most part
non-alumni of the University, and
representing all religious denomina-
tions.
This was the third annual dinner
given by the New York group, or-
ganized three years ago, as the first
of the four President’s Committees
now acting as counselors and advisors
to Father Cavanaugh. Other Commit-
tees in Chicago, Cleveland and South
Bend function in the same way. Still
others in other areas are planned or
in process of organization.
These formal dinners during this
final year of the regime of one of
Notre Dame’s greatest and best loved
presidents will serve to lend impetus
to the Father Cavanaugh Testimonial
Fund. It was announced that the
New York group have already ob-
tained in cash or pledges some
$150,000 — more than half of their
quota.
The guest speaker of the evening
was Thomas E. Murray, who in addi-
tion to his preeminence in the fields
of finance and business, possesses one
of the finest engineering and scientific
minds in the country. He is now a
member of the Atomic Energy Com-
mission; and his talk was a vivid and
dramatic discussion of some phases of
present atomic endeavor, and the
fabulous possibilities of the future.
Frank C. Walker Unable to Attend
John B. Kanaley, Foundation Chair-
man of Greater New York acted as
presiding officer in place of Frank C.
Walker, who was absent because of
illness. He read a letter which Mr.
Walker had addressed to Father Cav-
anaugh expressing his regret that he
could not be present, and containing
the following statement:
“I have come to look on this occa-
sion as one of the outstanding events
of the year. Especially did I want to
be there tonight for I know it is to be
The President’s Committee
Of Greater New York
your last official dinner with the
President’s Committee, of which you
are the Founder. ... I had hoped
to report personally to you of the
progress that has	been	made	by	your
committee in the	three	short	years of
its existence . .	.
“In passing, I	might	mention	that
mainly through the good offices of
your President’s Committee we have
obtained in cash and pledges $150,000
for the Father Cavanaugh Three Mil-
lion Dollar Fund. Thus, at the mere
inception of an 18-month campaign,
we have acquired more than one-half
of our quota.”
Mr. Kanaley then introduced James
A. Mulvey, Chairman of the Execu-
tive Committee, who gave a heart-
warming tribute to Father Cavanaugh
and to his fellow members of the
President’s Committee. He pointed
out that the Committee, for the most
part, includes men who never at-
tended Notre Dame, and was in itself
an indication of what they believed
the University stands for in the life
of this country.
He recalled a time when he and
Father Cavanaugh were driving
through East Harlem on Lexington
Avenue in New York. “You were
quietly observing the neighborhood,”
he said turning to Father Cavanaugh,
“and you said, ‘If I had a choice of
what I would most like to do I would
be a parish priest among these poor
people. I could do so much good
among them’.”
“I don’t mention this incident as a
foreshadowing of your next assign-
ment,” Mr. Mulvey concluded, “but I
do think it is another example of
what a great man and what a great
priest you are. And whatever your
assignment I hope that Notre Dame
will continue to have the benefit of
your great talent ...”
“The veiy fabric of material creation”
In his address on the general sub-
ject of Atomic Energy in peace and
war, Mr. Murray said:
“Men have looked up. to the sun
and wondered why it has been flam-

EW blood” describes this
year’s “Fighting Irish” of
the hardwood. Both coaches. Johnny
Jordan and John Dee, are in their
first year as Notre Dame basketball
mentors. The new blood on the team
includes three starters who played
their first college game this season.
Those three —• Joe Bertrand, Dick
Rosenthal and Jack Reynolds — plus
oldtimers Jim Gibbons. Leroy Leslie,
Jerry McCloskey and Norb Lewinski,
round out the top seven.
John J. Jordan took over the reigns
as head basketball coach last Septem-
ber after Edward Krause retired from
the job to devote all his time to the
Athletic Directorship. Johnny, 42,
was born and raised in Chicago where
he attended Quigley Prep before en-
tering Notre Dame in 1931. After
graduation he coached Chicago’s Mt.
Carmel high from 1937 through 1949
except for a three-year stint during
the war as a Lieutenant in the Navy.
Jordan’s assistant, John Dee, hails
from Cedar Rapids, Iowa and played
for the Irish from 1944 to 1946 be-
fore he left to finish his collegiate
career at Lovola. Twentv-nine-vear-
old Dee coached basketball and foot-
ball at St. Mel high in Chicago before
coming to Notre Dame.
The team’s captain, Leroy Leslie,
from Johnstown, Pa., is the only mar-
ried man on the squad, having taken
the step with a hometown girl in late
September. He is 21 and a senior in
Business Administration. Last year he
won the team field goal scoring hon-
ors with an average of 13.2 points in
24 games. Early in February “Les”
broke former N.D. All-American
Kevin O’Shea’s three-season scoring
mark of 855 points.
Sophomore Dick Rosenthal, a 6’5”
boy of German descent, is playing his
first season for the Irish. “Rosie,” an
accounting major, comes from Mc-
Bride high in St. Louis, Mo., where
he was chosen all-state for his basket-
ball ability in 1951. He plays for-
ward and pivot, trading positions
with Lewinski and Leslie. This year’s
Kentucky game was his biggest sport
thrill.
Norbert “Gootch” Lewinski. a tow-
ering center and forward, prepped at
Mt. Carmel high in Chicago under
Jordan along with Jim Gibbons, one
of his present team mates. This year
marks the sixth in a row the two have
played the game together. After
serving with Uncle Sam, “Gootch”

tion for the F.B.I. His clutch play
was the deciding factor in wins over
Butler and Northwestern. He owns a
most effective hook-shot.
Joe Bertrand, first team forward
from St. Elizabeth high in Chicago, is
one of the three starters who played
their first college game this year. Joe
won 11 letters at St. Elizabeth’s in
three major sports. He goes in for
popular records and reading when he
isn’t studying political science home-
work. The Negro sophomore is one
of the team’s top scorers and a sharp
thorn in the side of the opponents
with his rabbit-like quickness and ball-
stealing ability.
Jim Gibbons, a junior speech major
and play-making guard on the Irish
squad, hails from Mt. Carmel along
with Lewinski and Coach Jordan.
A rebounding forward is Jerry Mc-
Closkey, plaving his second year with
the Notre Dame varsity. Jerry cap-
tained his football and basketball
teams at Central Catholic high in To-
ledo. Ohio. He is majoring in phys-
ical education in preparation for
coaching. The tall, stocky guard is

Jack Reynolds, a sophomore in
Business Administration and new-
comer to the varsity, was chosen all-
state in basketball and twice in base-
ball when he prepped at Columbia
high in Maplewood, N. J. In one
game he sank 42 points for his team.
This year’s schedule, one of the
longest and toughest in Notre Dame
cage history, was composed of 26
games of which 17 were on the road.
Highlights were games with nationally
rated teams such as Kentucky, St.
Louis, Louisville, New York Univer-
sity, and seven Big Ten opponents.
Although the team suffered a con-
siderable loss when three of the star
players who began the season were
declared ineligible after the semester
exams, the ’51-’52 record was very
encouraging. Next season, with these
young players growing in experience
plus fine coaching from Jordan and
Dee, there should be a marked im-
provement in the column that really
tells the story of success!
NAUTICAL
(K)NOTS
UNTANGLED
FROM Notre Dame to the Atlantic
Ocean it is a distance of 616 miles
as the crow flies. If you were jet-
propelled westward you would cover a
distance of 1848 miles before the blue
expanse of the Pacific came into view.
The nearest body of water of any size
is Lake Michigan — 35 miles away.
Yet, nautical terminology, such as
yaw, bulkhead, heave and starboard,
are tossed around in the Department
of Engineering Mechanics as if Dean
Karl E. Schoenherr, Dean of the Col-
lege of Engineering, Dr. Adolf G.
Strandhagen and Professor Francis M.
Kobayashi were “old salts,” who had
travelled the seven seas, holding down
mainstays for many moons.
People are continually surprised to
learn that scientists at Notre Dame,
although the University has no De-
partment of Naval Architecture, are
engaged in continuous research on
problems in naval architecture.
Led by Dean Schoenherr, who is an
internationally famous naval architect
and who was, by the way, one of the
designers of the first water tunnel in
the world and discoverer of an inter-
nationally used formula for calculat-
ing frictional resistance of ships, these
“landlubbing” scientists are working
on such problems as towing ships,
prevention of excessive rolling in ships
and undersea warfare problems.
How can these scientists at Notre
Dame, in the heart of the Midwest,
with no battleship at hand, in fact
with not even a little destroyer, work
on problems dealing with the vibra-
tions in a naval vessel’s propulsion
shaft? It’s simple! Or so says Dean
Schoenherr. It’s done by “electrical
analogy.” In one of the rooms of the
Engineering Building there is a maze
of electrical wires, conduits and ma-
chines. Various machines represent
various things on a naval vessel. For
example, one machine gives off in
electrical current the thrust of the
shaft, while another represents the
pressure on the propeller due to the
non-uniformity of the flow of water
behind the ship, and so'on. The elec-
trical impulses are recorded and then
transcribed into their' equivalent rep-
resentation of the ship. Simple?
Maybe Dean Schoenherr thinks so!
During the war the Navy tried to
solve the bottle-neck in moving sup-
plies by having one ship tow a vessel
without an engine. In this manner,
the troops overseas could get the ad- •
vantage of two ships of supplies from
the power of one. That would be fine
if the vessel towed in a straight line.
However, more often than not, the
ship did not track the path of the
towing ship but rather strayed off the
course, which increased the resistance
and reduced the speed of both ships
thereby rendering them more vulner-
able to enemy attack. In a heavy
sea a wildly swinging vessel may turn
broadside to the waves and capsize.
Many vessels are known to have been
AT N.D.
Mr. Strandhagen (left) and Professor Kobayashi doing research
problems in naval architecture
lost in this manner. Furthermore,
when travelling in a convoy there is
great danger of snapping the towline
when a towed ship gets off course re-
sulting in damage to neighboring
vessels.
In 1947, Dean Schoenherr, Dr.
Strandhagen and Professor Kobayashi
set about trying to solve this problem.
They developed a theory on direc-
tional stability, that is, they deter-
mined the laws which will keep a
towed ship following the exact course
of the pulling ship in a calm sea. It
was discovered that various lengths of
towline had a pronounced effect on
the swing and sway of a towed vessel.
For example, if a towline was more
than a certain number of times the
length of the towed ship, it created
instability or undesirable motions. Ad-
ditional information is expected to be
gleaned from changing the design of
the hull of the ships. The irregular-
ity of the seaway, the sudden change
in the wind, the failure of the waves
to follow a definite pattern, all play
a part in making the problem increas-
ingly difficult. However, according to
Professor Kobayashi, it is just difficul-
ties such as these that give the scien-
tist the determination to find a solu-
tion.
The effect of waves on pitch, heave
and yaw in warships is of prime im-
portance to all Navies. In time of
battle, a ship which rolls and bobs
excessively causes the sea to flood the
decks and develop a highly undesir-
able spray. “It’s rather difficult,”
says Dr. Strandhagen, “to fire a gun
with salt water washing your face,
especially if you are in one of the
outer gun turrets where half of your
time is spent almost submerged in
water.” If the ship is an aircraft car-
rier, the spray and flooding of the
deck will not permit the landing of
aircraft except for brief moments
when the vessel is on even keel and
its deck is not awash. Some of the
theories established in the steadying
of a towed ship will help in solving
this problem.
The “pet” project of this Notre
Dame Navy is the undersea warfare
problem. The submarines of today,
being manually operated by a helms-
man, dive and rise in a very irregular
pattern. If a submarine is 250 feet
under water and the helmsman is
given orders to rise to 50 feet below
sea level, the submarine rises in some-
what of a “stairway” fashion. It
goes up a few feet more, and levels off:
a few feet more and levels off. The net
result is a very awkward ascent. The
reason for this irregularity is the
danger of tipping the nose of the sub-
marine up at more than a ten degree
angle. If the submarine started to
rise, say, at a thirty degree angle, the
personnel would wind up sitting on
top of each other in the tail with all
the unbolted equipment on top of
them. So the helmsman is actually
overcorrecting and undercorrecting all
the way up to the desired depth. It
Mr. Karl E. Schoenherr
Dean of the College of Engineering
can be compared to someone just
learning to drive a car. They have
a great tendency to overdrive — to
keep the steering-wheel constantly go-
ing back and forth.
It takes years for a helmsman to
become proficient enough to eliminate
most of the unnecessary motions. Since
the emphasis today is on a great
number of high speed submarines, the
manual control operation is no longer
serviceable. The practical solution ap-
parently lies in the automatic regula-
tion, and Dr. Schoenherr, Dr. Strand-
hagen and Professor Kobayashi are
working on just that. They have de-
veloped a theory whereby the subma-
rine can be automatically controlled
to rise or descend to any depth with
one smooth motion and on an even
keel. This mechanical pilot controls
the rising and diving fins. It takes
the place of the helmsman. The first
public presentation of the solution will
be in New Orleans in the Spring of
1952.
It is really amazing when you stop
to think of all the research that has
been done and the absolute accurate
predictions of a ship’s behavior that
have been made, miles from the near-
est vessel or watertunnel. Sometime
in the future, however, Notre Dame
will have a watertunnel. This nau-
tical team is in the process of design-
ing one now which, when completed,
will far surpass in flexibility and gen-
eral usefulness the fifteen tunnels
existing at present in the United
States and other countries. This
watertunnel will also be unique among
water basins in that the model ships
and propellers will be held stationary
while the water will be forced past
at the desired speed and regularity.
Other basins move the ships. It is to
be constructed of stainless steel
throughout and will be a tool of first
magnitude for research in fluid me-
chanics. At present a one-sixth scale
model made of a plastic called lucite
is being constructed because as Dean
Schoenherr says, “It would be foolish
to construct the thirty foot tunnel and
have to tear it down every now and
then to get rid of ‘bugs.’ It’s much
simpler to build the small scale model
and iron out the ‘bugs’ there.” Of
course, it’s a slow process building one
of these tunnels since it must be con-
structed during spare time, which is
at a premium with scientists. It is
also dependent on the availability of
additional funds for the needed equip-
ment. However, they have hopes of
having it completed within the next
year- and a half.
Who are these men, these scientists
of “rig and rudder”? Dr. Schoenherr,
Dean of the College of Engineering,
is a revered man in naval architec-
tural circles. He graduated from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1922 with the degree of Bachelor
of Science in Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering. He received his
Master of Arts in Physics from George
Washington University and the de-
gree of Doctor of Engineering from
Johns Hopkins Universitv. From 1942
to 1945 he was Chief of the Hydro-
mechanic Division and the Principal
Naval Architect at the David W.
Taylor Model Basin located about 10
miles from Washington, D. C. He
ioined the staff at Notre Dame as
Dean of the College of Engineering in

function of the Church would be
gravely handicapped without the care-
fullv prepared body of documentary
evidence for its claims, and without
the Life-giving interpretations of faith
contained in tradition and history.
Notre Dame’s history department is
conscious of its responsibility to keep
alive the memory of man’s past.
In the five or six thousand years
of recorded history mankind has ac-
cumulated (and generally improved
upon) an incredibly valuable store of
experiences, insights, and understand-
ings. If these were forgotten we
should be as ignorant children, and
much worse off than Adam and Eve
at the moment of eviction from Para-
dise. This accumulation must be
profited by if we are to know what
we are about. Yet we can allow at
most about twenty-five years for a
man to start from dark ignorance to
catch up with civilization, to bring
himself abreast of the human race at
its best. It is the particular province
and obligation of the history depart-
ment to systematize, compress, and
express to its students this amazing
storehouse of human memory so far
as it concerns man’s religious, polit-
ical, economic and social life, as lived
in the great groups of the human
race. The constant hazard of the
task is the temptation to do it “the
easy way”— to let the student receive
the story passively and without under-
standing, to pick up a meaningless
vocabulary like a parrot in a public
aviary. Therefore the history depart-

ing these unimaginable centuries.
Other fires burn out . . . but the
center of our planetary system has
been incandescent for millions of
years. What manner of fiery energy
is this?
“It is Atomic Energy — the energy
of nuclear radiation. ... Yes, at long
last man has found that Atomic En-
ergy is the very foundation and the
very fabric of all material creation.”
Mr. Murray, who is a forceful and
eloquent speaker, pointed out that
within the last ten years the exploita-
tion of Atomic Energy has progressed
from a laboratory technician’s dream
into one of the largest industries in
the United States, representing a capi-
tal investment of five billion dollars
— which will soon be doubled.
Disclaiming any desire to rival the
Sunday supplements in delineating
Utopia, Mr. Murray said that the
possibilities of nuclear power are al-
most unlimited—more portentous than
the introduction of the steam engine,
the dynamo or the airplane.
Atomic submarines able to cruise
submerged at surface speeds for un-
told periods without refueling are in
prospect. Aircraft capable of encir-
cling the globe for months and
months at supersonic speeds will fol-
low. Miracles in the fields of agri-
culture and medicine even more as-
tonishing to the laymen are coming
in the not too distant future.
Mr. Murray concluded his stirring-
address by saying: “ ... It is for the
world to recognize in every majestic
scientific discovery additional reasons
for loving God and our neighbor as
ourselves ...”
Father Cavanaugh Reports
on His Stewardship
In his characteristically impressive
way, Father Cavanaugh gave a brief
review of some of the highlights of
his “stewardship” in the address which
brought the formal part of the pro-
gram to a close.
“A university to be great,” he said,
“must have a great student body; it
must have a great faculty; it must
have ample facilities.”
Notre Dame’s student body, he said,
has increased by some 50% since 1946
— from 3,389 to 5,006. Most of the
applicants were accepted from the top
third of their high school graduating
classes. They come from South,
North, East and West and 28 foreign
countries; and about 10% of them
are non-Catholic.
“We have a faculty,” Father Cav-
anaugh went on, “chosen from every
great university in this country and
abroad, and we are very proud of this
faculty. But we think at Notre Dame
that a faculty does its best work when
it itself is learning. So we have in-
creased in five years the amount of
money we are spending on research
from a hundred thousand dollars to
more than a million, one hundred
thousand dollars.”
Referring to enlargement of facili-
ties, he said: “Our budget in 1945
and ’46 amounted to about $4,500,000.
Today it amounts to slightly over
$9,000,000.”
Father Cavanaugh mentioned also
the Ernest M. Morris Inn, made pos-
sible by the million-dollar donation of
a Presbyterian alumnus of Notre
Dame. And he spoke of, among other
benefactions, the liberal and fine arts
center, the gift of I. A. O’Shaugh-
nessy of St. Paul; the new residence
hall, gift of Mrs. Fred J. Fisher of
Detroit; the loan fund for needy stu-
dents likewise the gift of Mrs. Fisher;
and the new Science Building made
possible through sundry gifts of
alumni and friends.
He described, then, some of the cul-
tural programs initiated or carried
forward during the last few years —
among them, the Natural Law Insti-
tute, the Medieval Institute, and the
germ-free laboratory technique (inter-
nationally known as LOBUND) de-
veloped by Professor Reyniers.
Father Cavanaugh’s talk, though
brief and informal, was indeed an in-
spiring summary of a great educa-
tional leader’s conception of the re-
sponsibility of a university in these
momentous times.
The evening closed with a question-

The Morris Inn, a gift to the University from the late E. M. Morris '06 of South Bend, In-
diana, will open in April.
Reservations from many friends of Notre Dame, the alumni and parents of the Students
are being received daily.
It is the hope of the University that the Morris Inn will help to introduce many new friends
to the objectives and ideals of Notre Dame, as well as to serve the many old friends and
supporters whom the University now enjoys and values so highly.
With this thought in mind we think it well to assure all of our readers that the facilities
of The Morris Inn are completely at their disposal, not only for themselves, but for their friends
and acquaintances as well.
Please feel free to call upon the management of The Inn for assistance in caring for your
requirements, or those of persons you direct to us. It will be his pleasure to render prompt
and efficient service at all times and nothing will be left undone in carrying out your wishes.
In the event your room requirements cannot be taken care of at The Inn because of pre-
vious booking the management will assist in securing reservations in one of South Bend’s
downtown hotels.
Please write, telegraph or telephone.

and-answer session in which. Father
Cavanaugh spoke of his convictions
on numerous subjects quite fully and
frankly, but with the request that for
the most part they be regarded as
“off-the-record.”
However, in describing the partici-
pation of the laity in the administra-
tion of the university, he did mention
a few facts that may be repeated
here, which will be of interest and
perhaps something of a surprise even
to those most familiar with the Uni-
versity.
“In our faculty,” he said, “of about
500, there are as many non-Catholics
as there are priests. There are 80
priests on our faculty; and 80 non-
Catholics; and the remaining 340 or
so are Catholic laymen.”
In answer to another question,
Father Cavanaugh explained that the
University is divided into five colleges,
over each of which there is a dean.
“Only one of these deans is a priest,”
he said. “Four are laymen. And out
of about 57 departments, some 50 are
headed by laymen.”
“Besides,” he continued, “we have
an Associate Board of Lay Trustees
which has been operating at the Uni-
versity for 30 years. Many members
of that Board are here tonight. And
there are councils for science and en-
gineering, and a council for com-
merce. There will be a council for
liberal and fine arts, and finally a
council for law made up partly of
alumni, partly of non-alumni. These
boards and councils by their advice
have more to do with shaping the
policies of the University, I think,
than any other force — and they are
manned by laymen.”
“For example,” he continued, “the
Associate Board of Lay Trustees has
been functioning for 30 years in
handling the finances of the Univer-
sity. Now, within the last three years,
its sphere of operations has been en-
larged so that it supervises everything
that goes on at the University.”
It was on this note — a friendlv,
frank, informal appraisal of the Uni-
versity’s policies and problems — that
the meeting closed. Certainly those
present must, in Mr. Walker’s words,
look upon it “as one of the outstand-
ing events of the year.”
Notre Dame students sponsor ‘Mardi Gras’ benefit annually for the Bengal
Missions. The carnival lasted for three days and featured many novel and in-
teresting attractions including (above) the Hawaiian Student Club booth.

1945. He is the holder of the Distin-
guished Civilian Service Medal, the
Navy’s highest civilian award, for his
research at the model basin in World
War II.
Dr. Strandhagen came to Notre
Dame in 1946. He graduated from
the University of Michigan in 1939
with the degree of Bachelor of Science
in Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering and with the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Mechanical
Engineering. He took graduate work
at Michigan and received both his
Master and Doctor degrees in Engi-
neering Mechanics. From 1941 to
1946, he was a member of the staff
at the Carnegie Institute of Technol-
ogy and was associated with the Na-
tional Defense Research Council.
Professor Kobayashi is a protege of
Dean Schoenherr and Dr. Strand-
hagen. His degrees, Bachelor of
Science in Aeronautical Engineering
and Master of Science in Engineering
Mechanics, were both received under
their tutelage from the University of
Notre Dame. He is now working on
his doctorate as well as being an in-
structor in Engineering Mechanics.
So there you have it; three scien-
tists working on ships without ships,
whose research, particularly on the
submarine, may well revolutionize
naval warfare; three scientists from
three different countries, whose very
diversified backgrounds exemplify the
truly democratic spirit of the Uni-
versity, pulling together as a team
“for God, for Country and for Notre
Dame.”
Sigma Xi at Notre Dame
The appointment of the University
of Notre Dame to Chapter status of
the Society of Sigma Xi, national
honorary scientific society, was ap-
proved at a recent meeting of the
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science.
Formal installation of the Notre
Dame Chapter of Sigma Xi probably
will be held in the Spring. Chapters
of Sigma Xi are in operation at the
well-known scientific schools of the
United States.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION
Recognizing the financial plight of the nation’s educa-
tional system, both public and private, the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers has launched an unprecedented
campaign to rally business enterprise to provide additional
funds to maintain and improve our educational institutions.
On December 20, 1951, the National Association of
Manufacturers announced the unanimous adoption by its
Your Contribution to Notre Dame

160-member board of directors of the Resolution on
Support of Educational Institutions. The Resolution urged
NAM's membership of more than 17,000 companies to:
1.	Continue its efforts to secure adequate local, state
and private support for a sound program of elementary
and secondary education for all American youth.
2.	Exert every effort to make available to higher edu-
cation the supplementary private financial support essen-
tial to meet the educational needs of our youth, American
industry and the nation. This private support may be in
the form of:
a.	Endowments, grants-in-aid, buildings and
such other items as may be determined.
b.	Assistance to qualified and worthy individ-
uals to continue their educational careers through
programs of scholarship awards and other grants
for education.
c.	Utilization so far as possible of the facilities,
faculty and staff of colleges and universities to
carry on research in pure, applied and social sci-
ence and in all other areas which will prove
beneficial not only to industry but tG American life.
d.	Assistance to demonstrably sound organiza-
tions whose funds are raised for and disbursed to
urgently-needed fields of specialized education.
Some leaders have proposed that business enterprises
set aside a fixed percentage of their earned income for
the support of education and philanthropic endeavors.
One estimate, based on an assumed rate of 3 per cent
of earnings, placed the potential total from corporations
at more than $1,000,000,000 a year.
