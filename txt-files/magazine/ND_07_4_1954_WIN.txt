Notre Dame
Today we find ourselves astride the
current controversy of liberal edu-
cation versus vocational education. We
are living in an age of science and
technology. Many educators think
that this should indicate a purely
vocational purposefulness to education.
A boy in college should mainly leam
the techniques required to be a chem-
ist, a metallurgist, a nuclear physicist,
a business administrator or a lawyer.
To this extreme, we answer that all
of us should leam, first of all, how
to be a man, with all that implies.
An electronic computer can work more
efficiently than a mathematician, but
it isn’t human. Only a basic liberal
education can teach us how to be
human.
Strong Base of Liberal Education
At the other extreme, there are
those educators who shun vocational
training as though there were some-
thing immoral about acquiring enough
professional competence in some spe-
cific area of human endeavor to ac-
quire a job and mature in it after four
years of college education. In answer
to this extreme, we do have within
the University, Colleges of Commerce,
Law, Engineering, and Science, as
well as a College of Liberal and Fine
Arts. Perhaps, it would be fair to say
that we try to stand between the two
extremes of this educational contro-
versy, and to build a good measure of
professional competence on a strong
base of liberal education. We take this
stand because we think that only a
liberal education prepares a man to
answer the really important questions
in human life. You have all been con-
fronted with these questions—what is
the meaning of man and his life on
earth? Why do men live together in
society? Is the state for man, or man
for the state? Can we learn anything
certain about these questions, about
what is really important in life? Are
there things of eternity more impor-
tant than the temporal troubles of
this life? Values of the spirit more
important than the values of material
things? What of liberty, and author-
ity? What of truth and error, knowl-
edge and opinion, beauty and ugli-
ness, pleasure and pain? Are there
basic truths and values really worth
living for, fighting for, even worth
dying for?
Without a clear understanding of
these basic questions and answers,
studied in the great classical writings
of theology and philosophy, literature
and art, history and social science,
mathematics and the physical sciences,
the best technician, who is only a
technician, will be unprepared to use
his techniques intelligently, purpose-
fully, and with the integrity that the
modem world needs. Hence, our in-
sistence on a strong liberal base. If
our students acquire the wisdom of
our Western culture, we feel that they
will be better engineers, scientists,
teachers, lawyers, and businessmen, be-
cause they will know, first of all, what
it is to be a man.
Million Dollars for Research
Having made this point of a strong
liberal base for specialized technical
training, we must add that we do
not think that professional compe-
tence should be lessened because of
this Christian cultural background. We
are constantly trying to improve our
professional training in the various
colleges of the University. We are
currently doing over a million dollars
worth of research every year to keep
abreast of the frontiers of discovery.
We want our students to share the
thrill of this discovery, and to keep
alive the great traditions of Notre
Dame, where the first wireless mes-
sage was sent in America, where the
basic formula for synthetic rubber was
discovered, where the first law course
was taught in an American Catholic
school, where the first wind tunnel was
erected for aeronautical research,
where the first germ-free animals
were produced.
The Spirit of Notre Dame
Today, these traditions are being
kept alive in an atmosphere that wants
no mediocrity that would lessen the
professional competence of the Notre
Dame men of tomorrow, be they in
business, engineering, science, or law.
True, the spirit of Notre Dame wants
to produce intelligent and good men,
but we will never view brilliance or
piety as a substitute for competence.
We want our men to know, love, and
serve God. And how is God better
glorified than by intelligent and de-
voted service to our fellow men, in
the line of our chosen life’s work.
Neither God nor man is well served
by mediocrity.

Door, Aug. 15, 1888 > ag°’ a re-
cession formed
in that sacristy door. It was the morn-
ing of August 15. 1888. A grave, crim-
son-robed altar bov. carrying a golden
censor, was followed by a group of
very small, well-scrubbed laddies, also
in red; and on their heels cassocked
and surpliced novices and seminar-
ians: and priests of Holy Cross and
men from other orders and dioceses.
Then there was the pm pie of many
bishops; and the small devout figure
of His Eminence of Baltimore, James
Cardinal Gibbons. And at the end. be-
can bridge on such an anniversary:
the failures, the successes; the heights
of elation, the valleys of despair; the
friends won, the enemies made; but
over all, for a good priest, the mem-
ory of God’s goodness to him and a
contrite recollection of his own defec-
tive stewardship. And I have no doubt
that as Father Sorin lined up in that
sacristy just prior to his golden jubi-
lee Mass, his memory was active about
many things. What did he remember?
Was it that day when, as a newly
ordained priest, not in church, but in
his own house, surrounded by his
mother and father, his brothers and






he preached his first sermon. For sub-
ject: the Blessed Virgin. It was a
theme to which he would return year
after year, for fifty of them, in which
the power, and the love, and the tend-
er mercy of Our Lady would be held
up for men’s veneration. Indeed, it was
a sermon which still echoes through
these grounds and beyond. For in spite
of all his faults and shortcomings,
there never was a more shining knight

d

of Our Lady’s honor. It was some-
thing which he has given to all of us.
His Optimism He must have remem-
bered. too. while that
procession was forming, his almost out-
rageous optimism that first day he
came to Notre Dame. It was cold.
There was a bitter wind off the lake.
Deep snow covered the ground. He
and his little band of Brothers appall-
ingly poor. Was he downcast, with
this prospect of nothing to work with,
without credit, without money, with-
out resources? He was only 28 years
old. He was too young to have what
we sometimes call the prudence ol
experience. He had placed his hand
in that of Our Blessed Lady, and that
was more than riches. He took the six
Brothers into the dilapidated remains
of the log chapel, and kneeling on the
dirt floor, spread his great, black cape
over the shoulders of his companions,
and vowed that he, and they, and all
who should come after him. religious
and students, until the end of davs.
would find in Our Lady's help, an
optimism not justified by an earthlv
queen.
A Tower of Strength There must have
been, too, a quick
recollection of that day, only nine
years previous, when, in a few short
hours of an April morning, this whole
university, this church alone excepted,
became a mass of smoldering ruins.
Sorin himself was in Montreal. But
when he came back the next day, he
surveyed the burning pile. The priests
and Brothers were fearful of what that
sight would do to him: the ruination
of all his years of toil and sweat and
triumph. But the priests and Brothers
had underestimated the man. He call-
ed them all here into the church, and
here, in this very spot, he showed the
kind of man he was. “If it were all
gone.'’ he said. “I would not give up.
This I began in her name: in her
name, I will rebuild it.” That was the
way he was for those who were weak
and afraid: he was always a tower of
strength.
His Americanism After that jubilee
procession had come
into the sanctuary, and when it came
time for the sermon, the Archbishop
of St. Paul, John Ireland, preached.
A great part of what he had to say
concerned Father Sorin’s patriotism to
the land of his adoption. He remarked
how Father Sorin, before anyone else
in the country, had sent six of his
priests, from the small and necessary
band he had. to care for the Catholic
soldiers fighting in the Civil War. And
that was before chaplains had either
commissions or salary.
Father Sorin's Americanism was ap-
parent. too. in his frequent urgings
both to his Superior General and his
French confreres—to leave France,
where they were hobbled with anti-
religious laws, and teaching restric-
tions—let them come to America,
which blessed country icspected and
protected religion without interferring
with it.
Even in small ways he had made
himself an American. He remarks in
one of his Circular Letters that he
is happy to think that he was not
given a French name, like Rene or
Francois, but an anglo-saxon name
like Edward, so easily made demo-
cratic by shortening it to Eddy or Ed.
I am quite sure that no Notre Dame
student, mindful of the Founder’s dig-
nity, ever called him Eddy. He was
probablv called others things, but not
Eddy.
The Last Farewell Five years after this
event. Sorin lay
dying in this house behind the Church.
He had been a sick man for over a
year, suffering from Bright’s disease.
But on his feast day. sixty-one years
ago, almost at this very hour, the dy-
ing priest heard a commotion on the
walk outside his door. He asked the
good Sisters: “"What is it?” They told
him that the student bodv and the
faculty were assembled outside to wish
him a happy feast. And with a su-
preme effort, he called for his cassock,
and his cord, his crucifix and his
biretta, and tottered to the front door.
All that he could do was wave his
hand at his greeters. But there was
one last message, spoken so low* that
only those nearest heard it. *T bless
you in her name!” and pointed to the
Lady on the dome.
We like to believe that his blessing,
sixty one years ago. was meant for us,
too. The changes in our world, even
the changes in our campus, could not
make him unmindful of us. his sons.
So with his dying breath. Edward
Frederick Sorin placed each one of us
in the hands of her who was his life,
and our life; his sweetness and our
sweetness: his hope, and ours.

Courtroom Techniques
And Procedures
Demonstrated to Law
School Students
(below) Plaintiff Mike Regan, ND
law student, reveals to the court that
his ‘player days’ were ended as result
of auto accident involving N-D. Pub-
licity Director James E. Murphy, the
defendant.
(above) Edward W. Krause, Director
of Athletics at Notre Dame, testifies
for the plaintiff during simulated trial
of injured football player. Judge Wen-
dell E. Green, of the circuit court of
Cook County, Chicago, presided on
the ‘bench.’
This article was prepared with the special
assistance of Professor Edward F. Barrett of
the Notre Dame Law School faculty.



A simulated trial that had all the
earmarks of an actual courtroom case
was held on the campus recently under
the sponsorship of the Notre Dame
Law School.
Numerous witnesses testified, includ-
ing Edward W. “Moose” Krause, Di-
rector of Athletics for the Fighting
Irish, and two South Bend physicians.
The setting gave the effect of reality
with Judge Wendell E. Green of the
Circuit Court of Cook County, Chi-
cago, presiding. The jury, composed
of beginning law students, was “sworn
in” and they gave all indications of
seeing that justice was properly ren-
dered.
- Two Chicago attorneys, one an alum-
nus of Notre Dame, represented the
plaintiff and defendant. Peter Fitzpat-
rick argued the plaintiff’s case while
Chester A. Wynne, ’22, former Notre
Dame football star and now attorney
for the Chicago Surface Lines, pleaded
for the defendant. They have often
opposed each other in accident and
■
■
negligence cases in the courts of Chi-
cago and Cook County.
“The purpose of this demonstration
trial,” according to Dean Joseph
O’Meara, Jr., of the Law School, “was
to galvanize the interest of the students
at the threshold of the schoolyear, and
to enable them to bring to their studies
the greater insight afforded by seeing
for themselves, at first hand, how the
judicial process works.”
The case tried involved a star
football player of “State” University
who alleged that as he was carefully
crossing a street near the campus
the defendant carelessly and negligent-
ly ran him down inflicting serious,
painful and permanent injuries, and
that as a result his days as a player
were ended. Both sides called eye-
witnesses to the accident. To make the
case realistic the Law School secured
from the University of Michigan a
film purporting to show “what hap-
pened.” The film was in four sepa-
rate sequences. Each of four sets of
witnesses saw the accident from four
different points of view. Prior to the
trial volunteers from the Notre Dame
campus and from the South Bend
community saw the film in the Audio-
Visual center. Each set of witnesses
saw only one of the four sequences.
Their testimony at the trial was thus
based entirely on what they had seen
in the film sequence shown them.
Neither of the attorneys conducting
the case was permitted to see the
film so that their respective prepara-
tions for trial were wholly based on
what their witnesses and clients re-
ported during the interviews which
took place on the day before trial. The
result was that the students attend-
ing the demonstration were brought
close to the features of surprise testi-
mony and contradictory testimony
which they are bound to meet in the
future practice as trial lawyers.
In addition to the testimony of
observers of the accident, medical
—

testimony was introduced as to the
extent of the plaintiff’s injuries. Here
again the testimony was in conflict.
X-rays were admited in evidence.
These purported to be actual X-rays
of the plaintiff’s alleged leg fractures.
Medical experts called by plaintiff and
defendant differed in their interpre-
tation of the X-rays introduced. In
fact, the X-rays brought in to illus-
trate to the law student their use at
trial of negligence cases were actually
X-rays of leg fractures similar to
those claimed by the plaintiff.
During the course of the trial there
were scores of points arising which
graphically illustrated the problems
the trial lawyer must be prepared to
meet. Messrs. Wynne and Fitzpatrick,
keeping in mind the purpose of the
demonstration planned their proce-
dures and techniques in such a way
that the maximum of benefit would
accrue to the students observing the
case. There were objections to testi-
mony followed by the court’s rulings
thereon, rejuests for instructions to the

Members of the freshman class of
the Law School were summoned to
act as jurymen. Counsel conducted a
careful preliminary examination of the
prospective jurymen and the atmos-
phere of reality was early created
when several of the prospective tales-
men were peremptorily challenged.
The jury’s final verdict in favor of
the defendant demonstrated that the
evidence had been carefully attended
to and the instructions given by the
court closely followed. Since the mem-
bers of the jury were freshmen in their
first week of law school study they had
thus at the outset an invaluable ex-
perience. They had seen the complete
trial of a negligence action not as
outside observers but as an integral
part of the trial process itself. Junior
and Senior students who attended re-
ceived practical training in prepara-
tion for the trials of their own cases
which will be assigned them in the
Practice Court courses (Procedure
IV) now required of all students in
the Law School before graduation.
The net results of the demonstra-
tion were such that it is hoped to re-
peat a similar trial at the opening of
the Law School next year.

preted X-rays of leg fractures similar to those
claimed by the plaintiff.

OPERATine 0UD6E

By Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C.
Executive Vice-President,
University of Notre Dame
FATHER JOYCE
To the ordinary layman, a univer-
sity conjures up thoughts of Gothic
buildings and ivied walls, shaded walks
and a peaceful detachment from the
rapid tempo of the modem world.
Such
a person would scarcely equate
a university and big business.
And yet, a university is big business,
with many of the same thorny prob-
lems that big business confronts today.
True enough, there are differences. For
one thing, there is a difference in em-
phasis. A large mercantile or manu-
facturing corporation has one main ob-
jective—to make enough money so that
the stockholders receive a reasonable
return on their investment. A univer-
sity has no stockholders, fortunately
for the peace of mind of both. Divi-
dends are apt to be few and far be-
tween.
Although a university is in no way
dedicated to the pursuit of year end
profits, it cannot be indifferent to the
financial factors that are the concern
of every corporation. It cannot ignore
the financial facts of life and expect
to live.
This is particularly true of the pri-
vate university. It is true of the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame. In fact, it is
more than ever incumbent upon the
STUDEHT5

ness organization to a high degree of
efficiency, to trim overlapping costs,
to safeguard its sources of revenue, to
spend wisely and cautiously. Every
dollar allocated to the educational ef-
fort must pay dividends in academic
accomplishments.
There may have been a day in the
history of private education in this
country when university administrators
lost little sleep over finances, but we
doubt it. True enough, when Father
Sorin first got his fledgling university
underway the financial legerdemain
was relatively haphazard and uncom-
plicated. The earliest students paid for
their tuition with a sack of potatoes
or a couple of shoats.
Today, 113 years later, the Univer-
sity of Notre Dame has grown from
a small provincial college to a univer-
sity of national and international prom-
inence, enrolling 5,400 students from
48 states and 30 foreign countries.
Much of this growth has occurred in
the past thirty years and we need only

793,000, with a replacement value pos-
sibly three times this much.
Even more interesting are the fol-
lowing figures. Although Notre Dame
o o	o
had over 2,000 students by 1923 as
against 5,400 today, the total cost of
operating the University in 1923
amounted to $551,000 as compared
with a budget of $12,000,000 for the
current year. Whereas the student
body has not quite tripled in the last
30 years, the total expenditures are 22
times what they were. This is partially
due to a growth in auxiliary enter-
prises, such as the cafeteria and the
Morris Inn, but it is largely due to the
rapid increase in educational costs. Ex-
pensive equipment is required for up-

to-date scientific and engineering
lab-
oratories. Teaching loads have been
reduced in order to give professors
more time for advanced research; sec-
retarial services are more widespread.
Salaries have increased and, in Notre
Dame’s case, the ratio of priest pro-
fessors (serving without pay) has de-
creased over the years. In 1923 sal-
aries paid to lay professors amounted
to $160,000. Today they amount to
$2,365,000. The sum total of Wages
and Salaries paid in 1923 came to
$284,000; today it is approximately
$6,000,000. If anyone should wonder
why professional salaries are only 40%
of the total salary picture, it should be
pointed out that the lay instructional
staff numbers somewhat less than 25%
of the 1,600 university employees.
All this will help explain why the
financial problems of the private insti-
tution are annually becoming more
acute and the operation of a univer-
sity more complex. Placed at a serious
competitive disadvantage with the tax
supported state schools, it is little won-
der that the presidents of private uni-
versities are utilizing all of the most
o
advanced methods of big business to
insure an efficient and economical
operation.
Here is how the problem has been
approached at Notre Dame. There is
a two-pronged objective. One is to in-
crease revenue, largely through the
Notre Dame Foundation. The second
is to realize the maximum value from
all expenditures. We shall discuss the
latter first.
An important move made by Father
John Cavanaugh during his tenure as

Campus Repair Jobs
Involve Shop Operations
Of Eighty Workmen
By JAMES LUND
The author graduated from Notre Dame
in 1952 and lives in Biloxi, Miss.
This fall when you were sitting in
your favorite football stadium watch-
ing your alma mater battle a visiting
team, you probably found yourself tak-
ing many glances at the scoreboard
clock—especially during the final mo-
ments of the game. You watched it
slowly, jerkily tell the last seconds of
playing time.
Ever wonder what would happen if'
that clock suddenly stopped? What
would the 22 players on the field do
if they didn’t know how much play-
ing time remained?
If your favorite football field hap-
pens to be the Notre Dame Stadium,
you will probably never have to worry
about such a problem—thanks to the
University’s Maintenance Department.
There are a half-dozen of the depart-
ment’s electricians behind the scenes
keeping close watch on all the elec-
trical connections in the stadium and
standing by ready to make any re-
pairs that may be necessary.
This is only one minute part of the
Maintenance Department’s enormous
job.
There are some 50 buildings sprawl-
ed out on the 1,700-acre campus of
the University of Notre Dame. There
are 20 miles of water and sewer pip-
ing and miles of electrical wiring; there
are over 10,000 drains that can be-
come clogged; there are thousands of
desks and chairs that can become
broken; and there are acres of grow-
ing grass, flowers and hedges—and
all of this falls under the jurisdiction
of Notre Dame’s Maintenance Depart-
ment.
Mr. Vincent Fraatz has charge of
the exterior maintenance of all build-
ings. This also includes the shop op-
erations involving approximately 80
men who do every conceivable type
of repair job whether it be plumbing,
carpentry, etc. Brother Roger Jami-
son, C.S.C., is Mr. Fraatz’s capable
assistant.
The key to the success of this de-
partment lies in its business-like or-
ganization. There is a shop for every
type of job on campus—tinsmith, up-
holstery, electrical, plumbing, carpen-
try and painting. And then, too, there
are the grounds crew, the labor sec-
tion and the plastering crew.
Work orders are processed with the
approval of the comptroller’s office so
12 Notre Dame
that all jobs fall within the current
budget. Complaints may range from
regulating the sensitive air conditioning
O	O	O
equipment in Lobund’s laboratories to
a stopped-up basin in a student’s
room.
The interior maintenance depart-
ment is headed by the Rev. George
L. Holderith, C.S.C., who for many
years has served as head coach of
Notre Dame’s golf team. Walter
Jaworski, Notre Dame alumnus of
the 1945 Class, is chief assistant to
Father Holderith. At the present time,
there are 120 maids, 60 janitors, 4
handymen, 4 student helpers, 1 win-
dow washer and 1 security man em-
ployed to keep the campus buildings
clean and orderly. The maids work six
hours each weekday and three hours
on Saturdays in order to take care of
the hundreds of rooms in 14 student
residence halls.
The Maintenance Department
reaches a peak in activity during five
periods each year which include the
beginning of each semester and Christ-
mas and Easter vacations. At this time,
every building is given a thorough go-
ing over; each room is cleaned, scrub-
bed and waxed; each piece of furni-
ture in student rooms is washed; and
each chair, bed, etc., is checked for
any possible repair job. Every build-
ing is put into tip-top shape for the
students when they return to school
whether it be at the beginning of the
fall semester or after the Easter holi-
days.
The “Lady in White” plays a very
vital part in the building maintenance
organization. Students refer to her by
that name because of her white uni-
form. She makes the circuit of all
residence halls inspecting rooms for
cleanliness and reporting minor dis-
orders to the janitor or handyman who
in turn will do the job without call-
ing in a workman from the shop.
One of the economical phases of
maintenance at Notre Dame is a mod-
em soap manufacturing machine which
provides the University with 6,000 gal-
lons of soap annually. The chemicals
are mixed in a steam-heated vat and
the finished product is stored in large
drums. The soap is used for cleaning
floors of all University buildings and
it costs about 60 cents a gallon to
make. Since there are hundreds of
window shades as well as chairs and
sofas which need constant repair, the
University maintains a shop for this
special purpose. They are rebuilt from

the frame and utilized in recreational
rooms in various residence halls. All
shades in campus rooms are checked
periodically for possible replacement
or repair and one individual is in
complete charge of both upholstery
and shade and soap shops.
During the summer period, about
nine of the University’s dormitories are
normally utilized by summer school
students. The rest of the halls at
various times are occupied by persons
attending the various conventions
which take place on campus. In be-
tween these busy periods, the main-
tenance crews are out in full force
getting the building ready again for
occupancy. During this past summer,
some 20 different groups totaling more
than 7,000 men and women occupied
student rooms during conventions and
meetings which were held at Notre
Dame. The largest contingent totaled
3,500 boys and girls, priests, Brothers
and nuns who were here for the Stu-
dent Mission Crusade.
In addition to the everyday job of
maintaining a smooth running opera-
tion, the department is often called
upon for “extra curricular” work. For
instance, at the pep rally held out-
doors prior to the Purdue-Notre Dame
game this fall, the electric shop was
responsible for rigging a public ad-
dress system and for setting up a bat-
tery of floodlights covering the area.
The carpentry shop handles a wide
variety of jobs ranging from repair-
ing broken desks and chairs to build-
ing altars for the hall chapels.
It is not unusual for the tin shop
to receive an order for cages which
will be used for research work in
Lobund. These cages contain germ-
free animals such as white mice. And
the electric shop always has a man
on duty in Washington Hall for the
Saturday night movies and plays that
are staged by the University Theatre.
The tinsmiths also are frequently
working on new gutters and rain

ings. A few weeks ago they finished
calking windows at the base of the
Golden Dome some 180 feet from the
ground.
The University’s 5 cars, 8 jeeps,
21 trucks, and 19 tractors are kept
in smooth running order by the Main-
tenance Department’s mechanic. He
also removes the “bugs” from snow
plows and power mowers.
At the present time, Notre Dame’s
Maintenance Department is housed
in a picturesque little sector back of
the Main Building commonly known
on campus as the “French Quarter.”
It is still necessary to operate more
or less under the same conditions as
many years ago because space is at
a premium. On the long-range build-
ing program, a new Maintenance Cen-
ter is scheduled. And the men who
are responsible for keeping Notre
Dame’s buildings and grounds in tip-
top condition are hopeful that in the
near future there will be a new and
spacious building for them to work
in. Until this takes place, however,
they are going about their everyday
duties with the same efficiency that
has always characterized the Main-
tenance Department.

dent’s place in the latter’s absence.
The Vice Presidents are also the key-
stone to the system of financial control
at the University. This control is exer-
cised through the important Budget
Committee which meets daily for six
weeks in the spring carefully scrutiniz-
ing the request for funds from each of
the University’s 124 departments for
the succeeding fiscal year. The Execu-
tive Vice President acts as Chairman
of this group which also includes, in ad-
dition to the other vice presidents, the
Comptroller, the Dean of the Graduate
School and the Director of Mainte-
nance.
When the Budget Committee con-
venes, the first order of business is to
draw up the estimated income for the
approaching fiscal year. Since the larg-
est percentage of our educational in-
come is derived from student fees, it
is relatively easy to arrive at an ac-
curate figure. Fortunately, Notre Dame
has been assured in recent years of a
full enrollment.
To the income from student fees we
add the estimated revenue from foot-
ball, from auxiliary enterprises such as
the bookstore, the cafeteria, the laun-
dry and dry cleaning plant, the vending
machines, etc. Then the grants from
government and industry on research
contracts as well as the financial in-
come from certain endowed funds are
added. We thus arrive at a total esti-
mated income of, let us say, approxi-
mately $11,000,000.
Now begins the Procrustean tech-
nique of fitting the expenditures to the
revenue. It is the age-old problem of
the average householder: the problem
of living within one’s income.
Concomitant with the u eetings of
the Budget Committee a cher com-
mittee is in session: the Committee on
Faculty Rank and Salaries. The recom-
mendation of this committee on salary
changes, after approval by the presi-
dent, are incorporated in the over-all
budget.
The crucial moment has arrived
when we compare the estimated in-
come with the adjusted, approved ex-
penditures. If they are approximately
equal on a cash basis (i.e., exclusive of
depreciation) we breathe a sigh of
relief. If there is a relatively small
cash deficit, we feel that it is safe
to proceed.
And lastly there is a need for capital
improvements to consider.
Notre Dame, like most universities,
has never been in such a favorable
financial position that she could fund
the depreciation reserves. It is true
that in years past, operating surpluses,
including those engendered by football
revenue, have provided funds for the
construction of new academic build-
ings. With sky-rocketing educational
costs and the increasing difficulty of
balancing operational budgets, these
days seem to be fast disappearing.
In recent years, Notre Dame has
been more and more dependent on the
generous gifts of its alumni and other
friends for the construction of new
buildings and the replacement of old.
Thanks to such generous benefactors
as Mr. and Mrs. Ernest M. Morris,
Mr. and Mrs. I. A. O’Shaughnessy,
Mrs. Sally Fisher, Mr. Thomas W.
Pangborn, Mr. and Mrs. Frank I.
Lewis, Mr. and Mrs. Romy Hammes
and Mr. and Mrs. Joseph LaFortune
we have been able to erect a beautiful
inn, a magnificent Liberal and Fine
Arts building, two new dormitories, a
bookstore, a bus shelter and a student
social center.
Thanks also to thousands of smaller
contributions and to the city-wide re-
sponse of South Bend-Mishawaka resi-
dents we were able to put up a Science
Building second to none in the country.
All of this points to the vital role
being played by the Notre Dame Foun-
dation. Its function has been to bring
the dramatic story of Notre Dame, its
needs and its educational objectives to
its alumni and friends, to corporations
and foundations, to all, in brief, who
recognize the importance of private
education in the American system of
free enterprise and who are interested
in the training of young men intellec-
tually and morally for responsible posi-
tions in a democratic community.
Although the Foundation’s efforts in
its early years were directed to fund
raising for needed new buildings, the
day is fast approaching when annual
support from alumni and other friends
may be necessary to balance the oper-
ating budget. In fact, the present cam-
paign of the Foundation, the Distin-
guished Professors Program, is a step
in that direction.
To conclude, a university today is
big business and its ivory towers must
be well equipped with comptometers
and adding machines. But even more
important, it must be imbued with a
burning zeal to use these tools effec-
tively for the achievement of its prin-
cipal objective, the education of the
young men entrusted to its care. If
the University is doing significant work
in the academic field, financial support
will be forthcoming. This has been
our experience at Notre Dame in the
past and, under the patronage of Our
Lady, we have every reason to be opti-
mistic about the future.

one of the outstanding leaders in
American industry, an honor that was
repeated in 1950 when he was selected
as one of the South’s foremost leaders.
During World War II he served as
chairman of the Selective Service Ap-
peal Board for Western Maryland.
Pangborn Hall located on the grounds
of Washington County Hospital, Ha-
gerstown, Maryland, providing modem
classrooms and every facility for in-
struction in nursing, together with rec-
reational and residence quarters for the
nurses is another example of their in-
terest in every worthy cause. He holds
honorary doctor of laws degrees from
Notre Dame and Mount St. Mary’s.
Mr. John Pangborn is vice-chairman
of the Pangborn Foundation, a mem-
ber of St. Vincent College Advisory
Board and has an honorary doctor of
laws degree from Mount St. Mary’s.
Among numerous activities, he has
been prominent in church work, in the
youth movement and other religious
and charitable organizations.
At the corporation’s observance of
its 50th anniversary, Father Hesburgh,
one of the speakers, said, “In no other
country on earth could this happen—
where two young men of meager re-
sources can bring forth in fifty years
the things we see here.”
Through the Pangborn Foundation
the brothers have given numerous
grants for charitable, religious, scien-
tific and educational purposes, and
have assisted many worthy youngsters
to obtain advanced education, numer-
ous medical research projects, and
aided persons of all ages in need of
medical and surgical attention.
The story of the Pangborn brothers’
business growth, progress and success
is phenomenal—91 of the 100 largest
manufacturers in the United States use
Pangborn equipment.
And next fall at the beginning of the
University’s 114th academic year,
Pangborn Hall will stand as another
tribute to Notre Dame from two more
of her devoted and esteemed friends.

INSTRUMENT MAY PROVE INVALUABLE
IN SURGERY AND PATHOLOGY
By JAMES E. MURPHY
Cancer leseareh at Notre Danie's
LOBUND Institute will be spuued
with the installation of a color-trans-
lating ultraviolet microscope, tin* Uni-
versity recently announced. The -S4(),-

mon Runyon Memorial Fund, is the
first of its kind to be made available
commercially to any college*, unixer-
sity or research center.
Manufactured bx the Scientific
Specialties Corporation of Brighton.
Massachusetts, the instrument adds a
new dimension to microscopic analysis
and enables scientists to make main
important microchemical analysis not
possible previously. It has many ad-
vantages over the conventional 01 elec-
tron microscopes including the fact
that living tissue can be studied and
the specimen need not be stained,
dyed or tieated in am wax. or touch-
ed by any outside agent.
"We arc grateful to the Damon
Runyon Fund for making available to
us this remarkable research tool which
will be extremely useful in our can-
cel research program as xxe seek the
cause of this disease." Professor Jami's
A. Revniers. founder and director of
the* LOBUND Institute declared.
"Moi eox er. this microscope xx ill pennit

Reynieis explained that the new

Notre Dame scientists to determine
what chemical differences, ii am.

Operating on a principle known to

learned that certain chemical com-
ponents of cells absorb different wave
lengths of light. It is known, too. that
almost am pathological condition,
such as cancel, has its own light ab-
soi ption pattern. Bv photographing
these cells and projecting these photos
through color filters it is possible to
obtain a full color picture on the
scieen of this microscope. In this way,
it is believed, scientists eventually will
be able to determine the chemical
constituents of normal and diseased
cells.
Until now. the color-translating ul-
traviolet microscope has been princi-
pally in developmental and testing
stages. It will nene be up to scientists
at Noto* Dame's LOBUND Institute
and a lew other selected research cen-
ters to determine how it can contrib-
ute* to out biological and medical
knowledge. Ultimately, it may prove

Notre Dame Students With Same
Names
Will Use Serial Numbers for Offical Records
most of them knew of their presence on
the campus, through the thousand and
one mistakes which have cropped up
through a confusion of names.
Father Lochner and his office staff
By JOSEPH B. TIERNEY
The author is a teaching fellow in the
Department of English at Notre Dame and
is studying for a Ph.D. degree. Mr. Tier-
ney formerly lived in Philadelphia, Pa.,
is married and has two children.
THERE are forty-three Notre Dame
students who possess 21 different
names—which may seem like it’s more
than par for the course, and it is. Re-
cently they met with the Rev. Robert
I. Lochner, C.S.C., assistant to the
vice-president in charge of academic
affairs, who explained the problem
faced by the University in keeping
academic records of this group straight
and to propose a workable solution to
the matter.
The boys not only shared last names,
or even first names, but the full
“handles,” of each one down to the
middle initial, were shared by some
other student. Twenty of the names
were held in common by two students.
Thus when Father Lochner called for
Michael J. Regan, two strapping
young men arose. There were also a
18 Notre Dame
pair of John J. Smiths and of Richard
J. Browns. When he called for John
J. Sullivan, three students answered.
Father Lochner stated that many
times students discover only when
nearing the end of their senior year
that their records have been confused
with another student of the same
name. This sometimes results in a loss
of credit for courses which the stu-
dent has taken, the priest said, and
it is not uncommon that a student
fails simply because his namesake is
a poorer student.
The Germans, I am told have a
legend about a special ghost which
they call the “Doeppleganger.” Each
person has his private “spook” which
looks exactly like him, they claim, and
these spirits materialize periodically to
perform mischief which is blamed on
the person they resemble.
Many of the Notre Dame men met
their Doepplegangers for the first time
and accusations and apologies came
thick and fast. “So you’re the guy who’s
been reading my mail,” cracked one of
the “twins” when he met his namemate.
If the students had not met their
counterparts before the special meeting,
finally came up with a solution, which
is no doubt likely to succeed. Every
student at the university is assigned
a code number when he matriculates
and the number remains with his rec-
ord throughout his enrollment.
Most students never learn their
number, Father Lochner said, since
the use of two full names and a
middle initial is enough to distinguish
o	o
their records from every other stu-
dent’s. The name-sharers, however,
will use the code as kind of a serial
number whenever a question concern-
ing the accuracy of their academic
record arises. “This seems to be the
simplest and most fool-proof system
possible,” Father Lochner stated.
While the system will prevent cleri-
cal mistakes, Father Lochner pointed
out, it won’t prevent the cases of mis-
taken identity which make the boys
wish their parents had tagged them
with a more unusual name. One of the
John J. Sullivans, either Sullivan
59730 or Sullivan 59720, offered what
appeared to be the best solution yet.
“If I ever have a son,” he said, “I’m
going to name him Sylvester Thad-
deus. I’ll bet he won’t have any
trouble at all.”
