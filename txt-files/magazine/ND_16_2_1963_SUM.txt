DEDICATED
000 &
Notre Dame’s $3 million Computing Center and
Mathematics Building was formally blessed and dedicated
during campus ceremonies on May 10.
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University president,
blessed the new facility which is built around a UNIVAC
1107 Thin-Film Memory Computer.
Two distinguished mathematicians, Dr. John Todd,
professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of
Technology, Pasadena, and Dr. Saunders MacLane,
professor of Mathematics at the University of Chicago,
gave dedicatory lectures during the program.
The new three-story Computing Center and Mathe-
matics Building is located immediately southeast of the
Notre Dame Memorial Library currently under construc-
tion. The new facility is expected to expedite research
in all of Notre Dame’s schools and colleges and will also
be used foi' the teaching of computing science.




The Computing Center and Mathematics Building
was designed by Ellerbe and Company, St. Paul, Minn.,
who also designed the 13-story Memorial Library.
The glass-enclosed computer room which houses the
UNIVAC 1107 is directly opposite the western main
entrance to the building. It virtually “floats on air” —
being specially constructed with an 18-inch false floor
and ceiling which serve as the incoming and outgoing air
ducts which pass through the various elements of the
computer and maintain rigid temperature and humidity
controls for the unit.
The UNIVAC 1107 is the first computer to employ
thin magnetic film memory and is an advanced solid-
state data processing system. It is designed to provide
solutions to phenomenally complex scientific and mili-
tary problems, by operating at speeds rated in billionths
of a second and accessing its film memoiy more than a
3
V
million times per second in normal operation. The
UNIVAC 1107’s two large banks of core memory, with
a capacity up to 65,536 words, are accessed up to 500,000
times pei* second.
Surrounding the central computer unit are offices for
the technical and maintenance staff, an active tape li-


brary, a tabulating room for
administrative offices.
The ground floor of the
o
Mathematics Building provides
support equipment and
Computing Center and
a programming library.
a staging area for card preparation and program services,
programming booths for visiting researchers and offices
for faculty members and graduate students.
The University’s Mathematics Department occupies
the second and third floors of the building. Three class-
rooms on the second floor can be converted into one
large lecture hall. Also on this floor are a mathematics
and computing research library, a seminar room, con-
ference room and faculty offices. The third floor houses
the offices of the Mathematics Department head, other
faculty members and several additional seminar rooms.

To direct the operations of this $3,000,000 facility of
the University, Dr. Hans Zassenhaus, professor of Mathe-
matics, was appointed director by Father Hesburgh.
Dr. Louis Pierce, associate professor of Chemistry at
Notre Dame, was named assistant director for Scientific
Affairs. Mr. Richard Castanias will serve as the Com-
puting Center’s assistant director for Business Affairs.
Dr. Zassenhaus is a native of Coblenz, Germany.
He formerly taught at the California Institute of Tech-
nology, McGill University, Glasgow University, the Uni-
versity of Hamburg and the University of Rostock. He
was educated at Hamburg, Rostock, and the Institute of
Higher Mathematics in Rome and spent 1955-56 at the
Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J. He is a
specialist in algebra and is a member of professional
mathematical associations in Germany,
United States. He is a Fellow of the
Canada.
As Notre Dame enters a new era

the University’s $18,000,000 Challenge
Program draws to a close on June 30 of this
year, I would like to share with you several
thoughts regarding the academic developments
of the University during the past three years
which are directly related to Ford Foundation’s
Special Program in Education grant to the
University.
It would be next to impossible to recount the
many intangible, but no less real, indirect in-
fluences resulting from the Special Program in
terms of spirit, morale, and heightened drive
towards the total goals of the University. But,
let me assure each of you with the broad and
seemingly exaggerated statement that the Ford
Foundation’s Special Program in Education has
had the greatest single impact of anything that
has happened in Notre Dame’s 120 years of life
to spur us on with unexpected speed towards
our total goal of academic excellence.
In the Summer of 1960, a new general
library structure was by all odds the most
pressing University need. It was the unanimous
consensus of the University administration that
nothing would contribute more to serious
scholarship, both on the part of the faculty
and the student body, than would a new mod-
ern library.
Construction of the library was begun in the
late Summer of 1961. Today, workmen are
busily engaged in preparing this magnificent
13-story structure for occupancy at the begin-
ning of the 1963 Fall semester.
From the point of view of a physical facility,
it should be one of the finest university libraries
in the country. It will certainly be the largest,
comprising 480,000 square feet of space. It is
a combination undergraduate and research
library. The undergraduate section comprises
two floors of 90.000 square feet each. This
will provide open stacks for 200,000 volumes
and study areas which will accommodate 2,500
students at one time.
A central research tower is 11 stories in
height. This will provide space for 1,800,000
volumes, 325 (eventually 750) private research
carrels and facilities for several learned research
institutes, all in the humanities and social
sciences.
A full basement has been constructed which
ultimately will provide space for an additional
1,000,000 volumes. Since this usage is not con-
templated for several decades, offices have been
built in this area to accommodate 243 faculty
members. The entire building is air-conditioned
and the offices will be spacious and well lighted,
providing excellent facilities for study and stu-
dent consultation. The convenience of being
located at the intellectual center of the Uni-
versity is obvious.
The new library will be the focal center of a
new East campus, but will also be integrated
into the main campus by a long mall (once our
antiquated field house is removed and a new
one built, hopefully soon). A dozen new build-
ings are planned for the East campus during
the next decade. Two of them are even now
completed (the Computing Center and Mathe-
matics Building and the Radiation Research
Building, the latter financed by the Atomic
Energy Commission).
In addition, this new East campus neces-
sitated the development of about 80 acres
with utility lines, the expansion of our present
steam and electrical generating plant, and the
building of a central air-conditioning system to
service these new structures.
I could list many other developments, not
only physical, but in the fields of faculty de-
velopment, student aid, etc. Suffice it to say
Notre Dame has come a long way in the past
three years.
With the continuing help and prayers of each
one of you — members of the Notre Dame
family — we will continue to progress, sharing
the firm belief that what we are doing at
Notre Dame is significant, good and most im-
portant for this nation and for the great
spiritual values of mind and soul which we
cherish.
Ever devotedly in Notre Dame,

(THE SECOND OF A TWO-PART REPORT FROM CHILE.)
by WALTER M. LANGFORD
We knew that we would have our health problems —
and we have. The record shows six appendectomies (plus
a few other operations), six cases of infectious hepatitis,
and hundreds of instances of dysentery, gastro-intestinal
disorders, respiratory ailments, and a normal amount of
dental work. Don’t try to tell us that we have been too
careless. We have received all kinds of medical advice
and instructions, we were given shots up and down and
back again, and we have guzzled vitamin pills like they
were going out of style. And we have taken all the pre-
cautions we could, but it’s simply unrealistic to expect
that we won’t occasionally pick up something or other
living in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.
Sanitary conditions simply are not the best in the rural
regions of Chile, and anyway they’ve got bugs down here
that our systems never heard of before.
A related problem has been that of the flies. Window
screens are almost unknown here and insecticides even
where used can’t do the job all alone. The result is that
the enormous fly population of the country really has a
ball. We are gradually making some progress in getting
the Centrales of the IER screened, but it’s not an easy or
a short fight.
Naturally, one of the greatest barriers our Volunteers
had to overcome was that of language. Clearly, their
work can’t be effective until they can communicate easily.
When we started training at Notre Dame in July of 1961
exactly half of them didn’t know a word of Spanish. Only
about a half dozen could communicate freely with the
Chileans on our arrival here. It must be noted also
that Chilean Spanish is truly hard to understand, plus the
fact that the Volunteers require a speaking knowledge
vastly greater than the ordinary tourist need. The simple,
practical phrases that serve the tourist rather well are
nothing compared to the fluency demanded in talking
with the people for several hours each day. But after four
or five months the language ceased to be a worry for any
of our Volunteers and the fluency that nearly every one of
them now has is really amazing.
Our PCV’s are expected to live and work with and like
their counterparts (the delegacies of the IER). This is
simpler to say than to do. There is such a vast difference
12 NOTRE DAME
between the two groups in background, education, and
way of life that they find little in common. Bridging this
gap has not always been easy — for either the Volunteers
or the Chileans — but by and large it has been done to a
really considerable degree. These two groups of young
people have come to understand and respect each other,
and many deep friendships have developed.
We anticipated a hot reception from the leftist press
which in Chile is both violent and powerful. They didn’t
disappoint us in this, though the attacks were nothing like
we had feared either in virulence or in persistence. Once
we were honored by being the target of a full-page attack
in El Siglo (the principal communist organ) under a
banner headline reading '‘Report on 45 Spies.” In this
and in all subsequent blasts there was dependence on such
timeworn phrases as “agents of Yankee imperialism,”
“Yankee agitators,” “capitalist activists,” etc. One in-
triguing story, reprinted from a leftist journal in Colom-
bia, at least showed imagination and ingenuity. In it we
learned that our Volunteers are supposed to be armed
with powerful dart guns the size of ball-point pens, bombs
camouflaged as cigarette lighters, and other such gadgets.
It is pleasant to report that the Chilean people in general
could hardly have been more friendly and warmhearted.
Everywhere our Volunteers have been received most cor-
dially from the start.
We were supplied ten Jeeps to aid in our work. Their
value can be seen from the fact that in the first year each
of them has covered in excess of 30,000 miles. At the
same time, due to the condition of most roads and to the
hard use they have received, they have often been a
mechanical and maintenance headache. And our Volun-
teers have had a few minor accidents, fortunately with no
injuries of consequence to any persons involved.
ACTIVITIES OF THE VOLUNTEERS
The work of the Volunteers in our Project must be
weighed against the three stated objectives of the Peace
Corps: 1) to promote better understanding between
Americans and people in other parts of the world; 2) to
lend all possible aid — technical or otherwise — to under-
developed nations; and 3) to carry back home and there-
after promote a broader appreciation of other peoples and


their problems. Clearly, the third is an “after-the-fact”
objective which can only be fulfilled following our return
to the States. Our efforts up to the present must be
judged in terms of the other two objectives.
The first goal actually is realized when our PCVs live
among the common people and set the right kind of exam-
ple. That this is happening is obvious from the number
of persons who have come to me to say what an excellent
thing it is for these educated, high-class young Americans
to come and live with the ordinary people of Chile. The
campesino thus gets the chance for the first time to come
to know some Yankees face to face and to see that we are
not what either the communists or our own Hollywood
movies would make us out to be. Let’s now look briefly
at the aid and assistance which our Volunteers have given.
This has to be a summary that just hits the high spots, for
otherwise the recital would be far too lengthy. Perhaps it
should be injected at this point that our original group
was comprised of 29 men and 16 women.
One of our best “breakthroughs” has to do with the
work of our home economists. These five girls were given
charge of the food program for most of the IER Cen-
trales. The changes they have wrought are both numerous
and important. They have introduced a balanced diet,
sanitary conditions in the kitchens and pantries, proper
garbage disposal, and a system of planned menus, in addi-
tion to teaching cooking courses and giving demonstration
classes. They likewise have already set up and conducted
two special courses for the training of Chilean girls to do
much the same sort of job our girls are now doing. This
training of counterparts is, of course, one of the prime aims
in all of our work.
NURSES DEVELOP OWN PROGRAM
Our six nurses have likewise brought a new concept
into the IER as they have gradually developed their own
program (nothing on this level of professional competence
was previously available to the IER). They have insti-
tuted a health campaign both in the Centrales and some-
what out in the countryside (or zona, as it is always called
in the IER). For the students in the Centrales this has
involved such things as chest X-Rays, immunization
against the most common communicable diseases, eye ex-
aminations, the establishment of medical supply cabinets
for First Aid and simple treatment, examination of teeth
(done by our one dental hygienist), and classes in health,
hygiene, and child care. Many of these same things are
done with groups of women in the centros campesinos.
Our several carpenters and mechanics also have had
a big hand in adding a new dimension to the program in
some Centrales. Utilizing modern equipment donated by
CARE they have completely installed four carpentry shops
and one mechanics shop. In one Central they teach a
specialized carpentry course and in another one a special-
ized mechanics course. In addition, they have built and
equipped a really modem vehicle maintenance shop which
is used for servicing both Peace Corps and IER vehicles.
PHOTOGRAPHIC LABORATORY INSTALLED
One Volunteer with naval photographic experience has
installed an excellent photographic laboratory in the San-
tiago offices of IER, with equipment provided mostly by
UNESCO, AID, and CARE. Counterparts are now
trained who can take over this lab when we depart. One
of our girl Volunteers, an art major in college, has worked
on the staff of the IER farm magazine doing art and lay-
out work.
Bill Fox (Notre Dame ’56 and a varsity fencer) is as-
signed to the lER’s Radio Escuela (Radio School) opera-
tion which prepared taped lessons on a variety of
practical subjects which are broadcast over some 35 sta-
tions and received in hundreds of rural schools. Lesson
materials are sent to the teachers to supplement the radio
program. Fox is carrying out a project of his own devis-
ing whereby he plans to visit — province by province —
every single rural school in the whole central valley of
Chile. If the school already subscribes to the Radio
Escuela programs, he observes the utilization of the pro-
gram in the classroom and discusses with the teacher any
means of making better use of the materials. Where the
school is not yet enrolled, he attempts a selling job to bring
it into the Radio Escuela orbit. The measure of his sales-
manship ability can be judged by the fact that of the first
250 schools visited he enrolled 108 in Radio Escuela.

The zonal work embraces a wide variety of activities,
including agricultural aid, cooperatives, health programs,
animal husbandry, reforestation, film programs, home in-
dustries, cooking, sewing, etc. Most of our Volunteers are
engaged in zonal work either full-time or part-time. This
work is far from easy. It is time-consuming due to very
poor roads, physical facilities of all kinds are most inade-
quate or nonexistent, getting anything organized is pain-
fully slow, and getting it executed is sometimes next to
impossible. The whole thing can often be quite frustrat-
ing — and occasionally most rewarding. Among our most
valuable workers in this field are Jim Fitzgerald, Dave
Coombs, and Joe Keyerleber (all N.D. ’61) and Tom
Scanlon (N.D. ’60). Mike Curtin (N.D. ’61 and fencing
co-captain in his senior year) is an important cog in co-
ordinating the cooperative and home industry efforts in
the main office. Mike is also engaged to my secretary,
Anne O’Grady (St. Mary's ’60). Tom Paulick (N.D. ’61)
keeps all records on our Jeeps and teaches classes in one
of the Centrales, where he has organized an impressive
recreation program. He also is a member of the town
basketball team which got to the final rounds of the
national championship.
PROJECT WON’T REMAKE CHILE
Obviously, it would take a whole volume to relate in
any detail the things that our people have done in this
year, with individual experiences and problems, anecdotes,
etc. Actually, we have in our files hundreds of pages of
such material in the form of semiannual written reports
which each Volunteer is asked to turn in to our office. Let
me assure you that these reports make most interesting —
sometimes even edifying — reading. Though I certainly
do not want to imply that our Project is going to remake
Chile in our 21 months here, I do know that we will leave
a mark in many parts of the central valley. Our Volun-
teers have made literally thousands of friends who now
know and appreciate Americans as they never had a
chance to before. The dedication, sacrifice, and daily ex-
ample (especially of the willingness to get out and do
manual work, something still far from popular among the
educated classes in Latin America) do not go unnoticed
by the Chilean. We can hope that the effect of this will
be like the dropping of a pebble in a pond.
Naturally, the conclusion is inescapable that some
Volunteers seem to achieve a little more than others. Some
of this is due to inherent differences in temperaments,
personalities, and capabilities. In other cases the differ-
ence might well lie in the varying traits of the counter-
parts. Sometimes the local circumstances are responsible.
To combat this latter situation, we have seen fit to make
changes in the place of assignment of some Volunteers,
almost invariably with favorable results.
Our first year and a half in Chile is nearly over. As I
have tried to indicate in these pages, it has not always been
easy. In truth, the problems, the frustrations, the crises
of one sort or another never cease. This we really knew
in advance would be the case. But it does irk us to read
occasional newspaper items from the States, penned, no
doubt, by smug individuals sitting in well-heated offices,
commenting caustically on what a soft touch the Peace
Corps Volunteers have, namely, a two-year, all-expenses-
paid tour to distant spots, with $75 a month salted away
for them back in Washington. This lack of appreciation
of the difficulties inherent in Peace Corps service is both
appalling and discouraging. It would be a pleasure to
lump all such critics into one bunch and place them in
any of several duty stations in southern Chile for the
coming 20 months. The resultant cries of anguish and
change of tune would be music to our ears.
Along with their many difficulties and bad moments,
these Volunteers have also had a million laughs, and all
of us have stored away enough memories to last a life-
time. And they realize too that their Peace Corps stint is
not all a matter of sacrifice and of giving. They them-
selves are getting a great deal out of the experience. They
are certain to return home with true fluency in Spanish,
a deep understanding of the customs and problems of a
civilization considerably different from their own, and
proven self-assurance, maturity, and qualities of leader-
ship. How else could they have developed so much in so
short a time? A good number of the Volunteers will also
return home with something more — a husband or a wife.
As of this writing, we have had three weddings and there
are four other engagements in our group. All of these
engagements and weddings are between Volunteers, except
for three lovely Chilean girls who have snatched off
some of our boys. More engagements are likely. So, foi'
these people it’s the Peace Corps and romance as well.
Who could ask for more than the opportunity to help
some of the world’s underprivileged people and at the
same time find a life partner?

POPE JOHN XXIII
On the occasion of the death of Pope
John XXIII, the following statement was
issued by Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh,
C.S.C., president of the University of
Notre Dame.
“All at the University of Notre Dame join all
the world in deepest grief at the passing from this
life of our beloved Holy Father, John XXIII.
“Men of all faiths have, almost instinctively,
come to call him ‘Good Pope John.’ In our
country never before have so many Protestant
churches and people prayed for a Catholic pope.
Why? Because they felt that somehow he be-
longed to them, too. And he did.
“His simplicity and geniality won a world all
too complex and serious. His compassion for the
poor and the suffering of all nations made him
one with them. His deep concern for peace and
justice in our times touched even the Russians and
the racists.
“All of these human qualities, divine in essence,
endeared him, as his Master before him, to the
multitudes who live in darkness and hopelessness.
“While his great heart and paternal voice will
be sorely missed, the great crescendo of good
will among all men that his pontificate has in-
spired will continue, we hope and pray, under
the guidance of the same Holy Spirit whose in-
spiration was so visible and so fruitful in all of
good Pope John’s life and works.”
Name New Assistant Dean
and Six Department Heads
A number of administrative changes were made in the
various colleges of the University this spring, including
the appointment of Dr. Andrew J. Boyle as assistant dean
of the College of Science.
In his new post, Dr. Boyle’s special responsibility will
be the management of the Science school’s buildings,
stores and equipment.
Also in the College of Science, Dr. Ernest L. Eliel
became head of the Chemistry department for a three-
year term beginning January 1, 1964, and Dr. Thomas
E. Stewart received a two-year appointment as head of
the Mathematics department effective July 1, 1963.
In the College of Arts and Letters, Dr. Julian Samora
was named the new head of the Sociology department
and Dr. Robert Nuner became head of the Modern
Languages department. They succeeded Dr. John J. Kane
and William J. Grupp, respectively.
Two new department heads in the College of Busi-
ness Administration were also announced this spring. Dr.
Bernard J. Kilbride was named head of the department
of Finance and Business Economics and Dr. John J.

F EVER you depart these shores
for Rome you will do well to
carry on your person a passport, a
certificate of vaccination—and a cer-
tain address: Largo Brancaccio 82.
The address belongs to a palace,
nearly 300 rooms of palace, located
in the heart of Rome, midway be-
tween St. John Lateran and St. Mary
Major. The massive stone structure,
architecturally Lorenzo de Medici,
was built about 1870 by Marshall
Field, Sr„ of Chicago, whose sister
married the Prince Brancaccio.
If in approaching the palace you
see a Renaissance man lolling on the
second-story balcony, be not dis-
turbed; it is a movie actor resting
between takes. Since film companies
rent part of the establishment you
may have seen rooms of Largo Bran-
caccio 82 on the screen: The palace
ballroom was used by Gregory Peck
and Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holi-
OS*'-


that says “Notre Dame Center.”
Above a pearl button is a smaller
sign requesting “Please Ring.”
If you ring, the door swings open
on hospitality. To be eligible for such
hospitality all you need do is hold
membership in the human race. Your
nationality, sex and creed have noth-
ing to do with it.
If the host who opens the door
is a stocky man of about 50, with
white hair and heavy black eyebrows
and alert eyes, that is Vincent Mc-
Aloon, director of the Notre Dame
Center. If he is not in, you may be
greeted by a powerfully built Fran-
ciscan with the face of an aging
matinee idol, or by a handsome
American not many years out of
Notre Dame, or by a charming lady
schoolteacher with a Scottish burr.

tributions, is open, as the card says,
“all day until late.” That means
from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m., but Vince
McAloon hesitates to state exact
hours for fear guests might feel
limited by them; he is willing to
open earlier and close later if it
suits a guest’s convenience. He hopes
eventually Lo have the center open

pier, for he is most comfortable in
the presence of problems. As you un-
burden yourself he leads you to his
office, a low cavelike dwelling with
walls encrusted by newspaper clip-
pings, snapshots, post cards and col-
lege pennants. If this atmosphere
does not have a soothing effect he
leads you into the lounge and serves
ecumenical punch, so called because
it is composed of many elements
working together and has been
known to promote Christian unity.

Vince McAloon, who graduated from
Notre Dame in 1934 has been help-
ing travelers in Rome since 1950. As
the Notre Dame’s goodwill ambas-
sador he has helped thousands of
Eternal City visitors.
your problem has probably vanished,
because Vince McAloon is a man who
can-do.
Not long ago a little old lady
came to Largo Brancaccio 82
weighted with woe. She had told
her story to a sympathetic Brother
at the catacombs and had been en-
couraged “to see Mr. McAloon.”
Tearfully she explained that while
she was gazing upward at the paint-
ings of Michelangelo’s Creation on
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel her
purse was picked. Gone were the
traveler’s checks, the around-the-
world travel tickets, and all her en-
thusiasm for travel. She said she had
dreamed about this trip for years,
and now all seemed ruined.
Vince McAloon rekindled her faith
in mankind within 15 minutes. He
made a few magic phone calls: The
American Express people said come
over to the office and get a refund
on the stolen checks; an agency in
Genoa said it would issue a duplicate
set of the around-the-world tickets.
And a tall glass of ecumenical punch
was served.
Last summer a prominent Ameri-
can Mason came to the Notre Dame
Center to ask how he could find the
headquarters of the Free Masonic
Order in Rome. This was so easy that
Vince McAloon scarcely counts it.
Another request that Vince Mc-
Aloon finds disturbingly easy is that
which comes frequently with a visit-
ing priest wanting to say Mass in
St. Peter’s Basilica. The priest, filled
with apologies, explains that this has
been a lifelong ambition, that he has
come halfway around the world, and
that he is prepared to hurdle many
hurdles. With a wave of the hand
McAloon tells him to go in the front
door of St. Peter’s, up the nave, turn
left and follow the corridor to the
sacristy, and there register for an
altar with the priest at the desk.
How to get a ticket to a papal
audience is another question Vince
McAloon hears often. He says, “You
have to be here in the flesh to apply.
Go to the North American College
Audience Office, at Via dell’ Umilta
30, between nine and noon or be-
tween four and seven. Currently
Pope John holds a public audience
Wednesday mornings. He gives his
blessing at noon on Sunday from his
balcony in St. Peter’s Square; you
don’t need a ticket for that, just be
there.”
NOTRE
A problem that comes up often,
and takes some doing, is the tracking
down of “Sister Mary.” People often
ask McAloon to help them find a
nebulous Sister Mary: They have
never met her, but they know that
she is studying in Rome and that her
niece lives next door to a cousin of
theirs in Beloit and that’s all they
know. Vince McAloon usually finds
Sister Mary, but an explanation of
how he does it is too long for this
article. And besides, it deserves to be
written as part of a textbook for
detectives.
EVEN if you have no problem the
hosts at Notre Dame Center are glad
to see you. Perhaps they can help
you with such mundane matters as
suggestions about hotels, restaurants
and tours.
As for hotels, McAloon will hunt
one for you if you ring him on ar-
rival (730002), and you may use the
Center as your forwarding address.
He says that if you want home-style
comfort better make it a de luxe or
first-class hotel; you can still get
hot water and service in a second-
class hotel, but anything below that
may be penitential.
Although Vince McAloon does not
mind penitential accommodations
himself, he realizes most American
travelers are not geared for hardship.
So when American-born Italians
come to Largo Brancaccio 82 on their
way to a remote village to visit some
relatives, he suggests that he phone
the visiting Americans (at the sole
village telephone) three days later.
He knows that the Americans will
cringe at the dirt floors, and the
closeness of the livestock, and the
lack of indoor plumbing, and even
20 NOTRE DAME
DAME HOSPITALITY
IN ROME
the lack of outdoor plumbing. He
knows that it does not take many
hours for remote relatives to com-
municate all that they have to com-
municate. And he also knows that
the Italian relatives will insist that
American relatives stay on and on.
So that is why he phones at the
end of the third day—to get visitors
off the hook. He tells them on the
phone that he wants to see them in
Rome right away. Usually they seize
this opportunity to make their apol-
ogies, sigh their regrets, and depart
promising a longer visit next time.
Vince McAloon is of most help to
young people who have to count
their lire. He helps them find lodging
for a dollar a night, and he directs
them to an off-the-beaten track trat-
toria where they can get a filling
meal for 50 cents.
For travelers who do not need to
count their lire, he recommends that
they try all categories of eating
places: the de luxe—Hosteria Del
Orso, Palazzi and Valadier; the char-
acteristic—Scoglio di Frisio, Alfredo,
Biblioteca and Meo Petacca; and by
all means a neighborhood trattoria,
where local folk gather.
As for guides, McAloon says,
“There are two possibilities, a guided
tour or a private guide. If the private
guide is a professional, plan on pay-
ing about $8 for three hours. If the
guide is a priest, seminarian or other
religious, you’re fortunate!”
Vince McAloon suggests, “To see
Rome go out southeast of the city
on the Appian Way. Make a hairpin
turn and start back in slowly along
the road the Roman Legions rum-
bled in on, the road St. Peter and
St. Paul came in on from the East.
Go underground into the catacombs
for early Christianity. Pass through
the ancient wall at the gate of St.
Sebastian. See the ruins of pagan
Rome, of persecuting Rome. Then go
to St. Peter’s and kneel at the tomb.
“On another day see the Rome of
Constantine, of St. Gregory, of St.
Francis of Assisi, of St. Ignatius
Loyola. On another day study the
Rome of Garibaldi and of Victor
Emmanuel and of Pope Pius IX.
Then the modern Rome of Mussolini
and the Olympics. And finally, Ecu-
menical Rome.
“Sight-see only about four hours
a day. I recommend from about mid-
afternoon until early evening. Take
it easy during the morning or go
shopping. If you try to do too much
sight-seeing in a day the experience
changes from adventure to grind.
The body, the mind and the spirit
can accept just so much seeing and
listening; after they are surfeited,
you feel uneasy and dull.
“But above all approach Rome as a
pilgrim and not as a tourist. This
doesn’t mean you have to change
your plans, just change your mental
attitude.”
Because Rome is the city of pil-
grimage the Notre Dame Center was
founded. Notre Dame graduates in
Rome felt that their alumni club
should do something in keeping with
its fortunate location. A hospitality
center seemed to be the answer.
Vincent McAloon, of the class of
’34, was the man to run it; he had
the inclination and the experience.
His first experience at advising visi-
tors in Rome came when he was a
soldier in World War H; he was as-
signed to make arrangements for
GIs visiting Rome.
Back in the United States the idea
for a hospitality center haunted him.
He read that in the Middle Ages each
country had its own hospitality cen-
ter in Rome. These centers helped
ease the way for the pilgrim, helped
him make the transition from the
known to the unknown. When Vince
McAloon read that there would be a
Holy Year in 1950, he decided that if
ever there was a need for a hospital-
ity center it was during that year.
In 1949 he started a pilgrimage of
his own. He landed at Lisbon and
spent four months walking to Rome.
He wanted to prove that the people
of Spain, France, Portugal and Italy
still have a sense of pilgrimage. He
had an idea that if he stopped at any
door and said, “I am walking to
Rome on pilgrimage; would you give
me bed and bread?” the people would
understand and would not refuse
him. He was right, for he was never
refused. The only thing that puzzled
anyone was that he was an Ameri-
can walking.
Almost every morning the family
he had spent the night with gave him
a package of lunch. Some people
tried to press a few coins into his
hand, but he did not accept money,
for he had determined to travel with-
out it. Time and again when he left
a village home the family requested,
“Pray for us at St. Peter’s tomb.”
Each day of his four-month walk
Vincent McAloon was impressed with
the religious feeling of the people.
That is why he warns American visi-
tors not to be guilty of “religious im-
perialism.” He says, “Don’t judge
Italians as Catholics by American
norms. Tradition, temperament and
circumstances leave their mark on
the manner of public worship.”
McAloon notices that some Ameri-
cans think everything must be just
the way it is back home or else there
must be something wrong with it.
He urges such people to show some
sense of adventure — especially in
food. He also notices that those peo-
ple usually have to be helped to relax
and not to expect everything to go
zip, zip, zip—especially not waiters.
Vince McAloon says that usually
he sees people at their best. Even
the most hidebound can’t help but
let his spirit stretch a little in Rome.
It’s a city in which everything is a
little larger than life and where
every turn speaks of great men and
stirring deeds.
Vince McAloon feels privileged to
work in Rome, and his love of the
city is one of the main reasons he
loves his vocation so much. It is for-
tunate for him, and for anyone who
visits Largo Brancaccio 82, that he
has found a vocation not formed in
a usual mold. In showing hospitality
he practices charity, each man’s des-
tiny in this world. True, he practices
charity in an off-beat way; but he
must do it that way, for he is an
off-beat fellow.

full-time for the doctor’s degree, in the Departments of Biology,
Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics.
In the College of Science are two internationally known Research

Biology, and the Radiation Laboratory, associated with the
Department of Chemistry.
The Departments and organized Laboratories of the College of Science
occupy a number of buildings on the campus: the Wenninger-Kirsch
Biology Building; the Germfree Life Building; the Geology Building;
Chemistry Hall; Nieuwland Science Hall; the Radiation Research Building;
and the Computing Center and Mathematics Building.
Today, Notre Dame’s ability to provide scholarships to de-
serving students is limited by a lack of funds for this purpose.
As an alumnus or friend of the University, you can recognize
the importance of maintaining the high level of students coming
to Notre Dame, and making sure that financial problems do not
exclude deserving students from the opportunity of obtaining a
degree from Notre Dame.
To assist these deserving young men, memorial scholarships
are available through the Notre Dame Foundation at remarkably
Sow cost.
