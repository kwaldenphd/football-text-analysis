Chrysler Corp. Gift Established

Virgil Exner, Sr. (left) is Vice President
and Director of Styling for the Chrysler Cor-
poration. He and his son, Virgil, Jr. are
Notre Dame alumni. Virgil, Jr. designed and
built this sleek sports car while studying
for his Master’s degree at N.D.
Looking out over their tree-lined and usually quiet
streets some long-time residents of South Bend may have
wondered if a time machine wasn’t working in reverse —
taking them back some 30 years.
Cause for this reminiscent head-scratching was a lean,
lanky youth with a thin, rather intense face. He had a
shock of dark and somewhat unruly hair capping a pair
of equally dark, piercing eyes.
He walked with a casual rolling gait akin to a sailor’s,
except that he always seemed to be in more of a hurry
than a sailor would be. He usually had a sketch pad or
several books under his left arm, but both hands were
stuffed into his trouser or jacket pockets. If you caught
his eyes as you passed him, he seemed to be at least a
million miles away in thought.
On occasion, this young man backed a small, partially-
completed sports car chassis out of a garage in the resi-
dential section and drove it unobtrusively as possible over
to the Notre Dame campus. The trips were not as un-
obtrusive as they might have been, however, since the
sports car had only a “token” muffler and the brakes were
still to be installed.
The young man was Virgil M. Exner, Jr., a graduate
student in fine arts at Notre Dame. He wants to become
an automotive stylist.
Just about 28 years ago, an amazingly similar-looking
young chap was seen around South Bend. He had the
same intense, far-away look in his eye and he usually had
a sketch pad under his arm and his hands in his pockets.
Instead of a sports car, however, his pride and joy was
a “slightly customized” 1921 Model T Ford. Fastened to
the radiator shell of the Model T was the emblem of a
far more expensive Duesenberg, and on the side of the car
the young Notre Dame student had attached the name-
plate of Le Baron, the firm of custom body craftsmen
whose work he so admired.
Also setting the old four-door touring car apart from
the thousands of other black ones then on the road was
some fine free-hand gold striping around the doors and
“belt line” of the car.
The owner of the Model T, who was in his second
year at Notre Dame in 1929, was Virgil M. Exner. Even
then he knew that he wanted to enter a field which at
that time was in its infancy — automotive styling. Today,
at 49, he is a vice-president and director of styling at
Chrysler Corporation, a man who has come to be recog-

nized as one of the nation’s top automotive designers.
Exner is credited with developing a new approach to
automotive design, as first embodied in the company’s
1955 “Forward Look” cars and more recently in the
newly-styled high-finned “Flight Sweep” line for 1959.
The similarity of characteristics, speech, facial expres-
sion and other mannerisms between Exner — father and
son — is striking.
Virgil, Jr., was born in South Bend on April 17, 1933
(while his father was employed as a designei' of car cata-
logs). Virgil, Jr., completed his high school education at
Granbrook Academy in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and
entered Notre Dame in 1951.
From February until June in 1955, Virgil, Jr., studied
fine arts in Europe at the Kunst Akademie in Vienna.
Young Exner was awarded Notre Dame’s Jacques
Gold Medal in 1956 for his undergraduate thesis which
was required for a bachelor’s degree in fine arts. It was
the first time that an automotive styling student had re-
ceived the Gold Medal which previously had always gone
to a painting or sculptor fine arts student. The medal
is named after Emil Jacques, a former head of the art
department at Notre Dame.
As his undergraduate thesis Virgil, Jr., had designed
a completely original sports car to be built on the chassis
of a 1950 (French) Simca. The undergraduate thesis
took him through the development of a % -scale fiberglass
model of the sports car-to-be.
Prior to that he had developed complete drawings and
specifications and had made a %-scale clay model.
By August, 1957, he had completed a full-scale clay
model of the car. At that time he received his master’s
decree from the College of Liberal and Fine Arts. Leav-
ing the car and scale models at the University, he depart-
ed Notre Dame for Aii' Force summer camp, Langley Air
Force Base, Va., where he was commissioned a second
lieutenant. He had been active in Notre Dame’s Air Force
R.O.T.C. for four years.
In October of that year he returned to South Bend
and worked for five months in the styling department of
Studebaker-Packard. During the evening and on week

ends he completed the painstaking process of making full-
scale plaster molds from the clay model of his car in the
University’s styling studio.
From March until midsummer, when he was called
to active duty at Shepard Air Force Base, Texas, he built
up the laminated fiberglass body panels of the car (work-
ing from the plaster molds). At the invitation of Gene
Casaroll, president of Dual Motors, Inc. (manufacturer of
Dual-Ghia sports cars), young Virgil undertook this work
in the east-side Detroit shop of Dual Motors. The car
still needed final touches, body sanding and painting when
he left for Texas in July.
In October of 1958, Virgil was assigned to 13 months’
duty in Korea, but was granted a one-month leave en
route, during which time he finished the car. Fully com-
pleted, it now has a plexiglass bubble canopy over the
passenger compartment and is enameled all white, with
a broad royal blue stripe running the length of the car,
atop the hood and rear deck area. He has stored it in
Detroit for the duration of his overseas stint.
Virgil sometimes refers to the car as the “United Na-
tions Special,” since he has parts in it from at least five

countries — the chassis and radiator are Simca (French) ;
the steering wheel is by Nardi (Italy) and it has a Ger-
man Volkswagen gasoline tank. The steering system and
universal joint are British and it still is to receive a Judson
(American) supercharger.
The Simca has a 96-inch wheel base, 10-inch Allin
brake drums, a 12-volt ignition system with lightweight
aircraft battery. The four-cylinder Simca-Fiat engine has
a displacement of 1220 cc’s (76 cubic inches). The stock
engine was rated at 45 horsepower, but young Virgil es-
timates it will be approximately 80 when supercharged.
The chassis weighs 1350 lbs. (he sold the body of the
four-door Simca which used to weigh 2,060 pounds).
The tire size is 5.50 x 15 with knock-off wheel hubs.
Virgil, Jr.’s instructor at Notre Dame was Associate
Professor Frederick S. Beckman of the Department of Fine
Arts. Professor Beckman is still in the process of develop-
ing the automotive styling course, which he has been
working on for the past several years, and soon hopes to
have it designated as “Transportation Design” — since he
plans to broaden the design training into other fields be-
sides passenger cars.
The Notre Dame faculty followed the development of
Virgil’s sports car with a great deal of interest. Following
the annual student auto show last year, Virgil was driving
the chassis back over to O’Shaughnessy Hall (where the
styling studio is located on the top floor). He chanced
to pass under the open window of a building where Father
Sheedy, dean of the College of Arts and Letters was con-
ducting a class. Father Sheedy later called Virgil and
asked, “Didn’t I hear that thing running around the cam-
pus the other day?” Virgil assured him that it probably
was since he still was having “a little muffler trouble.”
Father Sheedy replied: “Well, I want a ride just as soon
as it’s ready!” He was one of the first to try out the new
sports car when it was completed, and Virgil took it back
to Notre Dame in November for a “trial run.”
One of Virgil’s greatest concerns is that, if he is able
to pursue a career in automotive styling — as he hopes to
after his Air Force duty — that he be recognized on a
basis of his own talent. He undoubtedly absorbed some
of his feeling and approach to design from his interna-
tionally-recognized father — the fondness for the Euro-
pean flavor, and the ability to combine it skillfully with
a truly American flair, and the belief that a car should
look like a product that was designed to be driven and
enjoyed. Still, the two Exners already have differences
of opinion . . . for example, the fins on Virgil, Jr.’s sports
car rise vertically and taper inward toward the center of
the car as they approach the rear. The fins on most of
the cars his father has designed are inclined slightly out-
ward. However, Virgil, Jr., maintains that “my way is a
lot more functional.”
The ideas and designs of ‘automobile stylist’ Exner,
Jr., will have an impact on the American public in the
not too distant future — in much the same manner as
those of his famous father, Virgil, Sr.

Everybody today has an
opimcn on what is happening or should
be happening to education in America.
Even the cold war has taken an edu-
cational turn, so that the remarkable
assault of space by Sputniks and Ex-
plorers has led to an unprecedented
interpretation of these accomplishments
in terms of the Soviet and American
educational systems. In the underde-
veloped countries of Asia and Africa,
education is being viewed as the key
to the Pandora box of rising expecta-
tions.
In our own country, the debate has
taken several courses. There have been
lively discussions on the content of
American education: how poorly sci-
ence and mathematics are taught, if at
all; whether or not religion and moral
truths have any place in the curricu-
lum; the seeming conflict between tech-
nical or vocational education that pre-
pares the student to do some specific
thing, and humanistic or liberal or gen-
eral education that purports to educate
man as man. Then there have been
the embarrassing questions: why so
many teachers have been taught how
to teach without learning what they
are going to teach; why we spend more
on comic books than on textbooks; why
our teachers are paid and esteemed so
much less than our entertainers; why
so many of our most talented high
school students receive no college edu-
cation at all. Through all of this dis-
cussion there has been a rising emphasis
on quality of performance. It has been
rightly said that what happens to edu-
cation happens to America.
It was inevitable that Catholic edu-
cation should have become involved in
this discussion. Nowhere in the world
does there exist a Catholic educational
system as extensive as in America.
Never before in the history of the world
has the Church in a single country
undertaken to educate formally as many
students as are educated today under
Catholic auspices in the United States.
Nothing this large can exist without
being highly visible to the world about
it. Nothing this significant can con-
tinue without friend and enemy alike
searching for the depth of its signifi-
cance. And certainly, nothing this
widespread can increase and multiply
as it should without a continual con-
sciousness of its special contribution, its
inspirational motivation, and the inner
dynamic spirit that must guide its or-
ganic growth.
The relevance of all this to Notre
Dame is rather obvious. More and
more, we are being asked what specific
contribution our alumni are making to
solve the great problems that face us
today. The public generally is very
conscious of the quality of our per-
formance as a University, the selection
of our students, the excellence of our
faculty and our academic programs. If
any clear conclusion can be drawn from
the misunderstandings and the emo-
tional reactions attending the changing
of football coaches, it is this: Americans
generally want Notre Dame to be a
great Academic Institution, with high
ideals and high performance. They
want nothing to stand in the way of
this. Neither do we.

Five prominent attorneys representing federal, state
and local governments recently participated in a Notre
Dame Law School symposium on “The Public Service
Opportunities and Responsibilities of Lawyers.” The sym-
posium is intended “to help develop a tradition of pub-
lic service in the Notre Dame Law School,” according to
Dean Joseph O’Meara.
Speakers included Oscar H. Davis, first assistant in the
office of the Solicitor General, Washington, D.G.; Thomas
G. Meeker, general counsel of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, Washington, D.G.; Murray Season-
good, former mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio; Hugh Sherer,
chief counsel, office of the Attorney General, Columbus,
Ohio; and G. W. Snyder, assistant regional commissioner,
appellate, for the Cincinnati region of the Internal Rev-
enue Service.
Davis and Meeker discussed the opportunities and re-
sponsibilities of career public service in the federal gov-
ernment. Snyder approached the subject from the point
of view of a regional federal official not situated in Wash-
ington. Sherer described public service challenges in state
government, and Seasongood explored the lawyer’s oppor-
tunities of public service in the local community.
All agreed that government lawyers have responsibili-
ties commensurate with the benefits they receive. Their
job is to serve their fellow citizens, the speakers em-
phasized, and in so doing they must submerge personal
interests to insure justice.
For the young lawyer fresh from his state bar exami-
nations, government work has much to offer. Among its
attractions: a wide range of rewarding jobs, the experi-
ence needed to enter private practice, and an adequate
salary for performing a public service.

Seasongood pointer out that “new and fascinating”
legal problems have arisen in community development
during recent years as expansion-minded cities have gra-
dually broken away from “straight-jacket restraints” im-
posed by state legislatures.
Modern ideas in municipal operation and planning,
the ex-mayor claimed, have created many new posts for
talented lawyers and lessened the importance of political
party affiliation.
Sherer said the attorney general’s office provided the
“greatest challenge” for young lawyers. Newcomers un-
able to assume a full share of the department’s workload
are transferred or asked to resign, he explained.
Although admitting the election of a new attorney
general often ends the public careers of his predecessor’s
subordinates, Sherer noted the job furnished the practical
experience needed to make the shift to private practice.
Davis emphasized that federal government attorneys
must always keep in mind the national welfare. “The
government wins its case only when justice is done,” he
remarked. “And consequently its lawyers have strong ob-
ligations not to be unfair or inflammatory.”
Meeker expressed the belief that federal service gener-
all offered attorneys above-normal opportunities to ex-
ercise individual responsibility and initiative, thus en-
abling them to readily develop their professional skills.
Since the government has virtually every type of prac-
tice— litigation, corporate problems, taxation, etc., — a
lawyer’s legal horizon is unlimited, Meeker said. “The
chance for public service, combined with the challenge of
a great variety of complex legal problems ... is more
than enough to excite enthusiasm.”
Snyder disclosed that the Internal Revenue Service has
a continuing demand for promising attorneys with ac-
counting backgrounds. In this work, he pointed out, “the
compensation standards are good ($4,980 per year after
a six-month training period) and there are excellent op-
portunities for advancement.”
Lawyers entering the tax-collecting field serve their
country in a unique manner, the commissioner added,
“the effectiveness of (America’s) defense depends in a
large measure on the power and ability of our government
to raise revenue by taxation; this is essential to the mainte-
nance of our American way of life.”

No nation in the world has a population with such
enormous differences of race, color and faith as the
United States. Here one finds people from every land
and of every faith under the sun. This endless variety
has given to our culture a richness unparalleled in history:
it constitutes the unique genius and the distinctive glory
of America, and has compelled the admiration of the
whole civilized world. In the mighty symphony of Ameri-
can life the immigrant catches echoes of the mores,
thought, aspirations and dreams of Iris native land and
speedily finds himself at home among us.
Learning to live together means learning not only to
feel at ease with people who, while devoted to America
and its ideals, are of different racial origins and religious
faiths, but also to respect those differences. This calls for
tolerance, mutual esteem, understanding, good will and
even brotherhood among all the multitudinous ethnic and
religious groups making up our cosmopolitan society.
The problem is not an easy one: its solution goes
against the grain of instinctive feeling. It calls for clear
thinking, self-discipline and a respect for the sanctity of
the human personality with its inevitable differences: the
unfailing mark of a truly civilized person.
Staining the annals of our history are the waves of
organized bigotry which periodically sweep across our
land. Notorious among these were the Nativist movement
of the 1830’s, the Know-Nothing campaign of the 1850’s,
the Loyalty League, the original Ku Klux Klan and allied
movements of the post-Civil War period, the American
Protective Association of the 1890’s, the revived Ku Klux
Klan after World War I and the anti-Semitism of the
1930’s.

religious prejudice is the National Conference of Chris-

and ultimately eliminate intergroup prejudices, which dis-
figure and distort religious, business, social and political
relations, with a view to the establishment of friendly hu-
man relationships.
Along with Dr. John Sutherland Bonnell, pastor of
the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church of New York, and
Rabbi Maurice N. Eisendrath, President of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, I have been co-chair-
man of the Conference’s commission on religious organi-
o	o
zations for many years. In that capacity I have traveled
thousands of miles, attended innumerable meetings and
listened to lengthy discussion of the causes of racial and
religious antagonism and of the means of eradicating
them. Out of those years of experience have emerged
three simple conclusions which seem to be of widespread
interest and far-reaching significance.
First. No single group, racial or religious, should have
to “go it alone.” It should have allies to present its case
BOSTON (UP1)—The Jewish Advocate today
named Richard Cardinal Cushing of Boston as
“man of the year.”
The Jewish newspaper hailed the Roman Cath-
olic prelate “as a churchman ... as an orator . . .
(and) as an administrator.” It cited his work for
schools and hospitals.
The citation emphasized the cardinal’s “forth-
right statement that there is nothing in Catholic
doctrine that should adversely affect the attitude
of the Christian towards Jews.”
objectively and fairly when it is misrepresented and mis-
understood.
Second. Most antagonisms and prejudices spring
from misconceptions of the other group’s beliefs, motives
and purposes. This is particularly true of religious ani-
mosity. Upon investigation it is found to be directed not
against the actual belief and practice of people of a dif-
ferent religion but against the misconceptions of them
which exist in our minds. Hence most of us war against
caricatures, ghosts that haunt our imagination and bats
in our mental belfries.
Third. The remedy is to correct the misconceptions
in an objective and friendly manner, to promote wider
and better understanding between members of different
faiths, and to work together on all matters affecting the
welfare of the community, state and nation.
Let us now scrutinize the causes of suspicion, distrust
and prejudice against Jews. Let us see if they are not
largely traceable to misunderstandings and misconceptions.
What then are some of the more common charges
against Jews? They control Wall Street, it is alleged, and
exercise an undue economic influence in the United
States. Similar charges were made by the Nazis as a sim-
ple prelude to the confiscation of Jewish possessions
throughout Germany.
What are the facts? Fortune, a non-Jewish magazine,
made a painstaking investigation of the economic status
of Jews in this country. The findings disclosed that Jew-
ish dominance of the American economy was a pure myth.
“A vast continent of heavy industry and finance may be
staked out,” reported Fortune, “in which Jewish partici-
pation is incidental or non-existent. . . . The Jews are so
far from controlling the most characteristic of present-day
American activities that they are hardly represented in
them at all.”
Jews, it is charged, control the press, movies, radio,
television and theater and thus unduly influence American
public opinion. How different are the facts? The Inter-
national Yearbook of Editor and Publisher shows that
only 3% per cent of the daily newspapers are owned or
controlled by Jews, while only three general magazines
are classified as under Jewish control.
True, Jews are well represented in the movies, radio,
television and theater business, in which they have demon-
strated marked talent and ability. But the acceptance of
movies, shows, radio and television programs is deter-
mined not by the producers but by the American public,
in which Jews constitute but a tiny fraction.
Thus all the basic charges repeated with endless varia-
tions against the Jews of America are seen to be without
foundation in fact. They are based upon misconceptions
and rumors: upon investigation the labels so often pinned
on Jews prove to be libels and the charges turn out to be
fabrications and myths.
When I was the chaplain of the Catholic students at
the University of Illinois, Rabbi Frankel confided to our
Religious Workers’ Association that Jewish students were
finding difficulty in getting lodgings in homes near the
campus. At the suggestion of a big-hearted Methodist
minister, Rev. James C. Baker, now a bishop, chaplains
of all faiths appealed to their congregations to end such
discrimination and to welcome Jewish students into their
homes. The response was as immediate as it was over-
whelming.
Brandeis University, presided over by my old friend,
Dr. Abram Sachar, is Jewish-sponsored but non-sectarian.
When it invited Archbishop Cushing to bless its new
Bethlehem Chapel for the use of its Catholic students, he
readily accepted. Immediately a splinter group of fanati-
cal Jew-haters raised a frenzied hue and cry of protest.
Ignoring their efforts at intimidation the great archbishop,
whose broad human sympathy and unfailing kindness
have won the hearts of all Boston, went to the campus,
blessed the chapel > and offered the first Mass.
In America we can transform our differences into op-
portunities for growth in tolerance, understanding and
brotherhood and thus enrich and deepen our spiritual life.
When a grain of sand gets lodged in an oyster, instead of
vainly brooding over the irritation, the mollusk transforms
the grain into the most precious thing within its power —
a shining pearl.
So can we transmute our differences into the shining
pearls of understanding and brotherhood: the precious
jewels of the spirit. Paraphrasing the title of a book pop-
ular a few decades ago, “Live Alone and Like It,” we in
America can live together and like it.

NOTRE DAME
String and band instrumental training classes were organized for parochial school children by Dr. Biondo. During the University’s
Summer School session, these youngsters form a ‘demonstration class’ for graduate students.
By C. A. BIONDO
The Music Department of the University of Notre
Dame has, during the past five years, extended its con-
tribution to instrumental music development not only at
the University itself, but also in the South Bend-Misha-
waka community and on the national scene. Its desire to
contribute further to this relatively new field in Catholic
education received an impetus through a questionnaire
distributed by this writer to selected Catholic High Schools
across the nation in an effort to ascertain the degree and
type of instrumental training in the parochial schools.
Returns from these questionnaires were so appalling that
it was immediately resolved to do something about elimi-
nating this significant deficiency.
The South Bend parochial schools were organized as
a ‘proving ground* in string and band instrumental train-
ing programs. The best qualified upperclassmen of the
Music Department volunteered to serve, so that each
would have one or two schools to instruct, at a nominal
fee, after taking appropriate courses in methods and tech-
niques. Currently eight schools are participating in the
program with two string and two band teachers doing

The Per Musica Society, directed by Dr. Biondo, is a professional chamber group sponsored by Notre Dame and St. Mary’s College.

A center for philosophical research honoring Jacques
Mari tain, celebrated Thom is t, has been estab-
lished at Notre Dame. His writings will be systematic-
ally indexed and catalogued at the Maritain Center. In
a statement Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., presi-
dent, predicted that the new University unit will become
a place of “significant philosophical activity and publica-
tion.” It will also serve, he said, as a kind of international
clearing house for the students and friends of Maritain
and his work.
It was also announced that Dr. Joseph W. Evans, as-
sociate professor of philosophy, has been appointed direc-
tor of the new Maritain Center. Associated with him will
be Rev. Leo R. Ward, C.S.C., professor of philosophy,
and Frank L. Keegan, assistant professor in the Univer-
sity’s General Program of Liberal Education. A board of
consultants, composed of both American and European
scholars, will be named later.
Maritain, now professor emeritus of philosophy at
Princeton University, has lectured regularly at Notre
Dame since 1948. Regarded as one of the great minds
of our day, he is a pre-eminent interpreter of the philoso-
phy of St. Thomas Aquinas. He is the author of more
than fifty philosophical works, and he has contributed
countless articles to the leading philosophical journals
of the world. His latest book, Reflections on America, is
a non-technical work which has received high praise from
American critics for its remarkably acute and sympathetic
insights into American life. He is currently working on
a two-volume study in moral philosophy.
In addition to his long associations with Notre Dame
and Princeton, Maritain has also taught at the Catholic
Institute of Paris, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval
Studies in Toronto, Columbia University, and the Com-
mittee on Social Thought in the University of Chicago.
From 1945 to 1948 he was French ambassador to the
Vatican. He also served as president of the French dele-
gation to the second international conference of UNESCO
at Mexico City in November, 1947. His inaugural address
on that occasion on “The Possibilities fox' Cooperation in
a Divided World” is one of his most influential contribu-
tions to social and political philosophy.
Maritain’s first book, La Philosophic Bergsonienne,
was published in Paris in 1914. Among his major works
are The Degrees of Know.edge, A Preface to Metaphydcs,
Existence and the Existent, Science and Wisdom, Ait and
Scholasticism, Creative Intuition in Art and Poetry, True
Humanism, The Person an-. the Common Good, Man
and the State, and On the Philosophy of Hi tory.
Professor Evans and his associates at Notre Dame be-
lieve that Maritain has much to give to the modern world.
They see him as having to a pre-eminent degree what	t
contemporary man, for all his grandeur, seems to be	“
sadly lacking — the sense of being and the sense of love.	J
Maritain, they feel, is a man “so admirably attentive to
the real, a man who goes beyond phenomena and signs,	t
a man who really conies to grips with the deepest dimen-
sions of things, a man who distinguishes in order to unite,
in short, a man who really sees.” There is in Maritain,
Professor Evans says, “a rich and far-flung mine of chal-
lenging insights, illuminating distinctions, and strikingly
o o	o ’	O	*	O -
new avenues of thought. The Maritain Center,” he ex-
plains, “will strive to put special emphasis on the study of	’
these new philosophical ideas. Any living and creative
thought, no matter how well formed and articulated its
expression may be. has need ceaselessly to grow. We	’
would like to think that our humble efforts will assist
Jacques Maritain’s thought to take root and grow in manv
minds of this and future generations.”
But the men associated with the new Maritain Centex'
would also endeavoi' to learn, and to have others leam,	;
from Maritain’s “profound sense of love.” This sense of	|
love, they say, has touched and stirred people in even’	i
walk of life. What, they ask, are the sources of such a
love? What are its implications for intellectual life itself,	!
fox' social and political life? What can we leant from	j
such an “apostle of love?” What can we learn from a	J
man who wrote, in his well-known Letter to Jean Coc-	j
teau:
“Oui' business is to find the positive in all things; to
use what is true less to strike than to cure. There is
so little love in the world; men's hearts are so cold, so
frozen, even in people who are right — the only ones
who could help the others. One must have a hard
mind and a meek heart. Not couxxting soft minds with
dry hearts, the world is almost entirely made up of
hard minds with dry hearts and meek hearts with soft
minds.'’

Professor Maritain (center) confers with (L. to R.)
Victor Schaefer, Director of the University Library;
Prof. Joseph Evans, Director of the Maritain Cen-
ter; Rev. Herman Reith, C.S.C., head of the Phi-
losophy Department; and Professor Frank Keegan,
staff member of the new Center.

the instructing. Each school has its program, and they
participate in a May festival. During the University Sum-
mer School courses, the youngsters form a ‘demonstra-
tion’ group for graduate students. It culminates in a
concert-demonstration for pupils and graduate students
of the University as well as interested townspeople. Notes
on our experience are made available to Catholic laymen
and clergy to help them start or further develop their
own instrumental programs.
On a more advanced level a natural path of develop-
ment for these young instrumentalists is into the orchestra
and band of St. Joseph High School, South Bend, and
perhaps eventually, the recently organized Notre Dame-
St. Mary’s student orchestra, or the popular Notre Dame
Band. It is felt that there now exist enough instrumental
organizations to meet the needs and abilities of young
people of all ages and talents.
Most significant in this respect one of the develop-
ments has been the newly organized Orchestra of the Per
Musica Society, a professional chamber group of thirty-
two selected players from the locality and outlying dis-
tricts. Sponsored by Notre Dame and St. Mary’s College,
and aided by the Trust Fund of the American Federation
The author has been a member of the Notre Dame fa-
culty since 1947. He was educated at Potsdam State
Teachers College, Columbia Teachers College and the
Chicago Musical College. Professor Biondo received a
doctorate in music education in 1950 and has written
numerous articles in various publications. He is a veteran
of World War II and was discharged as a Lt.-Com-
mander from the U. S. Navy.
of Musicians, it is capable of performing professional
concerts of the highest order. These musicians, for exam-
ple, play such difficult compositions as that of the Baroque
and Modem eras. Flexibility of style and chamber in-
strumentation is possible inasmuch as the orchestra is
often divided into miscellaneous smaller ensembles to per-
form seldom heard works that deserve more recognition.
As a matter of fact, it was for this organization that Rev.
Carl Hager, C.S.C., head ol the Music Department, wrote
an overture which was received with a tremendous ova-
tion at its initial performance.
Plans for further expansion are underway to reach
more schools and more youngsters in the local community,
as well as on the national scene, and to improve condi-
tions in the instrumental training program in Catholic
education generally.
