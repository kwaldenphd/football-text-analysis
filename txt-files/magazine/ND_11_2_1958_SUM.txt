Notre Dame
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh,
C.S.C., is Notre Dame’s six-
teenth President.
Every great civilization grew out of
a challenge. Insofar as its response to
the challenge was vital, the particular
civilization grew and prospered. To the
extent that it failed to meet the con-
tinuing challenge, each civilization in
turn declined until today we find only
in the pages of history, and on the
carved surfaces of monuments, the
glories of most classical cultures, now
long since deceased.
The challenges that have faced great
civilizations were normally dual in
character: physical challenges and
spiritual challenges. For example, the
great Egyptian civilization met the
physical challenge of survival by chang-
ing broad miasmic swamp lands into
the fertile valley of the Nile. But the
Pharaohs failed in the larger spiritual
challenge of bringing social justice to
their people. It was the work of slaves,
not free men, that built the pyramids.
Little did the rulers realize that they
were not only building magnificent
tombs for themselves, but for their
civilization as well.
We have seen the ebb and flow of
physical and spiritual challenges in this
country as well as in this University.
The pioneers conquered the West, the
railroads spanned the great continental
plains, bridged the rivers, and crossed
the Rockies. Technology completed
the task so that today we race the sun
across the land, and talk from coast-
to-coast as easily as from room-to-room.
Yes, the physical challenge of survival,
the additional challenges of space and
time have been met, but what of the
deeper challenges of the spirit?
We know that our history here at
the University, in the light of the physi-
cal challenges of survival, paralleled
that of our country. One hundred and
sixteen years ago, Father Sorin arrived
here after more than a week’s arduous
journey from nearby Vincennes, Indi-
ana. His total assets were some bleak
land, a drafty log cabin, an oxcart full
of goods, and less than $400 in cash.
More important, no doubt, even in
meeting the physical challenges, were
the consecrated lives of his companions,
the vision of faith, hope, and charity in
his own stalwart heart.
He had more than his share of pesti-
lence and plague, fire and drought, dis-
appointments and deaths in those early
years. But he made a vital response to
each challenge, he grew with America,
and added to the strong fiber of this
country’s growth.
What are the challenges of the spirit
that face our civilization, our country,
and our University today? Certainly,
a prime challenge is the need for wis-
dom, not merely the pragmatic pru-
dence of day-by-day decisions, but the
age-old Christian wisdom that under-
stands the whole pattern of creation
and man’s place in this pattern. Our
work is the perfecting of human beings,
drawing out and developing all the
human potentialities of our students.
While the imparting of universal
knowledge is the specific function of
the University, yet we have ever been
interested here in the total perfection
of our students. Knowledge does not
exist in a vacuum, but in a person who
lives and moves and acts. A person’s
isolated and unrelated knowledge of
specific facts may remain sterile, but
wisdom leads a man to face the hurly-
burly task of daily living with the
peaceful and calm assurance of where
he is going, and of the way of attaining
the ultimate goals. This is why we do
not call a man wise merely because he
is learned in this or that field. To know
wisely, is to know all that one knows
in proper order and perspective. To
be educated in this wisdom is to know
how and why to love God. We who
presume to educate young men could
not aspire to less than this sort of wis-
dom ourselves. And who is better pre-
pared to educate others than he who
himself possesses the riches of Christian
wisdom? The whole wide world is his
to impart, and God is at the very heart
of this world, to be known and loved.
May all of us be ever more wise at
Notre Dame.

tory of polio. But stranger yet, there
also began a willing career in suffering
in our machine age, a career of resigna-
tion that is still affecting the lives of
Bev. Francis Walsh
By
This article was published in the
“Queen of All Hearts” magazine, an
official publication of the Montfort
Fathers, Bayshore, N. Y. Permission
has been given to reprint it in the cur-
rent issue of Notre Dame.
I think Frederick B. Snite, Jr., would
be pleased to see his name and part
of his story appear in a magazine de-
dicated to the honor of Our Lady. In
his lifetime, he received a great deal
of publicity, much of which he ac-
cepted silently as a kind of penance.
The one thing, however, he never
shied away from was the chance to
make known publicly the goodness of
God. He never passed up an oppor-
tunity to make the point that he and
Our Lady were on the best of terms.
He would encourage this attempt to
tell something of her profound in-
fluence in his life.
Although he is dead three years, mil-
lions of people in this country and
abroad recognize the name of Fred-
erick Snite and immediately associate
it with courage and suffering and vic-
tory. His biography, “The Man In
The Iron Lung,” written by his friend
and attendant of many years, Leonard
G. Hawkins, in collaboration with Mil-
ton Lomask, had a wide sale in this
country and recently was translated
into French.
From the day the news flashed out
of China that a twenty-six-year-old
American, had contracted bulbar polio-
myelitis, in Peiping, while on a world
tour, and was struggling for life sealed
in a weird looking machine, people
everywhere were interested.
At that time hardly anyone had even
heard of an iron lung. It is said there
was but one in all of Asia. Provi-
dentially it was not being used. They
put Fred in it, and thus began one of
the strangest medical cases in the his-
many.
God had given Fred Snite the voca-
tion of suffering. It was to last far
beyond the most optimistic guesses of
doctors. But to Fred, in the beginning,
even a day at a time was almost more
than he could bear.
In the strange atmosphere of China,
unable to understand the language of
the nurses or to express himself, aware
of the honest doubt in the faces of
others, plagued night and day by the
noise of the iron coflin as the mechan-
ism clanked and the bellows wheezed,
incapable for months of swallowing
even a drop of water without intense
pain — it all seemed too much for a
human being to bear.
He soon realized two things — he
would have to depend on others for
even the simplest needs; his very life
would always depend on the un-
impeded flow of electricity.
From the beginning his faith in God’s
mysterious ways remained firm. His
silent pleas to Our Lady went up daily.
He was bracing himself for a long
journey with the cross.

to ask God to give me the strength to
live in this tank for the rest of my life.
If it’s God’s will that I be cured, I will
be. If not, I won’t; obviously He has
other plans for me.”
In that much publicized trip he prob-
ably did more to make known the
wonderful story of Our Lady’s work in
Lourdes to non-Catholic Americans
than anyone else in our times. People
of all faiths followed him every leg of
the journey, as it was reported daily in
the papers. Many who had thought
miracles impossible or relics of the
ancient past, were openly disappointed
when he returned home still confined
to his metal prison.
Our Lady, however, had not ignored
lais heroic pilgrimage. There is no
doubt he was favored there with an
It lasted eighteen years. When he
died on November 12, 1954, he was
still front page news. Time magazine
said his death “ended perhaps the most
famed fight an American has ever made
to stay alive and to enjoy life against
terrible odds.” Much more was written
about his courage, the inspiration he
gave others, the light and strength his
example carried to the troubled and
the handicapped.
What they wrote was true. But the
papers and magazines could only tell
a part of it — the external part. Only
a few knew where lay the hidden
sources he was tapping to keep from
despair and cynicism. As a life-long,
fervent Catholic, he realized his “help
was in the name of the Lord.” He
used the Mass and the Sacraments as
God intended them to be used, trans-
forming helps, supernatural aids. Get-
ting the lung into a church for Sunday
Mass was no mean expedition, but he
never missed. He regretted he could
receive Holy Communion only several
times a week.
These are the basic supports that
carried him along. The faith gave him
the long-range viewpoint whereby he
measured everything by the great goal
beyond this life, the vision to see some-
thing on the other side so beautiful and
compelling that any amount of pain
and deprivation represented a small
price.
But even this does not tell it all by
any means. The role of Our Lady in
the life of Fred Snite fills out the pic-
ture and explains many things otherwise
confusing. It seems very clear to us
now that our Blessed Mother had al-
ways had a special design on him. She
seems to have prepared him well from
childhood on for the apostolate he was
to carry on in her honor.
He was born into a Catholic home
where the faith was held in reverence
by both parents, where devotion to
Our Lady was accepted as natural. He
could have gone to any college, but he
chose Notre Dame. And the great gold
statue of Our Lady high on the dome
of the Administration Building there
reminded him for several years that she
was to have a part not only in his edu-
cation, but in all the affairs of his life.
In his quest of God, he traveled with
Mary all the way, perhaps somewhat
vaguely in his early youth, but certainly
proudly as a collegian, and then by
deliberate choice in the latter years of
his affliction after plunging into the
True Devotion.
Apparently early in his confinement
in the iron lung, Fred came to as-
sociate the solution of future problems
with the special help of Our Lady.
This was the reason for his famed
journey to Lourdes in the respirator.
It was a fantastic undertaking, try-
ing to move a man enclosed in an
awkward machine a distance of ten
thousand miles without ever permitting
the flow of electricity to stop for more
than a few seconds. Going to Lourdes
involved almost as much nerve wrack-
ing attention to details as did the
earlier trip from Peiping to Chicago.
But Fred was convinced he had to go
as a pilgrim to Lourdes. Was it be-
cause he was frantically searching for
a cure? By then was he ready to snatch
at any fragment of hope? His biogra-
phers quote him as saying to a priest
friend: “So I want to go to Lourdes
extraordinary gift. Fred often men-
tioned that he came up from the
piercingly cold waters of the baths at
Lourdes with complete peace and un-
reserved resignation. He came away
with a reserve of strength that was to
carry him along the way of the cross
for fifteen years. Some of Mary’s
greatest miracles at Lourdes are the in-
visible wonders worked in the soul.
Fred felt she had made his trip a suc-
cess. He received what he had desired.
Within a short while, he was blessed
in other ways that provided consider-
able happiness over the years. He mar-
ried Teresa Larkin, a girl who shared
his faith and all of his life, who was
also willing to let God have His way
with human life. They were given
three daughters — long after almost
everyone had counted him out.
Five or six years before his death, he
made the act of Consecration to Mary
as outlined by St. Louis De Montfort
in his treatise on the True Devotion.
This came about, strange as it sounds,
because of Fred’s growing conviction
that he was not doing enough for God.
He wanted to avoid mere passive ac-
ceptance of his affliction. Grace had
brought him to the point of making
him restless to do more. He was
anxious to make a more complete of-
fering of himself to God. He was so
far over the hump of adjustment that
he often said if God gave him the
choice of getting well or staying in the
lung, he would hold fast to the cross.
And yet he felt compelled to do more.
Fred had solid faith, but that did
not keep his sharp mind from wanting
answers. He took nothing for granted
in working out the background of the
Vol. II • No. I II
consecration. Looking at him through
the mirror, you could see his eyes grow
serious as he spoke slowly with the help
of the machine: “I don’t see how I can
still pray for others, if I give all I have
to Our Lady. What about all those
people I promised to pray for?” Again:
“I can see now how true devotion takes
away nothing from God, but rather
gives honor to Him. But how can I
explain that convincingly to others?”
Or: “I don’t see how in ‘doing all
things for and with Mary’ I can think
of her in every action.” “What’s a good,
brief, meaty answer for my Protestant
friends who tell me it is more perfect
to go directly to God?” The classes
went on once or twice a week over a
period of several months.
He put so much effort into it, I
think, because he realized how impor-
tant it was to know the solid doctrine
behind the Church’s claims concerning
Our Lady. I remember him saying that
merely to read the act of Consecration
would not do him any good. The thing
is to live it every hour.
As he kept studying and thinking,
the details of the wondrous picture of
Our Lady as painted by De Montfort
were filled in. St. Augustine’s striking
thought that the faithful followers of
Christ “are in this world hidden in the
womb of the most holy Virgin, where
they are guarded, nourished, brought
up . . . ” enabled him to sense the
depth of our dependence on Mary in
God’s plan.
He deepened his conviction that
Mary, as Mother of the Mystical Body,
became our true Mother, and we de-
pend on her, as the mold of God, to
form Jesus in us.
God had forced Fred to surrender
his independence physically. He was
the most dependent of men, so much
so that if even a fly bothered him, he
did not have the strength of an infant’s
hand to brush it away. Even for a
sip of water, someone had to be present.
But when it came to acknowledging
his spiritual dependence, he was free
to refuse. Once he realized how God
has made us all dependent upon Mary,
he could not wait to live out that de-
pendence as her slave and to tell others
about it.
On the Feast of the Annunciation,
Fred Snite prepared for his act of
Consecration, as a novice goes forward
for profession. We sat alone in a small
room on the second floor of his home.
The nurse sat just beyond the glass
door, ready to come if needed. He
insisted on saying out loud every word
of the long act, not an easy thing to do.
He read with the characteristic pauses
forced on him by the action of the
bellows providing him breath for the
next phrase.
His first reaction was that others
had to have the same blessing. He had
long talked it over with Tessie and
with his sister, Mary Loretta. Both of
them in time followed his example.
Tessie reports that at least ten or
twelve people in Minocqua were led
to make the consecration after Fred
gave them the books and enkindled
their enthusiasm. No one knows how
many non-Catholics during bridge
games or in informal chats learned
about Oui' Lady through him.
The consecration had remarkable ef-
fects on him. It did not make any
external change. But he felt in putting
Lourdes Indulgences Granted by Holy See
GROTTO: Throughout the Lourdes
Centenary Year every visit to the
Notre Dame Grotto merits these in-
dulgences accorded by the Holy See:
1.	A Plenary Indulgence is granted
for each visit made by a group (5 or 6)
of the faithful who have duly confessed
their sins and received Communion,
and who pray for the intention of the
Holy Father {Pater, Ave, Gloria}.
2.	A Partial Indulgence of seven
o
years is granted to any individual who
visits the Grotto with suitable dispo-
sitions of mind and heart {Pater, Ave,
Gloria}.
CONFRATERNITY: Other Indul-
gences can be gained throughout your
lifetime by membership in the Con-
fraternity of the Immaculate Concep-
tion of Our Lady of Lourdes at Notre
Dame. Benefits include Lourdes water,
intentions in Mass every Saturday on
the campus, and a plenary indulgence
under the ordinary conditions (Con-
fession, Communion, etc.) on the day
of admission, at the hour of death, and
each year on several feasts of the
Blessed Virgin plus, by recent Vatican
decision, the Feast of St. Bernadette,
Feb. 18. Address: Lourdes, Notre
Dame, Indiana.
PAPAL PRAYER: During the cen-
tenary of the Marian apparitions a
partial indulgence of three years can be
all in Mary’s hands, he had nothing
left to give, he was doing all that he
could. His peace deepened in intimacy
with Mary, as he was more convinced ’
than ever that his iron lung was his
“passport to heaven,” that Our Lady
was using him as an instrument of
good for the salvation of others.	'

Special Prayer to
Our Lady of Lourdes
Heeding your voice, O Immaculate
Virgin of Lourdes, we hasten to your
feet at the humble grotto where you
deigned to appear to show the way of
prayer and penitence to those astray,
and to dispense to the stricken the
graces and wonders of your unsurpassed
kindness.
Receive, O Merciful Queen, the
praise and supplications which peoples
and nations, oppressed by bitterness and
anxiety, trustfully raise to you.
O fair vision of paradise, banish the
darkness of error from our minds with
the light of faith! O Mystical Rose,
relieve crushed souls with the heavenly
fragrance of hope! O inexhaustible
source of healing waters, revive barren
hearts with the flow of divine love!
Grant that all of us, your sons and

12 Notre Dame
The author has been dean of the
Notre Dame Law School since 1952.
A native of Ohio, he received his A.B.
from Xavier University and his LL.B,
from the University of Cincinnati.
Admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1921, he
was in private practice in Cincinnati
before accepting his present post.
Dean O’Meara’s article originally ap-
peared in the American Bar Associa-
tion Journal. Permission has been
granted to reprint extracts of it in
Notre Dame.
“There has been altogether too much
copy work, too much patchwork, and
too little original thinking in the formu-
lation of objectives and programs in
the law schools.” Those words by John
G. Hervey, Adviser to the Section of
Legal Education and Admissions to the
Bar, are a challenge to the law schools
of the country to take a long look at
what they are doing and how they are
doing it — and why. After just such
a scrutiny, the Notre Dame Law
School inaugurated a new instructional
program in 1953.
There are two points which are basic
to our approach to legal education. In
the first place, Notre Dame is and in-
tends to remain a small school and our
program of legal education is keyed
to that fact. Not all the advantages
are on the side of being big. There are
real advantages in being small. For
one thing, it is possible in a small
school to treat the individual student
as an individual. But the advantages,
the distinctive potentialities of small-
ness, must be recognized and culti-
vated; they are dissipated if one is pre-
occupied with imitating bigness.
The second point is our conception
of legal education as a joint and co-
operative undertaking. Our program
reflects the thesis that, given things as
they are in this harried and hurried
present-day world, best results are
achieved not by individual sorties but
by a concerted attack upon the educa-
tional problem by the faculty working
as a team, to the end that each course
will play its assigned role in a co-
ordinated pedagogical campaign. This
is of the essence.
The Curriculum . . .
A Prescribed Program
The business of a law school is to
make lawyers — “great lawyers,” as
Mr. Justice Holmes insisted. This we
can do to best advantage, we believe,
by discarding electives and offering, in-
stead, a prescribed program of instruc-

Training Lawyers
for Leadership
By Dean Joseph O’Meara, Jr.
tion; and we have done so, thus mak-
ing it possible for every course to build
on the foundation laid in courses al-
ready taken and, in turn, to lay a solid
foundation for courses yet to be taken.
Our reasons for discarding electives
have been summarized as follows:
The elective system . . . proceeds
on a fallacy, [and] in practice . . .
involves many absurdities. I recall
hearing ... of a student who never
took a course above the second floor.
And there is not only a spatial, there
is also a temporal principle of selec-
tion at work: students have told me
they made it a point never to sign up
for a course given before 9:30 in the
morning. In other ways, as well, the
elective system tends to coddle stu-
dents; it encourages them to choose
what are thought to be snap courses
and instructors with a reputation for
marking high.
Moreover the elective system is at
war with one of our obligations,
namely, to train lawyers for responsi-
ble leadership. This means that our
graduates must have a rounded and
balanced legal education; and this,
in turn, means that they must have
training in areas which, left to their
own devices, many would pass by.
I must make it plain, though, that
we do not necessarily exclude the pos-
sibility of fruitful use of electives on a
limited scale in the final year of law
study. We recognize an obligation to
cultivate not only breadth of view but,
equally, depth of understanding; and
it may be that depth of understanding
is facilitated by allowing the student
some choice of courses in his final year.
For us that remains an open question.
In any case, we reject the notion
that specialization can be undertaken
profitably before a student has obtained
Vol. II • No. I
13
his LL.B. The customary three years
of law school afford little enough time
for the thorough grounding in the fun-
damentals of the major areas of law
which every lawyer ought to have.
How best to provide this thorough
grounding? That, in our view, is the
critical question. Can it be said that
any selection of courses taken in any
order will do the job as well as any
other? We think not. This seems to
us to demonstrate the advisability of
an integrated program of legal studies;
and the formulation of such a program,
obviously, can only be the responsibility
of the faculty.
Like the law itself, our required
curriculum is not a finished product.
It is kept under constant surveillance
to the end that no opportunity will
be overlooked to make it mesh more
perfectly with the responsibilities and
opportunities of practice. No matter
how well we succeed in that, however,
we know that lasting success is im-
possible. For the law is alive and grow-
ing. As it grows and changes, corres-
ponding changes in oui' curriculum will
be called for. We will be alert to make
them.
Methods of Instruction . . .
An Institutional Approach
No less important than the “what”
is the “how” of legal education, and
Notre Dame has adopted an institu-
tional approach to method as well as
to content.
Our primary insistence is upon
maximizing student participation in
the educational process. The common
law is not merely or essentially a body
of knowledge. It is, rather, a way
of approaching problems, a method of
dealing with concrete situations, a
technique; and it can be learned only
by practice.
In the first year we emphasize in-
tensive training in analysis through
rigorous use of the case method. What
do I mean by rigorous use of the case
method? Every case considered in class
is the subject of many questions, spe-
cific questions, searching questions by
the instructor. Not all of them are
put to a single student; rather, each
question is, in general, put to a different
student or to several different students;
for the object is to draw the whole
class, not this or that member of it,
into a Socratic dialogue with the in-
structor. Thus no student can doze or
daydream or prepare the next case
while one of his classmates is reciting.
o
Any student is likely to be called on
at any moment; and it is our purpose
to let no class period go by without
bringing every student into the discus-
sion several times.
Not many cases can be treated thus
exhaustively in a class period. This
does not seem to us to matter. Spend-
ing the whole class period on a single
case may be the most economical use
of time — so long as the cases for dis-
cussion are selected from the assign-
ment in such a way that the students
do not anticipate them and limit their
preparation accordingly.
We are not disturbed by the fact
that, using this approach, it is impos-
sible to cover in class all the material
in the case book. The cases for class
discussion are selected on the same
principle. Beyond this, we recommend
a standard text in each course to help
the student develop a coherent view
of the subject as a whole.
At Notre Dame we are convinced
that lecturing to students is not the
best way to make lawyers. When lec-
tures are relied on, the wrong man is
doing the work. I say this to our stu-
dents to try to get across to them what
I mean by that. “Suppose at practice
time the members of the football squad
lined up along the edge of the field and
the coach practiced running and punt-
ing and tackling and blocking. If he
did all of the practicing and the mem-
bers of the squad just stood and looked
on, what kind of team do you think
you would have?”
Every virtue, pressed too far, be-
comes a vice. So it may not be liter-
ally true that the function of a teacher
is to ask rather than to answer ques-
tions, but it very nearly is. As a matter
of institutional policy, therefore, we
emphasize intensive training in analysis
through rigorous use of the case method
in the first year.
Preoccupation with close analysis of
cases, if continued beyond the first year,
leads to boredom on the part of stu-
dents. Moreover, it’s not enough to
know how to read cases and extract
therefrom what Cardozo called the
“kernel.” Much more is required: a
lawyer must be able to use cases in the
resolution of concrete controversies.
This is an art and, as such, requires
long practice. In the second and third
years, therefore, as a matter of insti-
tutional policy, we leave the case
method and emphasize, instead, the
problem method, which is just what its
name implies — the method whereby
students learn law by using it in work-
ing out concrete legal problems.
Members of the faculty teaching
second- and third-year courses concen-
trate in class on problems carefully
worked out and mimeographed in ad-
vance. The problems are of such na-
ture that a student is wholly unable to
cope with them unless he has read and
mastered his casebook assignment, but
the class period is devoted to the prob-
lems rather than to the assigned ma-
terial in the casebook.
How does our use of problems in
the classroom differ from the hypo-
thetical questions with which every law
student long has been familiar? For

Dean Joseph O’Meara, Jr.
one thing, the conventional hypotheti-
cal begins where the discussion of a
particular case leaves off, changing this
or that fact or circumstance in order
to illustrate the instructor’s discourse
upon the genesis and development and,
perhaps, the probable future direction
of a given rule of law. Our problems,
on the contrary, are problems in their
own right, not merely appendages to
a particular case in the book. They
are stated in full circumstantial detail;
and contain, by design, an admixture
of irrelevant facts and circumstances.
Their solution may require a grasp not
of this or that case only but of every
case in the assignment and, indeed, of
cases in earlier assignments as well.
Thus they are not designed merely to
illustrate points made by the instructor.
They are intended to be grappled with
14
Notre Dame
and worked out by the students, on
their own, on the basis of what they
should have gotten out of the assigned
material.
Again, as in the first year, the con-
stant purpose is to draw the whole class
into a Socratic dialogue with the in-
structor, whose principal task, now as
then, is to ask penetrating questions —
questions which will stimulate inde-
pendent thinking by the students.
In addition to the problems thus
discussed in class, research problems
are assigned which the student must
report on in writing. He has one such
research problem in each second-year
course. The assignments are made ac-
cording to a schedule prepared by the
second-year instructors, working in col-
laboration, so that the student is al-
ways at work on a research problem
but never confronted by two or more
at once.
In the third year only one research
problem is assigned. The student is re-
quired to make a thorough study of
a live legal problem, selected by him
in consultation with a member of the
faculty, and to write an acceptable re-
port on it. The emphasis here is on
research in depth.
Legal Writing . . .
A Lost Art
The research problems have another
advantage. They give the student prac-
tice in effective legal writing, seemingly
almost a lost art.
Thus at Notre Dame we pass from
a case-method emphasis on analysis in
the first year to a problem-method
emphasis on synthesis in the second and
third years; in other words, from learn-
ing how to master cases to learning how
to master concrete legal problems.
It is evident that large classes would
make it impossible to carry out effec-
tively the program I have been describ-
ing. Hence we are committed to small
classes. I am not sure what the opti-
mum size is. At present our working
hypothesis is that a class of thirty-five
to forty is small enough for active stu-
dent participation and yet large enough
to insure adequate competition. So far
as possible, therefore, we restrict the
number of students in a class to ap-
proximately thirty-five. This is ac-
complished by dividing larger classes
into sections.
To make law intelligible to students,
it is broken down into courses. Though
the generally accepted categories, it
may be, could be improved, some such
fragmentation is obviously necessary.
But it has disadvantages and they are
very great. Students think in terms of
one course at a time and have the
utmost difficulty in seeing from one
subject to another.
At Notre Dame we have instituted
a system of comprehensive examina-
tions. Course examinations at the end
of each semester are still given, though
0	5	o
the customary procedure has been
modified to the extent that each exami-
nation contains questions from several
courses and there is no label putting
the student on notice that a particular
question has to do with a particular
course. The comprehensive examina-
tions are in addition to the course
examinations. Except in the first year,
each comprehensive examination covers
the work of three semesters; and each
comprehensive question involves more
than one course. Thus a single ques-
tion will involve, for example, torts and
agency, or contracts and corporations,
or jurisdiction, procedure and evidence.
Just about every question that con-
fronts a practitioner is a comprehensive
question in that it involves more than
one of the traditional legal categories.
Yet the conventional law school exami-
nation question is addressed to a single
subject only, a subject that is identified
for the student in advance. Suppose
the medical schools addressed them-
selves to the cure of disease on the as-
sumption that a patient never has more
than one illness at a time and, there-
fore, that the role of the physician is
to cope with a single disorder only in an
otherwise healthy person. Would not
that seem unrealistic? On the same
principle, we have concluded that com-
prehensive examinations are a valuable
teaching tool.
Our comprehensive examinations
give great importance to systematic
and continuous review; and this, in
turn, helps to bring subjects already
covered into juxtaposition with those
currently under study. Thus both the
comprehensive questions themselves
and the review they make necessary
facilitate and deepen the student’s un-
derstanding by helping him to see the
law as an organic whole rather than
as a succession of unrelated courses.
Legal Education . . .
Training for Leadership
At Notre Dame we believe that law
schools must face up to the great ques-
tions concerning the nature of man

and society, the origin and purpose of
law and the lawyer’s role in society.
These questions are given searching
examination in our curriculum, par-
ticularly in a course on the history of
the legal profession in the first year, a
natural law seminar in the second year
and a course on jurisprudence in the
third year. The first of these is without
counterpart, so far as I know, in any
other American law school.
The Notre Dame Law School system-
atically endeavors to illuminate the
great jurisprudential issues which, es-
pecially in this fateful age, insistently
press for answer; and to make clear
the ethical principles and inculcate the
ideals which should actuate a lawyer.
The School believes that a lawyer is
best served, and the community as
well, if he possesses not only legal
knowledge and legal skills but also a
profound sense of the ethics of his pro-
fession — and something else which the
curriculum is likewise designed to cul-
tivate: pride in the legal profession
and a fierce partisanship for justice.
The merit of the Notre Dame pro-
gram of legal education in our view,
O	O	5
consists in the drawing together of its
component parts into a coherent, pur-
poseful, institutional program dedicated
to the training of lawyers who are at
once skilled craftsmen and equipped
for effective leadership at a critical
juncture in the affairs of men.
