A
ESTATE
The ‘Estate Planning3 story in the
NOTRE DAME, Summer, 1957 issue
created much interest among alumni
and non-alumni friends. It was thought
that an additional article would prove
helpful in answering the numerous in-
quiries received by the Foundation
office. William J. McNamara, a Notre
Dame alumnus who is an estate plan-
ning specialist in Chicago, prepared the
following information. Mr. McNamara
received a bachelor’s degree from the
University in 1939 and an LL.B, the
next year.
Estate Planning for every thinking
individual, and especially for the
friends and alumni of the University of
Notre Dame, is of great importance
today. Our fathers and grandfathers
did not have the fruits of their labors
siphoned off as we do today with
excessive income tax and other Federal,
State, County and City taxes while
living, and Federal Estate Tax, State
Inheritance or Estate Taxes, and Pro-
bate and administrative costs after our
death. Today there are taxes on every-
thing. When a tax is due, we are
morally bound to pay it. But we also
have a legal, as well as moral duty, to
ourselves and our families to arrange
our affairs so as to minimize the taxes
we must pay while living and the taxes
our estates will have to pay after our
death.
The planning required on present
day estates has been put beyond the
capacity of the average individual, and
because of the complexities involved,
Estate Planning has become the realm
of a small group of specialists. The
reasons are obvious when we realize
the complexities of modem business,
finance and taxation as they exist to-
day. These complexities require that
the estate planning specialist be a law-
yer, who is familiar with all phases of
taxation affecting estates, and a special-
ist in Wills; Trusts—inter vivos and
testamentary; Gifts; Property—real and
personal; all forms of business struc-

ture; Contracts—particularly those con-
trolling the transmission of business
interests; and he must have a practical
knowledge of all phases of life in-
surance and annuity contracts, and
know the practices of the individual
companies that issue them.
Obviously, there is no set formula
by which the Estate Planning specialist
can take any particular estate and
apply to it a standardized procedure
for saving taxes and for distributing the
estate most effectively and economi-
cally. No single plan provides the “cure-
all” for all estate ills. In fact, in most
cases, the problem will involve weighing
the relative advantages and disadvan-
tages of several possible procedures in an
effort to determine which arrangement
can bring the minimum taxes and ad-
ministrative costs with the maximum
benefits and achievement of the in-
dividual’s objectives.
Many possibilities exist for effecting
economies and savings in estate taxes
and transfer costs. A partial check list
of procedures involving potential sav-
ings in the field of Estate Planning is
as follows:
1.	Change the beneficiary designation
on present Life Insurance from being
payable to the estate of the Insured
to individual beneficiaries.
a. This procedure will reduce pro-
bate and administrative costs; will
frequently save on state inherit-
ance tax costs; and will, in most
instances, provide an exemption
from the claims of creditors of the
insured.
2.	In many estates there are items in
the general estate which do not
produce an income, are not being
held for growth; in other words, dead
weight. These items should be con-
verted to income producing items
or the funds from the sale thereof
be put into Life Insurance premiums
payable to named beneficiaries.
a. Items in the general estate which
do not produce an income are in
most instances sold at a substantial
loss if there is not sufficient
liquidity in the estate to pay final
taxes and costs.
3.	Provision for adequate amounts of
Life Insurance so as to “discount”
the potential estate liabilities for the
estate instead of from the estate.
a. The Life Insurance premiums will
seldom, if ever, equal the amount
of liabilities that can be retired
from the cash proceeds at death.
This will also prevent forced sale
of estate assets, and thus reduce
the ultimate shrinkage in estate
values. This will reduce admin-
istrative costs by making it pos-
sible to settle the estate’s affairs
more simply, with less disturbance
and difficulty, and in a shorter
period of time. This will also make
it possible to take advantage of
cash discounts for prompt pay-
ment of state inheritance taxes,
allowed under the laws of many
states.
4.	The preparation and execution of a
suitable Last Will and Testament.
a. Only through the execution of a
carefully prepared Will can pro-
bate expenses and death taxes be
held to a minimum. Before any
competent attorney can draw a
Last Will and Testament, he must
know all the facts of the indi-
vidual’s general estate, as well as
all the facts pertaining to the in-
dividual’s estate in Life Insurance,
and furthermore he must know
the full facts pertaining to the
estate of the spouse, and I even
insist upon knowing the full facts
pertaining to the estates of any of
the testator’s children, who have
started to accumulate a substantial
estate in their own right. Only
in this manner can the attorney
be sure that the maximum estate
tax marital deduction will be ob-
tained, if desired, and achieve pos-
sible savings in taxes on the death
of the testator, the spouse, and/or
children of the testator.
5.	Creation of a revocable living trust.
a.	In many estates where the indi-
vidual has an income from his
business interests in excess of his
needs, and also has considerable
income from stocks and bonds,
which added income puts him in a
higher income tax bracket, it is
often recommended that a living
trust be created for a minimum
period of at least ten (10) years.
The income from this trust could
be paid to one or more of his
children, who are in a lower in-
come tax bracket, or could be
paid during the period of the
trust directly to a charity or edu-
cational institution., such as the
University of Notre Dame, or di-
rect the trust to purchase a Life
Insurance policy, on his life, 10
or 15 Payment Life Plan, depend-
ing on the length of the trust, and
for the trust to absolutely assign
the policy by Gift to the charity
or educational institution, such as
the University of Notre Dame.
b.	This would not cost the donor very
much, if anything at all, because it
would allow him to retain that much
more of his income from his busi-
ness interests because it would lower
his income tax bracket.
c.	Also, depending upon circum-
stances, there could be a substan-
tial savings in Probate costs, etc.
6.	Placing title to property in names
of estate owner and wife jointly, with
right of survivorship.
a.	With respect to certain types of
property, depending on the facts,
particularly bank and savings ac-
counts, and the home, advantages
exist in having title to the property
placed in the name of husband
and wife jointly with right of sur-
vivorship. One advantage is that
the property passes automatically
to the survivor at the death of
either party, thus avoiding pro-
bate and administrative costs and
delays. Another advantage is that
such property automatically quali-
fies for the allowable marital de-
duction to the extent that it is
included in the estate of the first
spouse to die, thus to that extent
a potential saving of federal estate
taxes.
b.	Savings in some states may also be
achieved on state inheritance
taxes.
7.	Execution of agreement covering
purchase and sale of business in-
terests in the estate.
a. In many estates, substantial prob-
lems will arise at the death of the
estate owner in the effort to estab-
lish a proper value for business
interests (proprietorship, partner-
ship or close corporation) in his
estate. Where such interests have
no well-established market value,
considerable and expensive litiga-
tion can result from the attempt
by the Government to establish the
value. However where the busi-
ness interest is covered by a bind-
ing buy-and-sell agreement, re-
quiring its sale by the estate at a
stipulated price or a price arrived
at in accordance with a definite
formula, after the present owner’s
death, that price will control for
federal estate tax purposes. Such
an agreement may consequently
result in a tax savings by avoiding
an unwarranted high valuation for
estate tax purposes under some
arbitrary formula, as well as pro-
bate costs savings inherent in the
avoidance of a prolonged dispute
over the proper value for federal
estate tax purposes.
8.	Establishment of definite domicile.
a. Estate owners of some wealth fre-
quently maintain an actual domi-
cile and home in one state, with
a temporary residence in some
other state. Sometimes, for income
or other tax purposes, actual resi-
dence will be maintained in one
state and legal residence in an-
other. Under existing; court deci-
sions, such a situation involves
danger of inheritance taxation by
both such states on the bases of
domicile. It is important today
that estate owners make certain
that their domicile is clearly estab-
lished in one state, to avoid pos-
sible duplication of state inherit-
ance taxes.
9.	Re-examination of trusts in other
states.
a. Under present court decisions where
a man living in one estate creates a
trust, and places property in the
hands of a trustee in another state
where the trust is administered, there
is danger of taxation of the property
in this trust by both states. The
laws of both states with respect
to the taxation of intangible prop-
erty must be examined carefully
if such double state inheritance
tax is to be avoided.
10.	Use of living gifts of estate property
directly and by Irrevocable trust.
a. It is possible to reduce estate
taxes and probate costs by trans-
ferring property during the pres-
ent owner’s lifetime instead of at
his death. These gifts may
involve—
I.	Outright gifts to individuals;
II.	Gifts in trusts;
III.	Gifts of Life Insurance. The
1954 Internal Revenue Code
eliminated the premium pay-
ment rule and hence it is
now possible for an individ-
ual to give or assign by gift
an existing Life Insurance
policy or policies on his life
to his wife, his children or
others and though he con-
tinues to pay the premiums,
these life insurance policies
will not be included in his
estate for federal estate tax
purposes upon his death.
IV.	A series of small gifts within
the annual gift tax exemp-
tion, and
V.	Gifts to the University of
Notre Dame are free of any
gift tax and moreover can
be an Income Tax deduction
of up to 30% of the indi-
vidual’s “adjusted gross in-
come” for the fiscal year in
which it was made.
The above are but a few of the items
the Estate Planning specialist must take
into consideration when analyzing an
estate. His recommendations must be
based on the client’s facts and objec-
tives for his family and/or others, and
moreover present his recommendations
in such a manner that the client rec-
ognizes the problems and understands
the reasons for the particular plan of
solution recommended.
One of the ways in which each of
us, if interested, could make a substan-
tial donation to the University of Notre
Dame is through the gift of a life in-
surance policy. For example, do you
know, that if there are sufficient alumni
interested, that it is possible to get one
or more of the major Life Insurance
companies to issue individual Life In-
surance policies on a non-medical basis,
in amounts from $1,000.00 to possibly
$20,000.00, with the University of
Notre Dame as beneficiary. With the
short form application there would be
included an absolute gift assignment of
all rights, title and interests in the
policy to the University of Notre Dame.
Then all premium payments made to
the Insurance Company, including the
first payment could be an Income Tax
deduction of up to 30% of the indi-
vidual’s “adjusted gross income” de-
pending upon the amounts of the indi-
vidual’s other donations.
