Many of America’s leading business organizations have established
programs for contributing financial support to private education.
A survey on pages 2-3 of this issue reflects the tremendous inter-
est manifested by industry and business for aiding colleges and
universities in the educational progress of our nation’s youth.

limited to giving money for a research project or training of scientists or
technicians. Now more and more companies are donating outright gifts in the
form of grants with no strings attached, scholarships and other special-purpose
contributions.

automation workshop
by Gerald Dreyer
The author is business editor of the
“Indianapolis News.”
To anyone who knew Harvey P.
Rockwell as a student at Notre Dame,
it came as no great surprise when he
stepped direct from the campus into
a job with a leading instrument firm,
although at the time the nation was
in the grip of its worst depression.
Nor does the remarkable progress
he’s made since graduation seem any
more than what was expected 20
years ago of this outstanding engineer-
ing student who helped to pay his way
through school by repairing radio sets.
The successful business he now owns
is unusual in that there are few, if
any, like it in the entire country. And
it’s keyed to the most significant de-
velopment of modem industry—auto-
mation.
For Harvey Rockwell, today owner
of his own engineering firm, the Rock-
well Engineering Co., at Indianapolis,
always has demonstrated those quali-
ties which pave the way for almost
certain success. Possessor of a keen,
analytic mind, he also knows how to
meet the public, and talk to his custo-
mers as any good businessman should.
What’s more, he doesn’t permit his
superior intellect to “show” in his
dealings with customers and friends.
Doing the unusual and difficult al-
ways has been a challenge Rockwell
couldn’t resist. While at the univer-
sity, he maintained a flourishing radio
repair business, at the same time
taking an active part in class activities,
playing the clarinet in the Notre Dame
band and carrying a full academic
program. Upon graduation, he was
one of ten honor students from various
universities and colleges to be hired
as engineers by the Weston Instrument
Co. at Newark, N. J.
Rockwell Engineering Co., consist-
ing of Rockwell, two other engineers
and a master machinist, devotes its
full time to the making of devices that
help make possible the so-called auto-
matic factory.
In fact, since its beginning almost
eight years ago, the firm actually has
built all of the necessary component
parts of a completely automatic manu-
facturing plant. This includes the
motorized hand control, controlling
J	o
alarm, high-speed measuring device,
multiple test set, recorder, scanner,
pre-determined counter, programmer,
computer and indexer.
The futuristic-thinking Rockwell is
convinced that the day isn’t too far
off when the nation’s factories will be
using all or part of these devices in
their everyday manufacturing. The
fact that his firm stands ready to supply
them today is some indication of the
advanced engineering methods Rock-
well and his staff have developed.
One machine perfected by Rock-
well and being used by a large tire
tube manufacturer utilizes the prin-
ciple of the photo-electric cell. As the
tube comes from the extruding ma-
chine, its diameter is continuously
controlled, regardless of variations in
air pressure.
A device such as this, which actually
frees one man from a tedious observa-
tion job, quickly pays for itself in this
day of mass production at lowest
possible costs.
The story of Harvey Rockwell be-
gins at Rochester, N. Y., where he was
born. His family was of comfortable
means, his father being a key executive
of an office equipment firm.
Mr. Rockwell points
to a temperature scanner,
one of the precise instruments made by his engineering firm.
Rockwell and his assistant Gene Bratton
discuss the operation of a device which
frees workers from tedious adjustment jobs.
When it came time for Harvey to
be thinking about college, his father
wisely took him to several well-known
engineering schools, including Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, Rens-
selaer Polytechnic Institute, Cornell,
Michigan and the University of Roch-
ester.
He also visited the Notre Dame
campus and finally decided to come to
South Bend, largely because he was
impressed with the spirit of the student
body and because this university
seemed to him the best place to round
out his formal education. Then, too,
his fathei' thought it might be well for
Harvey’s eastern background to be
balanced by an exposure to Mid-
western culture.
Having had a year of professional
stock company work on the stage be-
fore enrolling at Notre Dame, Rockwell
knew the value of showmanship in
dealing with the public. He demon-
strated this in his spare-time radio
work by telling his student and faculty
customers, “No charge for labor, if
your radio set can’t be made to
operate better than when you bought
it.” So efficient was his work that he
didn’t have to make good that guar-
antee in a single instance.
Incidentally, it was his talent for

radio work that helped to land his
first engineering job. While attending
a radio trade convention in Chicago
a few months prior to graduation,
Rockwell happened to meet a represen-
tative of the Weston Instrument Co.
The latter had read a trade magazine
article on Rockwell’s radio repair serv-
ice. Also, Rockwell had some previous
contact with the Weston firm in prep-
aration of a thesis on indicating in-
struments.
As a result of this chance meeting
o
and Rockwell’s outstanding record
o
both in and out of the classroom, he
was hired by Weston in June, 1934,
as a $20-a-week engineer. In those
days, with millions of people on the
unemployment rolls, this was con-
sidered a good position for a young
engineering graduate.
Control - a - matic spring tester
made for the “automatic” factory.
After the usual period of training,
he was given a chance to show his sales
ability, his particular assignment being
the sale of the Weston exposure meter.
So successful were his efforts that less
than five years later, the company was
doing a million-dollar volume on this
one instrument.
In 1940, with the nation drifting
ever closer to war and the U. S.
defense machine being mobilized,
young Rockwell was called to Wash-
ington to serve on the War Production
Board. The Weston firm, which fully
appreciated the high capabilities of
Rockwell, granted him a leave of ab-
sence for this important government
assignment,
o
One of his first tasks as a member
of the WPB was the direction of pro-
duction and expansion of combat in-
struments for all types of aircraft.
Eventually, his responsibility was ex-
tended to all radio and radar com-
ponents.
While on leave of absence, he also
served briefly at Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity where he aided in the research
and development of variable time fuses
and guided missiles.
When the war ended in 1945, Rock-
well returned to non-governmental
status, this time as chief engineer for
Thomas & Skinner Steel Products Co.,
Indianapolis manufacturer of magnets
and other electrical components.
Two years later he realized a life
ambition by forming his own engineer-
ing firm with the emphasis on building
instruments that would measure and
control high production machines.
With the basement of his better-
than-average home as his workshop, he
and his skilled helpers now serve some
fifty manufacturing clients, including
some of the big names of modem in-
dustry.
Now only 42 years old, Rockwell is
married and has a son and two school-
age daughters. The growth of his
engineering business now has reached
the point where a move to larger
quarters soon must be made.
The future indeed looks bright for
Harvey Rockwell, whose contributions
to industry can only be measured in
terms of more production for less cost.
This is the American way and it’s men
like Rockwell who make it the best
economic system in the world today.
Harvey Rockwell inspects control-a-matic
spring tester which will deflect a spring
any distance down to 1/1000 of an inch.

(Ed. Note: The following extracts
are taken from the sermon given by
Father Hesburgh at the funeral of Mr.
Arch Ward, Sports Editor of the “Chi-
cago Tribune” and one of Notre
Dame’s most prominent alumni').
Every minute of every day, someone
is bom and someone dies on earth. All
of us take much of this for granted as
we pass through the middle ground of
our own lives. Occasionally a birth
touches our family and we share for a
few moments the hopes that attend
each new life that begins. Then too,
suddenly a death occurs in our circle
of friends and we pause for a moment
to assess a life that has been and is no
more on earth.
This pause that we share in common
this morning is good for all of us, even
though it is mingled with sadness and
sorrow. The very sadness and sorrow
testify that here is a life that was good,
a human presence that will be missed.
Arch Ward wrote millions of words,
spoke hundreds of thousands more, in
his lifetime. They were good words
that carried a great message to millions
of people. But the greatest message
of his career is this final word he speaks
to us today—the story of his life, what
he lived for, what he cherished, what
his life has meant.
St. Thomas Aquinas once said that
there are only three really important
endeavors in life: to have faith in the
right things, to hope for the right
things, to love the right things in life.
You could summarize all of our lives,
and Arch Ward’s too, by looking at
the things he had faith in, hoped for,
and loved.
Arch told me one day that anyone
could easily arouse him to anger by
poking fun at the three great devotions
of his life: his religion, his school, or
his paper. Take a look at each of
these, and you will see the heart of his
life.
First, his religion. There was a prac-
tical, solid quality to Arch Ward’s
Catholicism that had the character of
a squarely hit ball or a perfect play.
In a world that often neglects religion,
he lived his, and it affected everything
he did in life. It showed intimately
in his devotion to his beloved wife and
family.
He was friend to the young and old,
to Protestant, Catholic and Jew, to
colored and white, to the great of this
world and to the most humble. And
to all he gave the best gift he had to
offer—himself, and whatever he could
do for them.
Then there was his school. Notre
Dame stole his heart at an early age,
in his student days, and his passion for
Notre Dame, the school of Our Lady,
deepened with the years. He was clear
about what he had faith in, what he
hoped for, and why he loved Notre
Dame so fiercely and served her so
well.
Since the days of Rockne, everyone
President, University of Notre Dame
who has directed athletics at Notre
Dame has depended upon the sure
wisdom of Ward when there were
problems to be solved, his frank criti-
cism when things did not look right,
his courageous support whenever un-
justly attacked.
Then finally there was his paper, the
Chicago Tribune, and his profession
of sports journalism and promotion.
Here he had faith in the value of
competitive sports, hope for what it
could accomplish and has accom-
plished so uniquely in America, and he
loved the thrill of the contest, the
great heart of the champion.
In all of this, he teaches us a most
important lesson: that it matters not
so much what we do in life, but how
we do it, and for what purposes. Here
then, is the sermon that Arch Ward
preaches to us and to the world today:
that every life has eternal value if a
man will have faith in, hope for and
love the right things; that everything
good in life is a means of bringing us
to the knowledge and love and service
of God; that no other kind of life is
really worth living, for as St. August-
ine has said: “Thou hast made us for
Thyself, O Lord, and the heart of man
is restless until he rests in Thee.”

Notre Dame
{Ed. Note-. The Baccalaureate Ser-
mon preached on June 5 by Most Rev.
John J. Wright, D.D., was not only a
magnificent message to the Class of
1955, but comprehensive in its chal-
lenge to Catholic college men of all
years. As a result, the Alumni Asso-
ciation, instead of designating a Class
Reunion preacher on June 12, as is its
custom, has agreed upon Bishop
Wright1s sermon as the Alumni Sermon
for 1955, and considers it a privilege
to print it for all alumni and othei
friends of the University.')
“Behold how they are numbered
among the children of God, and their
lot is among the saints!”
Wisdom V, 5
Our sermon this day can well be
brief. It is a commonplace to remind
college graduates that they are a
privileged group. Nevertheless, I ask
you to meditate on your privileges for
just a moment. You men of Notre
Dame are privileged in more ways
than you may usually recall. You were
privileged in the circumstances of your
birth. It is a very real privilege to be
bom in America, to be born under the
physical and spiritual, the civil and
religious conditions which normally
prevail in the parts of the United
States from which most of you are
privileged to come. Despite the moods
of discouragement and disillusion
which occasionally prevail among us,
it is a very real privilege to have been
bom in this particular period of his-
tory, face to face alike with the op-
portunity for the alert and the chal-
lenge to the valiant which always exist
in a time like the present, a time of
revolution and far-reaching changes.
Most of you, I trust all of you are
privileged in the families from which
you come. Our typical college students
come from frugal, hard-working
people. In the main they do not
come from the background of that
poverty which degrades nor of the
wealth which degenerates. Thanks to
the industry of our people and to the
relatively equal opportunities of our
land, our typical families tend at the
moment to be moderately prosperous.
God has lifted us out of the poverty
which hampered our Catholic fore-
fathers when first they came to Amer-
ica, but, by a mercy almost as great,
He has given us very few Catholic
millionaire families to become effete
“... you are numbered among
the children of God ...”
and undisciplined, a burden to them-
selves and a bore to the community.
You are privileged by the fact of
baptism and by the blessing of the
Faith. Catholicism is a privilege, a
grace which is strictly a gift of God.
You are privileged in your breeding, in
the schools and other educative in-
fluences which have brought you from
childhood and adolescence to mature
manhood. Your Baccalaureate is a
symbol of your most recent privilege,
the privilege by which you, as dis-
tinguished from millions all over the
world and no less worthy, have been
able to devote privileged years at Notre
Dame to special preparation for privi-
leged places in modem society.
I pray God that you will go forth
from this great University to even
greater privileges, but before you do,
I remind you that privileges create in-
equalities and that inequalities based
on privilege carry with them serious
responsibilities.
It is almost political heresy to talk
now-a-days about the providential
character of privilege and the real in-
equalities among men. The under-
standable attempts to defend and de-
velop Democracy, the need to inspire
the American people with a determina-
tion to preserve their Democracy, and
the various measures taken to imple-
ment that determination have all had
one potentially unfortunate effect. Let
no one misunderstand what we are
about to say. No group is more de-
voted to Democracy and all that it
means, none is more indebted to Amer-
ican Democracy than the Catholic
people. Conversely, no people have
more ardently espoused its cause or
contributed to its development than
the Catholic people.
But nevertheless a very real danger
lurks in the loose talk and loose think-
ing of the moment about the equality
that is supposed to be characteristic
of Democracy and of democratic in-
stitutions. In emphasizing civil equal-
ity, legal equality, and the fact that
all men are equally the creatures of
God and entitled to equal justice under
the Law, we stand in danger of for-
getting the many and important ways
in which people are not equal, in which
they need not be equal and in which
they never will be equal, no matter
how many resolutions are passed or
how much eloquence is expended on
the contrary notion.
Genuine Democracy, in any valid
Christian sense or truly American tra-
dition, does not cultivate the pretense
that all men are equal in every respect.
Democracy calls upon us to promote
equal opportunity, equal justice, and a
recognition of those essential equali-
ties which flow from essential human
personality. But far from being bad
Democracy, it is a very real service
to Democracy to resist the mediocrity
and degeneration of values which flow
from the mistaken notion that all men
are equal in every respect, that no
persons are better than others. The
fact is that some persons are very much
better than others; the further fact,
sometimes most important to re-
member, is that some people are very
much worse than others. Democracy
is well served when these facts are

“Stampede! Grab the transit!3'
A student in white bucks and levis
put the instrument on his shoulder and
jumped from the path of forty be-
fuddled steers.
Steer and cow trouble is one of the
things that makes life interesting for
Notre Dame sophomores taking the
Civil Engineering Department’s sum-
mer surveying course. For four weeks
—forty hours a week—these students
concentrate on the kind of work
they’ll be doing as professional sur-
veyors.
In the field they get familiar with
the use of the tape, level, transit and
plane table as they make topographic,
property and highway surveys. Later
they spend long hours over the draft-
ing boards putting their findings on
paper.
The steer and cow trouble comes in
the one week of the program when
Professor Frank Horan takes his
future surveyors daily to 24 acres of
hilly rolling farm land off U. S. 20
near the St. Joseph County Airport.
The site is the adjacent pasture lands
of Clarence Matthews and Frank
Matthews, who have been gracious
hosts to Mr. Horan and his surveying
parties for some ten years.
First of all, at Matthews, data for a
topographic map is gathered. To do
this the surveyors, generally four men
to a group, establish a horizontal con-
trol polygon. They observe the azi-
muths of the lines between transit
stations and tape their lengths. Differ-
ential levels are run over the transit
stations to establish vertical control.
Then detail information is secured by
observing from each transit station the
adjacent points in the field where there
is a pronounced change in slope, along
valley and ridge lines. The resulting
topographic map with contour lines at
two foot intervals is the sort of map
engineers use for highway and railroad
location, reservoir location, drainage
and irrigation problems, and building
site and landscape developments.
A complete survey is made for a
straight highway, one thousand feet
long, across the Matthews pastures.
Cross-sections are taken and grade lines
are established down one hill and up
the other with a vertical curve in-
serted between the grade lines. Slope
stakes are set for the convenience of
the hypothetical contractor. From the
cross-sections the amounts of cut and
fill are figured and the estimate of
quantities for the proposed highway is
completed.
At noon time the students gather

in the shade of a big tree to partake
of their sandwiches and milk and
sometimes the animals get interested
in this procedure.
The final step at Matthews is the
clean up. All stakes are removed and
the way is made clear for the groups
that will follow.
Back on the campus after a week at
the farm, the students continue with
the field problems. At Notre Dame
on the first clear evening available,
they assemble west of the stadium
adjacent to the old Juniper Road and
make observations on Polaris from
which they can determine true north.
Differential levels are run from the
government benchmark at the Engi-
neering Building to establish other
Field problems are conducted on parking lots adjacent to stadium.

Arts & Letters and is from Louisville, Ky.

benchmarks on the Notre Dame
property. Topographic surveys of
portions of the campus are run with the
transit and with the planetable.
The spacious parking fields east of
the stadium afford room for two
problems on horizontal curves for high-
ways and railroads. In one problem
a compound curve is computed and
staked out between two intersecting
lines. In the other problem a spiraled
circular curve is used. Imaginary
obstacles are circumvented in each
problem.
When the field work has been com-
pleted, Professor Horan takes his men
to their drafting rooms in the Engi-
neering Building for nearlv sixtv hours
of map-making.
An additional problem is the design
of a proposed highway from field
notes that have been taken by others.
This is the extension of the Dore
Road from U. S. 31, west to West
Riverside Drive and involves the
elimination of two railroad grade
crossings and the crossing of the St.
Joseph River.
The atmosphere of practicality spills
over into campus activity. The sum-
mer surveyors enjoy a life different
from the life of any other students at
Notre Dame. They live in a hall by
themselves. So they’re not only work-
ing with future civil engineers all day
but they’re with them again back in
their rooms. This way they have a
chance to get to understand pretty
thoroughly the sort of people they’ll
be dealing with the rest of their lives.
For a portion of the summer there
aren’t any students on campus except
those taking the surveying course.
Since there aren’t any other classes to
claim some of the students’ time—life
has a real flavor of actually practicing
as an engineer.
In this four weeks period the stu-
dents at Notre Dame cover surveying
from field work to map-making—both
necessary' stones in a civil engineering
foundation. Bv this sort of intensive
training, the program develops stu-
dents beyond the point possible in
classroom instruction and turns out
men with a taste of professional engi-
neering experience.

In preparation for pursuing a pro-
fessorial career, Father Lauck also
spent a year in European travel and
study, chiefly Romanesque and early
Christian art in France, and Renais-
sance in Italy. All of this was in
addition to the long years of study for
the priesthood climaxed by his ordi-
nation in the Congregation of Holy
Cross in 1946.
When the Pennsylvania Academy
held its 148th annual art exhibition in
Philadelphia, Time magazine reported:
“. . . the top sculpture winner was a
surprise; a Roman Catholic priest who
teaches at Notre Dame—Father An-
thony J. Lauck.” Although it might
have been a “surprise” to many East-
ern connoisseurs, little else would have
been expected with those more fami-
liar with Father’s background and
ability. In the past twenty years he
has received not only a professional
grade diploma from the Herron Art
Institute, an A.B. degree from Notre
Dame but also has done graduate work
at the Corcoran School of Art, the Art
Student’s League and Columbia Uni-
versity.
Father Lauck joined the Notre
Dame faculty in 1950 and has won
many sculpturing awards before and
since his assignment to the University
staff. He was the only artist who re-
ceived two prizes in the 1947 ex-
hibition of the Corcoran Gallery of
Art in Washington, D. C. Several
years later at the Fairmount Park Art
Association, Philadelphia Museum of
Art, in the Third Sculptors Inter-
national Exhibit, his six-foot walnut
carving of “St. John Beside the Cross”
received one of the four purchase
prizes given to Americans.
One of the most coveted distinctions
for a sculptor in the United States is
the George D. Widener Memorial Gold
Medal given by the Pennsylvania
Academy of Fine Arts to the Ameri-
can sculptor who has done the most
outstanding work of art for the year.
Father Lauck was chosen as the Wid-
ener prize winner in 1953 with his
“Monk at Prayer” a gray limestone
figure eighteen inches high on a dark
wood base. He received two awards
at the Indiana State Fair Centennial
Exhibition of Fine Arts, 1952, and last
year was given the Leonard Cantor
Memorial Prize for Sculpture at the
47th annual Indiana Artists Exhibition.
Father Lauck has a fondness for
working in stone and wood rather
than terra cotta but finds the last
named an interesting medium with
which to experiment, and also a great
time-saver in his busy life. As for
subject matter, he does not confine
himself to religious themes although
he finds them of paramount import-

known. And he wishes U. S. artists
would discard their inferiority com-
plex. “If an artist is from Europe,”
he says, “we in America immediately
think he is superior. I have visited
cian, cheeks puffed to bursting, with a
lowly harmonica to his lips—called by
the sculptor “Turkey in the Straw.”
Although Father Lauck today ex-
hibits his peaceful religious statues
from time to time, he mostly contents
himself with teaching Notre Dame stu-
dents. Those who take his course are
not just majoring in art or architecture.
You find among the group students in
chemistry, engineering, economics and
journalism. The idea of “sculpture
for fun” springs from Father Lauck’s
belief that some form of creative work,
such as sculpture, should be made
available to every student at the uni-
versity. “There is nothing so restric-
tive, phony, or curious about art that
it can’t be enjoyed by every boy here,”
he says. Although Father Lauck im-
presses upon each student the necessity
for individuality in his work, he never-
theless realizes the value of studying
the style of established artists. Students
learn to model in water clay and carve
in maple. He has also taught students
the technique of creating the illusion
of movement and rhythm through the
use of wire sculpture.
One of Father Lauck’s personal con-
victions is: the best modem art is just

his talent as a sculptor and artist,
Father Lauck has been in demand as
a speaker as well as a contributor to

Several years ago he became the

and enthusiasm in the classroom mark
him as one of the University’s out-
standing teachers—as well as one of

1,000 Volunteers
In Notre Dame’s Usher Corps

j\
c
One thousand volunteer ushers, who
are employed in various capacities
during the normal five-day work week
in South Bend, form a highly effective
organization for directing 57,000 foot-
ball fans to their proper seat location
in the Notre Dame Stadium through-
out the “home season” each autumn.
Their responsibility entails an efficient
public-relations job and they do it in
a most laudatory manner.
The usher corps, under the jurisdic-
tion of the office of Mr. Herb Jones,
business manager of athletics, draws its
membership from downtown industrial
organizations, including Studebaker
and Bendix corporations. These men
voluntarily offer their time and effort
to be able to witness the Notre Dame
football games after all of the fans
have been seated.
The position of molding a group of
men into a smooth-running unit be-
o
longs to Mr. Devere M. Plunkett, who
holds down the job of director of sta-
dium personnel. Mr. Leonard Glau-
don, an employee of the Studebaker
corporation, is the assistant director.
Operating from an office under the
north end zone stands, Plunkett directs
the work of the ushers with the aid of
60 messengers and an inter-stadium
telephone.
The stadium’s 36 sections are man-
ned by 1000 ushers and 13 “gold-
topped” supervisors coordinate the
duties of the ushers in and outside of
the stadium. It is their responsibility
for possible gate crashers. Each section
has a senior captain and a junior
captain. It is the captain’s duty to
supervise the work of the gatemen, the
ticket-takers, and the rampmen. The
senior and junior captains wear the
same “blue-topped” hat that the other
ushers wear, but they are distinguished
from them by an arm band.
Mr. Plunkett remarked that “no
two games are ever the same for the
usher; something always comes up.”
Enthusiastic Texans at a recent game
insisted on making provisions for their
mascot in the stadium. Normally this
wouldn’t involve too much confusion,
but they brought a real Texas steer all
the way from Dallas without notifying
the University beforehand. After a
bit of wrangling over the incident it
was decided to give in to the fun-
lovin’ Texans and the ushers erected
a “corral” in front of the box seats on
the east side of the stadium. The
steer amused the people for awhile, but

as the afternoon
became warmer the

proximity of the animal to the fans
was quite noticeable.
Oklahoma fans, equally devoted to
tradition, planned to have a group of
partisans lock arms on either side of
the team entrance to form an aisle for
the Sooners to pass through as they
came onto the gridiron. This time Mr.
Jones was adamant in his decision not
to allow the idea to be carried out be-
cause no arrangements were made
beforehand and Notre Dame policy
discourages fans from participating on
the field. Sooner plans were not dis-
rupted for at the appointed time their
rooters poured onto the field to wel-
come the team. It’s such enthusiasm
that adds to the usher’s weekly woes.
The ushers were put to a real test
last Fall when the Purdue band
brought its huge drum into the sta-
dium. The late Fred Snite, Jr., a

was not scheduled to see the Purdue
game and the University authorized
the Boilermakers to park their carriage-
drawn drum in the north end zone
entrance which on other occasions was
occupied by the Snite bus. Snite came
to the game, however, and the drum
was then moved over in front of the
flagpole. The game was already under-
way and a cluster of fans, now hidden
by the big drum, became excited about
the matter. In an attempt to calm
the fans, the ushers worked hastily to
lower the drum to the ground. A
Purdue bandsman hurried frantically
across the field, fearing that the damp
ground would harm the drum. The
ushers, caught between two deter-
mined forces, somehow managed to
lower the drum out of the fans’ line
of vision and yet kept it from being
damaged.
The late student rush for seats led
to the development of the “electric
eye” ticket-puncher now used at gate
16. The ushers were forced to hand-
punch student identification cards and
the late dash caused a bit of con-
fusion. Thanks to the ingenuity of
Mr. Frank Redfern, a Notre Dame
supervisor, the electric apparatus has
facilitated this problem immensely.

Stadium gates are locked on morning of
game at 11 a.m. Looking for “crashers”
are Supervisors (L to R) Mackin, Dillon,
Raabe, Hertel, Lavallee and Scherger.

At approximately 11 a.m. on game
Saturdays the stadium is locked. Thir-
teen supervisors give the stadium a
methodical “combing” to search out
the “free-loaders.” It is literally
checked from top to bottom.
Crashers have attempted lying on
the roof of the press box in hopes of
escaping detection, and still others have
taken to the stadium sewers, only to
be “fished” out by ever-alert ushers.
Some have tried hiding in the tarpaulin
cover, used to protect the field against
the rain, but even this is not over-
looked by the inspectors. Some “ama-


teurs” huddled in the washrooms, but
the ushers are constantly alert and all
conceivable spots a gate crasher might
hide are checked.
Ordinarily you wouldn’t have to
“join” the Navy to crash a stadium
but it happened back in 1943. Five
companies of Naval cadets were lined
up from the north end of the playing
field to Cartier field ready to march
into the stadium for a pre-game cere-
mony honoring World War II dead.
As the company officer yelled “march,”
a shabbily dressed character bedecked
in out-dated political buttons ‘fell in’
between the second and third company
of Middies. Mr. William Duley, then
director of stadium personnel, stopped
him with a familiar “hey, where do
you think you’re going?” Surprised
but undaunted he said, “inside.” When
Duley informed him otherwise the
would-be spectator remarked that he’d
crashed every stadium in the country.
He was politely told that this would
have to be an exception.
Who is responsible for this unique
organization? How did it originate?
Student managers were in charge when
the stadium was first opened to the
public back in 1930. But the school,
realizing the need for a permanent
usher organization, asked William H.
Duley to gather recruits. Four years
later he became director of stadium
personnel, and held this position until
his retirement after the Notre Dame-
Southem California game in 1949.
In the many years that Duley head-
ed the usher organization it developed
a wide variety of talents. In 1948 the
ushers were assigned the task of mov-
ing 3000 people in and out of

(continued from page 7)
scrupulously pointed out and the
reasons are honestly stated why some
men are better and what makes others
worse.
It is a false Democracy, it is an evil
spirit hostile to Democracy, which seeks
to level all persons and reduce to least
common denominators all beliefs, all
differences, and all values. This spuri-
ous spirit of Democracy, this counter-
feit Democracy pretends that all privi-
lege is unfounded and all inequality
is unfortunate. It promotes the in-
sincere pretense that all religions are
equally of divine right and that all
shades of human thinking are equally
accurate; it is even argued that those
who refuse to discredit legitimate
privilege or to abdicate divine pre-
rogatives offend the principles of
Democracy.
This sort of talk, so common in our
day, is simple nonsense. Not all medi-
cal techniques are equally effective.
Not all preferences in art reflect equal
taste or culture. Not all business pro-
cedures are equally well-advised. Not
all poetry is equally inspired. Not all
forms of Government promote public
welfare equally. Not all religious sys-
tems echo with equal fidelity the voice
of God’s Revelation through Jesus
Christ. Not all religious are equally
true and not all systems of thought,
religious, political, or other, have equal
rights before the face of truth.
This is unpopular preaching, but it
cannot be too often repeated in these
days so hostile to legitimate privileges
and to inevitable and important in-
equalities. Not all persons are equally
capable. Not all are equally coura-
geous. Not all are equally competent.
Not all are equally kind, or equally
honest, or equally trustworthy, or
equally just, or equally God-fearing,
or equally loyal.
A Democracy is in danger when
essential equalities are neglected or
denied. But a Democracy is no less
endangered when important differences
of a natural or supernatural kind are
forgotten or despised. Never forget
the important ways in which all per-
sons are equal with you, but be no less
mindful of the many ways in which
you must resist mere equality with
others. Be conscious and proud of
your legitimate differences. Recognize
and implement your obligations to be
14
better than people about you. It is no
sin against political democracy to
aspire after spiritual and intellectual
aristocracy. On the contrary, the
foundations of decent democracy must
always be nourished by an aristocracy
of the soul, the only aristocracy that
the Gospels preach, and one that Jesus
Christ made mandatory to those who
profess to follow Him.
Democracy will decay and ignomini-
ously die if you accept the lie that all
privilege is illicit and that absolute
equality is ideal or even possible. You
cannot rest content in equality with
the crow’d in grace, in attainment of
truth, in mastery of virtue, in growth
unto the image of God. There must
always be people better than the rest
in these essential respects—more holy,
more pure, more competent, more
hopeful, more kind, more disposed to
service, and espoused to duty than the
general run of mankind. Unless such
an aristocracy of the soul exists in
every nation and at all times, then the
essential equalities, in recognition of
which genuine Democracy exists, will
be speedily forgotten, undermined, and
destroyed.
Be Tolerant of All Good Faith
There are, I repeat, many in the
modern world who would have you
believe that as Catholics and as the
beneficiaries of certain real privileges,
you are no different from others and
need be no better. That pretense is
of Satan and it is totally false. I beg
you not to become its victims. Give
every man his due; be genial and
generous to all persons; be tolerant of
all good faith; exert your every energy
in behalf of the human rights of all
individuals and of every group; be
particularly militant in behalf of the
disenfranchised, the underprivileged,
and those who are powerless to protect
themselves. But do not accept re-
duction to the dead level of dignity
and worth which is sought by those
who resent your legitimate privileges
and despise your divinely-intended
differences.
So live that your proud differences
may be apparent to all and respected
by all. “Behold how you are num-
bered among the children of God, and
your lot is among the saints.” It was
not that you might be the mediocre,
moral equals of the spiritually under-
privileged who have faint faith, scant
hope, and frigid charity, that so much
was devised by heaven and sacrificed
on earth in your behalf. You are heirs
of twenty Catholic centuries of apostles
and martyrs, confessors and saints. You
are the sons of prayers and spiritual
yearnings, of divine hopes as well as of
human blood, sweat, and tears. Our
children are not bom of the will of
the flesh alone, nor only of the will of
men; they are bom of God. Christ
did not become incarnate, His Apostles
did not preach and His saints suffer,
His people did not withstand the slings
and arrows of outrageous fortune
through all the history of the Caesars
and the Vandals, the Huns and the
feudal princes, the national kings and
the modem dictators, in order that,
after all these aspirations, you might
add the final outrage of annulling their
sacrifices by accepting mere equality
of dogmatic faith and moral worth
with their detractors and their perse-
cutors.
Spiritual Aristocracy
So, while reminding you of your
obligations to Democracy, I make an
appeal this morning for the develop-
ment among you of a spiritual aris-
tocracy, an elite of mind and heart and
soul. You will do this best by frequent-
ly meditating on your privileges and by
recognizing effectively the responsibili-
ties which arise from them. Even as
the correlative of right is duty, so that
of privilege is responsibility. Duties
correspond to the rights of others;
responsibilities are attached to some-
thing in ourselves, our offices, our own
dignities, our talents, our positions, our
privileges. Your privileges obligate
you to the sources whence they came,
to the families that gave you birth and
good names; to the civil society that
gave you temporal advantages; to the
Church that gave you baptism, your re-
birth to life everlasting; to the Univer-
sity which in so many ways acts for all
these as the guardian of your privileges
and the guide to the responsibilities
correlative to them.
God grant that you will serve all
these well, that you will be worthy of
your names, loyal to your State, faith-
ful sons of your Church, Catholic
Americans of whom Notre Dame may
be proud, privileged men who deserve
their privileges by meeting their re-
sponsibilities, who serve others by being
better than others, leaders of men,
children of God! “Behold how you
are numbered among the children of
God, and your lot is among the
saints.”

AMERICAN TWELFTH NIGHT
— Other Poems: Sr. M. Madeleva,
C.S.C. $2. The MacMillan Co.,
New York 11, N. Y.
Praising the poetry of Sr. M. Made-
leva, C.S.C., M.A. T8, LL.D. ’53,
distinguished president of St. Mary’s
College, is a little on the order of
endorsing the Ten Commandments. It
is, personally, a pleasure in either case.
Sister Madeleva’s new book, is a
natural for the early Christmas shop-
pers who wish to give something really
lasting and distinctive. With an aura
of the adjoining campuses—it con-
tains some of her most characteristic
approach to Christmas, in a lovely
distillation of the tongues of men until
it reads like the tongues of angels,
with the added essential embodiment
of a deep charity.
One of the purposes of poetry, or
at least its fruits, is the expression of
extraordinary thought with great
beauty. Sister Madeleva has a delicate
intellectual strength that achieves this,
outstandingly. And yet, for us hard
pressed to reach these heights, she also
achieves another purpose of poetry, to
catch ordinary thought and to dress
it for us in different beauty.
Few gifts at Christmas will put
Christ into it as effectively. (J.E.A.)
ND ’55 Grad Named Top
Advertising Student in U. S.
A 22-year-old June graduate of
Notre Dame, headed for a two year
hitch in the Navy, has been named
the Outstanding Advertising Student
in America, 1955, by the Association
of Advertising Men and Women, New
York.
John William Sorrano of Fresno,
California was chosen Outstanding Ad
Student as a result of his participation
in the AAM & W’s 5th annual Inside
Advertising Week held last April. He
was one of 50 top advertising and
marketing seniors representing their
respective schools at a week-long trip
“inside advertising.” The students
were instructed and entertained in New
York by major advertiser, agency,
media and service organizations in a
series of lectures, tours, conferences,
lunches and dinners.
Sorrano received the award based
on his participation during the Week,
school scholastic and extra-curricular
record, and the voluminous report on
Inside Advertising Week he submitted
to the AAM & W. This report in-
cluded an opinion survey of last year’s
Inside Advertising students, and a de-
tailed report of the 16 sessions he
attended last April.
A marketing major, Sorrano came
to Notre Dame on a track scholarship
and was on the Varsity track team
four years. Although interested in art
layout and production, he said, “this
trip made me realize how important it
is to have a ‘broad’ education.”

Everyone who knew George Roche-
leau, ’34, when he was in college as a
Notre Dame undergraduate, felt he
O	5
would become an artist of some kind,
but, because he did much writing for
Father Leo L. Ward’s Scrip and his
classes in English composition, most
thought he would become a writer.
Instead, he became a painter, and
the fifty-seven oils which he exhibited
this summer in the University Art
Gallery in O’Shaughnessy Hall show
him to be one of the best Notre Dame
can boast.
Mainly landscapes, the Rocheleau
paintings are alive with a sense for the
joy in nature, and its essential holiness.
His painting invites comparison with
another Notre Dame artist, the novelist
Richard Sullivan. Both treat everyday
life, and in that sense are realists; but
both find reality deeply imbued with
the goodness God has planted there.
Their art does indeed “. . . keep warm
men's wits to the things that are,” in
the words of Gerard Hopkins.
Rocheleau sort of backed into being
a painter. Always deeply interested
in modem art especially, he began
painting only after graduation. He
got a job selling prints, which brought
him in contact with other artists. By
day he studied the old masters, willy-
nilly, and by night he painted. When
he began to take night classes at the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago,
he encountered Francis Chapin, one
of America’s foremost painters, at that
time Professor of Painting there and
Director of the Institute’s Summer
School at Saugatuck, Michigan. Ex-
cited by Chapin’s ideas about color,
Rocheleau infested both places, and
soon became a full-time painter.
His painting owes much to Chapin,
and much as well to the modem
French painters he admires—Renoir,
Dufy and Bonnard especially. But it
is very much his own. Like Dufy, he
is witty; like Bonnard, he rejoices in
color; but his wit and his color are his
own brand. He paints simply and
naturally, without stiff copying or
labored abstraction. Copeland Burg,
himself a painter of note, and art
critic for the Chicago Her aid-Ameri-
can, said of him: “Rocheleau paints
the way every man of taste and feeling
would like to paint, if only he could.”
Many of the paintings in the show
were done in the south of France,
where the Rocheleaus lived for two
years from 1949 to 1951. Others were

done in Chicago
most recent of 1
Street El Station,
and Saugatuck. The
them, the “Howard
,” is a good illustra-
tion of the Rocheleau habit of clothing
an everyday scene in eye-filling
splendor.
“Painting is for the eye,” he says;
but like most painters he dislikes to
talk about his work, or, indeed, to say
any final things about anybody’s work.
“The thing to do with painting is to
look at it,” he says. “You can say
exactly the same things about bad
painting as about good painting.”
No facile worker, Rocheleau comes
back again and again to a canvas, and
parts with one reluctantly when a
buyer flashes the $150 a good sized
oil costs. He works these days in a
penthouse studio atop an apartment
building at 1205 W. Sherwin Ave., in
Chicago, where he lives with his wife
and daughter. The building is on
o	o
Lake Michigan, which he loves to
bays, inlets
paint, though he prefers
and boats to broad stretches of water.
Few painters live by sales alone, and
Rocheleau teaches several painting

classes in the Chicago area. This
leaves him less time for painting than
he likes, but nonetheless he has shown
pictures this year in the annual Chi-
cago artists exhibition at the Art In-
stitute, and in the invitation show of
the American Association of Art. Sev-
eral Chicago galleries show his work.

Co-Eds
Nuns Attend Summer Classes

'"'What! Women at Notre Darnel”
An uninformed outsider would swear
it “can’t be true”—everyone knows
that Notre Dame is “for men only.”
But it was different this summer—the
same as it has been for the past 30
years. There WERE women at Notre
Dame! And the 806 nuns attending
classes in the graduate and under-
graduate departments equalled more
than half of the summer school enroll-
ment. The remaining groups con-
sisted of 557 laymen. 153 Priests. 108
Brothers and 82 Seminarians.
It is highly unlikely that any of the
nuns who came to Notre Dame will
ever be a Wall Street executive oi'

project. But ostensibly the magnetic
attraction that brings them to this
campus annually is the availability of
293 classroom courses ranging from
financial management of a banking in-
stitution to the calculation of statistical
thermo-dynamics. Having already at-
tained a perspective on subjects most
appealing to adolescents, the teaching
nuns may be found studying many un-
usual courses offered during the sum-
mer curriculum. “My students have a

alert to answer the dozens of questions
that pop up,” remarked a Sister who
spends her time during the remaining
nine months tutoring youngsters of

do a better job.”
.An unusual “case history” is that of
Sister Mary’ Euphrosine Bielogurz.
O.S.F., a parochial science teacher in
Philadelphia. Pa., who has been taking
a course in the electrical engineering
department. She studied the technical
aspects of electrical circuits, AG and
DC motors, cathode tubes, voltmeters
and ammeters. Another is Sister Mary
Daniel Tammany, St. Louis, Mo.,
educational program director for her
archdiocese, who was enrolled in the
speech department’s “Workshop in
“Telecommunication Arts.” Sistei
Mary is a committee member of the
advisory’ board of Station KETG-TV
in St. Louis and has participated in va-
rious television productions directed
toward the educational needs of learn-
ing ranging from grade school to
college.
Notre Dame’s science program has
been an outstanding attraction for
nuns during the summer session. At
almost any hour of the day you might
find some of them in Nieuwland
Science Hall patiently puttering around
technicolor liquids, aromatic gases and
other scientific paraphernalia in the
fields of mathematics, physics and
chemistry.

Liturgical chants and theatrical pro-
ductions are about as far apart as any
two subjects might be but the study
of both was in much demand by the
good Sisters. One of the more un-
usual aspects of the liturgical progam
was the “workshop in Gregorian In-
tegration5' in which a group of children
demonstrated the inspirational beauty
of liturgy by performing rhythmic
movements to ancient chant.
“Domitille,'5 a three-act play written
by a cloistered nun, was presented at
Notre Dame especially for production
during the summer session. Fourteen
Sisters from eleven religious orders
were cast in the play. It is the first
original play written by a nun and
presented at the University.
Some of the nuns offset a grueling

academic schedule with a bit of relaxa-
tion in the Rockne Memorial swim-
ming pool. Miss Mary Brady. Rock-
ford. Ill., their recreational leader this
summer, stated: “Many of the Sisters
display proficient diving and swimming
abilities. Several of them are former
senior life guards, some have done
ballet swimming and a few actually
were competitors in professional swim-
ming meets.”
The College of Commerce has a
program designed to provide advance
professional training for nuns who are
in the capacity of treasurers, financial
secretaries or accountants in their par-
ticular religious order. Courses in
economics, business statistics, business
law, taxation policies and corporation
finance are offered to the nun who is
advisor on financial matters for her
convent. This program takes five
summers to complete and leads to the
degree of master of business adminis-
tration.
Sister Mary Vincent Meyer. R.S.M.,
Grand Rapids. Mich., has just finished
her fifth year of summer school study
at Notre Dame and is striving to
attain her master’s degree in music.
She is a remarkable and talented com-
poser. and more recently began teach-
ing music to grade school children via
“The Technicolor System.” Each line
of the scale is of a different color and
she finds that children are more recep-
tive to this unique method of learning
music.
One of the nuns this past summer
did exceptionally fine work in sculp-
turing. Sister Mary Monica Gabriel.
O.P.. Racine. Wis.. is not only a
sculptor but also a painter. Visitors
to the St. Mary’s College campus in
Notre Dame. Ind., have an opportunity
to view her “Christ the Teacher” statue
which has been erected in front of the
university library. This year she did
fresco painting and studied under the
Rev. Anthony J. Lauck, C.S.C.. Notre
Dame’s priest-sculptor. In addition
to Sister Mary Monica, three other
nuns are engaged in work with cera-
mic clay and one is carving a figure of
St. Joseph in wood for her convent
in Chicago.
A “non-academic highlight’’ came
after the final examination when a big
picnic dinner with all the trimmings
was held in the University Drill Hall.
Following the picnic. Cartier Field,
immortal stamping ground of Irish
football greats, was transformed into
a baseball diamond and. one of the
spectators remarked. “They play as
snappy a softball game as anv pro
team.”
The nuns at Notre Dame during the
summer school session are as much a
part of the University as those husky
lads who trod the campus from Sep-
tember to Tune. And although an out-
sider mi Jit raise his eyebrows and ex-
claim. “What! Women at Notre
Dame!” alumni and undergraduates
know, the very name of Our Lady’s
University honors a “special woman.”
Because twelve months of every year
since the day the cornerstone was laid
for the first building, the Holy Cross
Priests, faculty and students have de-
voted themselves and their work to
Her the Blessed Mother.
