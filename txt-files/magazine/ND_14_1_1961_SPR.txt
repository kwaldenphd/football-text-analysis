THE BASIC PURPOSE
OF EDUCATION
in the United States is to provide the opportunity for
each individual to acquire the knowledge and under-
standing necessary to recognize and to discharge the
personal and social responsibilities of life to the full extent
of his ability. The function of higher education is to
pursue this purpose on more sophisticated levels which
necessarily include the advancement as well as the dis-
semination of knowledge. In a rapidly changing world
our colleges and universities serve as custodians of the
intellectual capital of mankind; they also serve as centers
of innovation and change, of investigation of the applica-
tion of knowledge to current needs, and of re-examination
and criticism of society.
At no previous time in history has higher education
faced such urgent demands. Scientific advances and the
explosion of knowledge foretell revolutionary changes to
come in the immediate future. The increasing complexity
of today’s social, political, scientific, and economic struc-
ture requires of an educated person such information
and understanding as could not have been imagined a
generation ago. Within a century, colleges and uni-
versities have moved from the limited goal of preparing
a few people for a few professions to the full responsi-
bility for the preparation of trained manpower needed
in hundreds of occupations, ranging from the technical
and semiprofessional worker with two years of college
to the professional worker with many years of graduate
and postdoctoral education. Equally significant is the
demand for research and development programs to pro-
mote understanding and to advance knowledge and
hasten its application in many areas in this period of
exploding populations and growing international tension.
The scope of higher education today, of necessity, extends
far beyond the college years to include continuing edu-
cation of many kinds, international educational exchange,
and assistance in a multitude of ways to government,
business and industry, agriculture, the military services,
and other segments of society.
Thus, a proper investment in higher education in-
volves investment adequate to an enterprise which in-
creasingly undergirds both the dynamic national economy
and free society as a whole.
HIGHER
EDUCATION
appropriate to the times can never be cheap, and will
indeed become more expensive. More and better higher
education requires a major advance from present levels
of financial support similar to those already evident in
such areas as military defense and highway development.
The tiny fraction of our national income invested in
higher education — hardly more than one per cent —
has not only provided plants and facilities; it has also
vastly increased the productivity of our trained man-
power, has transformed our economy, and has con-
tributed to our national and international strensrth. Yet
these achievements still fall short of meeting' current

A Report to Decision-Makers
The price of excellence in every aspect of higher
education is high and inevitably rising. But it is, and
will be, less than the cost to the American people of
settling for the wasteful ineffectiveness of educational
mediocrity. The following is a statement of the Problems
and Policies Committee of the American Council on
Education of which Father Hesburgh is a member. The
Council, comprising 141 educational organizations and
more than one thousand educational institutions, is a
center of cooperation and coordination for the improve-
ment of education at all levels, with particular em-
phasis upon higher education.
needs. At a time when knowledge has multiplied many
fold, the birth rate doubled., and the domestic and world
situation become even more complex and precarious, we
urgently need to establish a higher priority rating for
expenditures to improve and enlarge the range of higher
education.
These increased demands cannot be met painlessly,
but public thinking will adjust itself more readily when
the price of educational adequacy is looked upon, not
as a cost, but as an investment that promises rich returns
and is indeed indispensable to a free and explosively
developing society.
SINCE OTHER
SOCIAL NEEDS
must also be met, there are, of course, limits to the re-
sources available for the support and development of
higher education. This report does not advocate extrava-
gant or thoughtless expenditures. Our institutions of
higher education and their sponsoring agencies must
examine, honestly and carefully, ways in which they are
currently utilizing personnel, facilities, and space.
Many institutions, as well as some states and regions,
have already taken steps to clarify their goals and to re-
examine their programs and procedures in the light of
these goals. In some areas, institutions have voluntarily
agreed to delimit their activities to avoid duplications
and to concentrate on the work for which each is most
suited. Important economies have been effected, but
more are called for. There is a continuing obligation to
get maximum value for each dollar spent.
A GREAT WASTE IN
HIGHER EDUCATION
prime source of waste is the initiation of new programs
or the continuation of ineffective ones, particularly of a
professional and graduate character, while already suc-
cessful and useful programs are not being employed to
their maximum.
Institutional imperialism and special-interest pressure
are among the forces which contribute to such duplica-
tions of effort. Wasteful programs now existing can be
reduced only with great difficulty, and in actuality some
that represent duplications may eventually be justified
by new demands. But additional ones which are educa-
tionally unnecessary and economically unsound should
be resisted by all leaders of opinion.
State-wide planning for the efficient allocation of
educational responsibilities needs to become far more
general. Similarly, regional planning is capable of much
wider and more intensive development.
WASTED
OPPORTUNITY
is another great loss in higher education. Sometimes this
results from poor teaching; sometimes, from inadequate
student response. Both the incompetent, indifferent, or
inept teacher and the poorly motivated or misplaced
student have much to answer for here.
An increase in the supply of fully qualified college
teachers is a task of central importance. To accomplish
this involves improving the status of the profession, pro-
viding adequate compensation, inducing a larger pro-
portion of the best college seniors to enter graduate
school, and offering easily accessible and thoroughly ef-
fective programs of graduate instruction. To this end
money must be spent to save money.
Despite the urgency of avoiding wasteful replications
of curricular offerings, the aspirations of an increasing
percentage of the college-age group for further educa-
tion and society’s urgent need for an ever-enlarging
pool of properly educated persons place upon our higher
educational institutions the obligation to provide a suf-
ficiently wide array of programs to meet varied student
needs, interests, and abilities. To match the student’s
wants and capabilities with the offerings of the college
is the joint responsibility of the student, his parents, the
secondary school guidance staff, and the college admis-
sions officer.
The waste of time and talent of student and teacher
when unwise choices or poor admissions policies and

among and within institutions. Educational costs increase

procedures result in failure is a continuing challenge to
educational statesmanship. Admission to college can
never guarantee successful student performance and
eventual graduation, but a qualified student has a right
to expect an opportunity to demonstrate his competence
and drive in an appropriate educational environment.
Similar problems of student selection and successful per-
formance exist at all levels in higher education.
o
ALTHOUGH IT CAN
BE ARGUED
that quality in higher education is worth whatever it
may cost, colleges and universities are under no less
obligation than other forms of enterprise to operate as
efficiently as possible. But educational institutions do not
produce standardized products, and it is a mistake to
impose common denominators of accounting upon them.
The unit costs of undergraduate education vary and,
in any case, are very different from those for graduate
or professional education. Similarly, an adequate stu-
dent-teacher ratio for a law school is an inappropriate
measure for a medical school. The custodial care of
buildings may be determined by formulas quite like
those of business or industry, but expenditures for li-
braries and laboratories do not lend themselves to such
procedures. In short, granting the urgency of maximum
utilization of educational resources, this consideration
should not result in false or misplaced economies which
stand in the way of improving education.
THE QUALITY
OF EDUCATION
is reflected in an amalgam of many elements beginning
with such fundamentals as the teacher, the student, and
the curriculum. Part of education’s task is to provide an
environment in which young people may become more
sensitive to truth and beauty. The esthetic appreciations
to be drawn from great literature, from conversation and
lectures, from experiencing various art forms, and from
living among well-designed buildings are important to the
whole pattern of education. The stimuli provided by the
proximity of great minds and by residential and other
arrangements that bring students and faculty together in
creatively exciting ways are similarly important. The in-
struments of knowledge must have a timelessness and a
timeliness in combination, giving students perspective in
their views of themselves and of the world. When the
total attributes of education are identified or translated
in such terms, there can be reasonable assumptions of
quality and effectiveness.
This is not to be construed as a license to luxury.
Learning is, after all, a rigorous — often lonely — disci-
pline and certainly it is no stranger to the Spartan sim-
plicities. Society, however, must challenge those who
refuse, in the name of economy, to face the implications
of such facts as the urgent need for first-rate teacher-
scholars and the present scarcity of good libraries and
laboratories required to further the expansion of knowl-
edge. To confuse such necessities with luxuries is as
shallow and misleading as to talk about mass education
as if it had any meaning apart from the education of
large numbers of individuals.
The most important thing that can happen in any
institution of higher learning is learning: learning to
think, to relate, to do. This process, seldom easy, involves
the teacher-scholar as well as the student. It derives
from many factors: native curiosity and the concern to
know and understand, stimulating teaching, adequate
preparation of the student for the work he confronts,
effective tools with which to work, and an ethos con-
ducive to intellectual effort. Essentially, at whatever
level, it is the interaction of mind on mind.
This interaction may occur in the lecture hall or the
tutorial meeting; it may be the product of reading or
of a laboratory assignment, or of a televised presentation.
No one method can assure learning, but experience sug-
gests that some methods are likely to be more effective
than others. They may vary with the nature of the educa-
tional enterprise or even with fields of knowledge, but,
once determined, they should be embraced at all costs.
So important is the end in view, both to the individual
and to our free society, that true economy dictates the
choice of the most effective rather than the least expen-
sive means.

We have a focus on the new Me-
morial Library and the other projects
of the $18 million 3-year top priority
program, but even beyond these we are
thinking of all the things that this uni-
versity is going to mean to young men
in the years to come. The exciting
challenge of the Ford Foundation’s
matching gift proposal presents the
Notre Dame family with a tremendous
additional incentive. I like to feel that
there is not a young man in this coun-
try who can’t come here and be in-
spired and feel he is alive in a sense
he’s never been alive before with the
kind of inspiration for his Catholic
life that comes from Cardinal O’Hara.
Here he can get the kind of inspiration
for his personal sense of devotion, for
sharpening his mind, for being all that
he can be in his day and his times.
I think there’s no limit to where we
can go as we look ahead. I would not
be at all surprised if ten years from now
our budget was not $18 million but
$35 million or more. I wouldn’t be at
all surprised if a short span of years
from now we not only have the library
built and functioning and getting filled
with books, but we’d also have graduate
residence facilities, as well as more un-
dergraduate halls to take care of the
few boys that are still off-campus. We
have just had approved over three-
quarters of a million dollars by the
Atomic Energy Commission to make
basic plans for putting up a new radia-
tion laboratory which will be the
greatest in this field at any university
in the country. This comes directly
from the Atomic Energy Commission
because of the work being done here.
I think we’ll have other great lab-
oratories for biology, and I hope we’ll
have equally great laboratories for the
study of man. We want to study what
is happening to man in contemporary
society, what is happening to our
ture, to our moral principles, to
cul-
our
world’s diplomatic and political situa-
tion, to our business world. We intend
to contribute to the study of anything
that is important for man in con-
temporary society, anything that con-
tributes to the dignity of man, and his
fulfillment and capacity to respond to
the great challenges, spiritual, moral,
economic, political, that he is facing to-
day. Here these things will be studied.
Because we are alive and a great uni-
versity we can attract to this place the
greatest men of our time to come and
o
stay and study and to be a part of this
university. And I think our dreams
and our ambitions
all the world.
We could build
can be as wide as
a library that was
much less ambitious, one that would
double our present capacity for books.
Or we could say that we’re going to
keep all the books we have in the pres-
ent library and merely build one as
large again since we used that one for
40 years. But this would be looking
backwards instead of forward. Instead,
we say let’s build a library four or
five times as big as the present struc-
ture. As the library fills with books we’ll
build something else to take care of
other needs. Let’s look ahead and
dream big the way the men who came
here years ago dreamed big.
We’ve got to move and to resolve to
raise $12 million in two years in order
to qualify for the generous matching
gift of $6 million from the Ford Foun-
dation. I think we can do it together
and I’m depending on the 100% en-
thusiastic support of our devoted alum-

SOVIET STRATEGY
and FREE WORLD DEFENSE
by Gerhart Niemeyer
The author is professor of political science at Notre
Dame and has been a member of the faculty since 1955.
Dr. Niemeyer was born in Germany and was educated
there as well as in England. He received a doctor of laws
degree from Kiel University. Dr. Niemeyer left his native
country in 1933 when Hitler came to power. In addition
to Notre Dame he has taught at other leading American
universities including Princeton from 1937 until 1944;
Oglethorpe from 1944 to 1950; as well as at Yale and
at Columbia. He was Planning Advisor in the Depart-
ment of State from 1950 to 1953 and Research Analyst
for the Council on Foreign Relations from 1953 to 1955
just prior to his being appointed to the Notre Dame
faculty. He is the author of KAn Inquiry Into Soviet
Mentality.33
Basic Communist Assumptions
It is often said that the Communist objective is
world conquest. This is true, but in a more fundamental
sense than is usually implied. Communists are not people
who simply decided one day to conquer the world, and
presumably could just as easily drop this objective if it
does not attract them any longer. What is called the
basic Communist objective is part and parcel of the entire
world view in which the Communists see man, society,
and history.
Communists believe that the world, as a result of
inescapable social and historical laws, is embroiled in an
all-pervading and irreconcilable struggle between two
hostile “camps”: one consisting of the forces of the
future age of socialism, the other of the forces of the
present age of capitalism. This struggle, rooted in the
hostility between social classes, will go on for a pro-
tracted period of unknown duration, but will surely end
with the total victory of the forces of the future over
those of the present. Of those forces the Communists
pretend to be the leaders, and the Soviet Union the
foremost instrument of power.
Communists, therefore, assume that in view of this
all-pervading struggle, men are not now united by any-
thing like common truth, common morality, or common
good. Society is essentially a battlefield, the only laws
being those of the class struggle. Thus, for Communists,
struggle is a condition into which they were born and
which they expect to continue for an indefinite time to
come. Only a total victory of the Communist forces—a
victory of which they do not have the slightest doubt—
can put an end to this struggle. As a result of a Com-
munist total victory, mankind supposedly would be re-
deemed from all the ancient curses of human existence,
particularly war, oppressive power, and want. Com-
munists believe that their victory is assured by the laws
of history, and that it is the only hope for mankind.
The so-called objective of world conquest is therefore
not simply a chosen goal of communism, but the logic of
the entire world situation as seen by dialectical material-
ism. Before Communists could abandon that goal, they
would have to give up their world view, a process which
is rarely a success in an individual person and well-nigh
impossible in a society in which that world view is
authoritatively maintained.
Basic Principles of Communist Strategy
Communists, assuming themselves to be engaged in a
life-long struggle with a definite and hopeful end in view,
think above all in terms of strategy. The most funda-
mental assumption of Communist strategy is that the
party is carrying on a power struggle from a position of
weakness. The forces of the present age—that is, the
forces contending for capitalist society—are supposedly
far stronger than those of the future, Socialist, age. This
is true even when and where Communists have seized
the power of government. Communist strategy has from
the beginning focused on the problem of how to destroy
the power of a vastly stronger class enemy.
The main principles of this strategy were first con-
ceived by Lenin, further articulated by Stalin, and later
expressed in the most consistent form by Mao Tse Tung.
Starting from the concept of a small, compact, tightly
disciplined party which always would be in the minority,
it operates along three lines: (a) The power momentum
6 NOTRE DAME

of large masses led and manipulated by the Communist
Party; (b) the dissolution of the bonds of public order
among the Communists’ enemies; and (c) the multiplier
effect of organizational key positions.
Unlike the strategic concepts developed by Blanqui
।	and Tkachev, Lenin always insisted that Communists
could not succeed unless they managed to move and
*	control large masses. They count on being able to mobil-
ize a considerable part of the masses under Communist
leadership, although under non-Communist slogans and
appeals (e.g., land for the peasants, nationalism, democ-
j	racy). Other masses they seek to neutralize, that is, to
move to indifference with respect to the struggle, thus
denying their support to the enemy. These principles are
formulated in the concept of “alliances” and “neutraliza-
tion” which first emerge in Lenin’s “Two Tactics.”
The Communist concept of “revolutionary situation”
focuses on the kind of general crisis which would loosen
the bonds of allegiance, loyalty, and order to such an
extent that a minority can prevail against an enemy of
otherwise superior strength. “Only when the ‘lower
classes’ do not want the old way and when the ‘upper
classes’ cannot continue in the old way, then only can
revolution conquer” (Lenin, “Left-Wing Communism”).
'	In other words, troops, police, public institutions, laws,
and funds are all of no avail when two things coincide:
;	Panicky ineptness on the part of the rulers, and lack of
confidence and discipline on the part of the masses. A
power structure is never stronger than the immaterial
bonds holding it together. When the will to rule is gone
and the will to obey weakened, power disintegrates.
The multiplier effect of organizational key positions
is envisaged in the concept of “transmission belts,” or-
ganizations existing for ordinary, everyday needs and
ends in which relatively small cadres of Communists could
wield power over vast parts of society. Without changing
the raison d’etre of these organizations and their appeal
to the membership, the Communists in key positions
would use these structures to further the strategic inter-
ests of the party.
The Use of Force
Communists believe that the class struggle can neither
be fought nor won except by force. In keeping with their
basic assumption that theirs is a position of weakness,
however, they have used force sparingly, though system-
atically. Above all, force is never used apart from po-
litical persuasion and organization. A direct frontal attack
on enemy positions by force is not in the Communist con-
cept, which is based on the axiom of the adverse ratio
of power. The strategy is one of loosening, undermining,
infiltrating the enemy’s power structure and force is only
one among several factors brought to bear on the loyal-
ties of men to their present society and their present
leaders. As Mao Tse Tung put it: “War cannot for a
single moment be separated from politics. Any attitude
“ * * to belittle politics, to isolate war from politics, and
to become advocates of ‘war is everything,’ is erroneous
and must be corrected. * * * A gigantic national revolu-
tionary war as ours cannot succeed without universal and
thoroughgoing political mobilization” (“The Protracted
War”).
This principle has clearly guided Soviet practice. The
Soviets have seldom sought a direct decision mainly by
force. In most cases, they have employed force for its
terror (threat) effect. Especially against other nations,
the Soviets have preferred to use pressure for which mili-
tary force provided merely the background. While bran-
dishing a sword, they have nevertheless played on their
victims’ fears, reason, and moral convictions, and have
obtained something like “voluntary” surrender based on
such motives as resignation to the inevitable, assent to the
values invoked by Communists, and fear of dire con-
sequences.
It should also be remembered that Communist lead-
ers acquire certain habits in the long school of internecine
party struggles through which they have to pass before
they get to the top. In these struggles, force is invariably
used only to cap a victory already won by political means.
First the opponent is maneuvered onto the wrong side
of a political controversy while the ideological ground is
prepared on which he can be made to stumble. By a
series of maneuvers, the impression of an irresistible mo-
mentum is created, which causes the weight of numbers
to shift against him. An open debate is used to force him
into an admission of his error. Then, only then, does
force enter into the picture. These tactics have only
superficially changed since Stalin’s death.
One must assume that the habits of these methods
condition Communist leaders also in cold war operations,
although in international relations, the disposal of an
army-in-being introduces an instrument of force which
is not available in party conflicts. Khrushchev’s perform-
ance just before and after the abortive summit conference
seemed to be an almost direct application of tactical prin-
ciples learned in fighting party rivals. He prepared the
ideological ground, he thought he had Eisenhower on the
wrong side of a controversy, and his only miscalculation
was to assume that the world would or could be united in
indignation against American aggressiveness.
In general, it would stand to reason that the Soviets
would incline not to commit their armed strength to ex-
penditure in a head-on clash, but rather to use it as if it
were a bank reserve. In other words, armed power would
for them be more useful as an untouchable reserve en-
abling them to handle vastly more capital of political
power than bayonets would yield if engaged directly.
The Strategic Objective
The aim of Soviet strategy has been conceptually for-

Two grants totaling more than a quarter of a million
dollars have been awarded to University of Notre Dame
and Lobund Institute scientists for basic research proj-
ects which may eventually increase man’s understanding
of cancer and heart disease.
The larger of the two is a $200,000 grant from the
National Institutes of Health for a five-year program
with germfree animals. The project will seek basic in-
formation on the nutritional requirements of newborn
animals. This in turn will help the production of new
species of germfree animals by Caesarean operation, be
cause the newborn germfree animals have to be fed arti-
ficial formulas by hand and very little is known about
their actual needs.
The second grant is from the National Science Foun-
dation. It provides more than $50,000 for a three-year
program designed to determine how the presence of
bacteria affects the various proteins in the blood espe-
cially those proteins which are directly involved in the
fighting of infectious disease, the so-called antibodies.
Co-ordinating both projects is Dr. Bernard S. Wost-
mann, a biochemist who came to Lobund from the
University of Amsterdam almost five years ago. The
two projects dovetail, Wostmann said. The one being
underwritten by the National Science Foundation is a •
continuation of a project that had been carried on before
in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
In carrying out the nutritional research part of the
program, Dr. Wostmann’s technicians work with mice
bom by Caesarean section in the germfree environment
of plastic isolators.
The animals are fed every two hours with water-
soluble solutions whose components, such as amino acids
and sugar, can be varied to determine the animal’s nutri-
tional needs.
An additional objective is to try to learn whether
something in the animal’s diet plays a part in the forma-
tion of certain proteins, in particular gamma globulins,
found in the blood.
Scientists know, Wostmann pointed out, that the
bacteria found in normal animals promote the forma-
tion of antibodies which provide protection against
diseases. Part of these antibodies are gamma globulins.
Working with germfree animals, where no bacteria are
present, the role of nutritional elements in the formation
of gamma globulins can be measured.
If the experiment is successful, it could go far toward
revealing the basic defense mechanism of the body against
diseases.
All this is basic research, but it’s also highly compli-
cated. It requires scientists to walk a fine line between
reducing their problems to the simplest level on the one
hand, and oversimplification on the other.
At the same time that this research is carried on,
Wostmann’s team hopes to come up with new strains of
germfree animals for use in cancer research.
The availability of laboratory animals in germfree
condition can help scientists learn, for example, whether
or not the presence of bacteria makes a difference in the
development of cancers.
The animals also may prove useful in experiments into
the role of bacteria in the formation of cholesterol, a
fatty substance in the blood which is generally thought
to play an important part in certain forms of heart
disease.

THANKS
A
$ MILLION $
by
I
Rev. John A. O’Brien
The author heads a commission of the
National Conference of Christians and
Jews. He is well-known as a writer
and as a speaker. Father O’Brien has
been at Notre Dame since 1940 and
has previously contributed articles to
this magazine,
o
On the morning of Sept. 12, 1905, Ernie M. Morris,
a tall, broad-shouldered country lad, was riding horse-
back along the muddy roads of St. Joseph county, In-
diana. Before him loomed up in the distance, resplendent
in the morning sun, the golden dome of the Main
building of Notre Dame.
To the young farm boy, orphaned at 11 and almost
penniless, the shining dome stood as the symbol of learn-
ing. Within the youngster burned the fierce determina-
tion to study law.
Hitching his horse, Dexter, in front of the Main
building which then constituted much of the university,
the orphan knocked timidly on a door. A booming voice
called: “Come in.”
Entering, the youngster, still bespattered with mud,
found himself in the presence of a kindly looking priest,
Father John W. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., the youthful presi-
dent of Notre Dame.
“What can I do for you, my boy?” he asked.
“I want to get an education,” replied the boy, “but
I’m short of cash.” Pointing out the window to the horse
hitched below, he continued, “Dexter, there, is my sole
possession, but I’m willing to work . . . any kind of work.”
“We’ll manage to find something for you,” said the
president.
“But I might as well tell you at once,” added the
orphan boy, “I’m not a Catholic. I’m a Protestant—a
Presbyterian. Will that make any difference?”
“No,” replied the priest smiling at the youngster’s
forthright honesty, “Notre Dame was founded to help
deserving boys, regardless of creed or race.”
“Then there’s Dexter,” said the boy, “he’s the only
way I can get to school.”
“We’ll try to find a place for him, too,” laughed the
president.
The president led the orphan and his horse across the
campus to the barn. “Brother Hugh,” he said, “Dexter,
here, is bringing his young master to school. Find a spare
stall for him and give him some oats each day.”
Dexter and Ernie soon became a familiar sight on
the Notre Dame campus.
Ernie plunged into his studies with a vengeance. As
he rode home each evening, one arm would be full of
books while the other hand loosely held the reins of his
faithful “Dex.”
Law is no “pipe” course, Ernie soon discovered. He
needed all the time he could get after finishing the chores
on the farm where he was earning his room and board.
He noted that, strangely enough, the president had never
gotten around to assigning him a job to pay for his tuition.
As the law studies piled up, Ernie began to suspect
that the president had not forgotten about it, but know-
ing that the farm boy’s hands were already full, had pur-
posely refrained from asking him to do anything.
“Never once,” remarked Ernie, “did Father Cav-
anaugh ask me to do any work or even hint that the
scales were out of balance.”
Ernie finished his law course and was graduated
with honors.
The day,” said Ernie, “that old Colonel Hoyne, dean
of the law school, read off my name and Father Cav-
anaugh handed me the diploma, was the happiest day
of my life.”
The young graduate hung out his shingle and soon

had a thriving law business. Automobiles were just com-
ing into use and the young lawyer pioneered the plan of
helping people to purchase the new “horseless carriage”
on the installment plan.
His business prospered. Remembering his own tough
going as a youth, he became the champion of under-
privileged children, especially the crippled. He bought
a spacious mansion and turned it into a school for crip-
pled children.
During those years he often thought of the big-hearted
priest who had opened the doors of learning to a penniless
orphan boy and had even found a place for his horse.
One day, 44 years after his graduation, Ernie was
visiting the University as he had so often done in the past.
Dozens of stately buildings adorned the campus which
now seemed like a little city of learning. On the very
spot where Dexter once leisurely munched his oats now
stood a mighty stadium where the Fighting Irish battle
the great teams of the land. On that team, he knew,
Jews, Protestants, and Catholics stand shoulder to shoul-
der and their names sounded like a roll call of the
United Nations delegates.
Knocking on the president’s door, Ernie heard a
friendly voice call, “Come in.” It was another Cav-
anaugh—John J.—who welcomed him now. Smiling
and friendly, too.
Ernie recalled how the other president had befriended
him 50 years ago.
“I’ve had a warm spot in my heart,” Ernie said, “for
Notre Dame ever since. I never got over a Catholic
school doing what it did for a poor Protestant boy. Just
to show you that I haven’t forgotten, here is a little
check for Notre Dame.”
The president looked at the check and wondered if
he could believe his eyes. No wonder. It was a check
for a million dollars! A lump formed in the president’s
throat and there was a mist in his eyes as he clasped the
hand of the tall gray haired man in gratitude.
“So you’re grateful,” he said, “to old Father Cav-
anaugh for an education.” Then he smiled. “So am I,”
he confided, “for it was he who gave me a chance to
work my way through school, as his secretary.”
“Well, that’s interesting,” commented the late J. P.
McAvoy, the noted columnist who happened to be visit-
ing there at the time, “it was he who gave me a job, too,
so I could get an education.”
“But,” queried Ernie, “did he ever get around to
assigning you a job?”
“Did he?” replied McAvoy. “I’ll say he did! I waited
upon the regular waiters!”
“That’s more than interesting to me,” chuckled Ernie,
“that’s positively revealing. I see now that there was
nothing wrong with Father Cavanaugh’s memory. He
didn’t forget to find jobs for you two Catholic boys, but
he was too big hearted to assign any work to a poor
Protestant orphan who was already loaded down with
farm chores after school. He conveniently forgot about
the work I was supposed to do, but I never forgot it.”
The stately Morris inn at the entrance of the campus
stands like the friendly “House by the Side of the Road,”
offering warmth and shelter to friends and visitors of all
faiths. It offers tangible and impressive evidence that the
orphan boy did not forget the generous action of the big
Ernest M. Morris (right) with Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C.
and J. P. McEvoy. Both Mr. Morris and Mr. McEvoy are
now deceased.
hearted priest 54 years ago. Like the bread cast upon the
waters, Father Cavanaugh’s gift to the orphan boy came
back a hundredfold.
Soviet Strategy
(Continued from page 7)
mulated by Stalin through the term “overwhelmingly su-
perior strength.” This concept should be taken quite
literally. It connotes an edge in military, political, and
social power which has overwhelming effects on those on
whom it is brought to bear. Once “overwhelmingly su-
perior strength” is attained by the Soviet, they would
expect to be able to talk other countries into submission,
one by one. Their methods in the case of the Baltic
Republics are quite instructive as to how they would
expect to accomplish this. Stalin also described the stra-
tegic objective in terms of converting the present “capi-
talist encirclement” into “socialist encirclement,” which
amounts to the same thing as “overwhelmingly superior
strength.” Since Stalin’s death, Khrushchev seems to have
come to the conclusion that the “socialist camp” is no
longer “encircled,” but is not yet strong enough to “en-
circle” the capitalist world.
Change in Strategy
From 1943 to 1953, the Soviets used a strategy of
territorial expansion, pushing into areas which were in-
differently held by the West. In response to this strategy,
a tremendous strengthening of the Western Powers of
resistance occurred. The West rearmed rapidly and
effectively and established a series of alliances which led
to the deployment of Armed Forces around the periphery
of the Soviet orbit. The armed and organized strength
of the Western Powers now constitutes the single most
effective obstacle to Soviet policy. It is so formidable a
power structure that the Soviets, in keeping with their
strategic doctrine are not likely to contemplate a direct
attack on it.
Since 1953, they have therefore concentrated on
methods of indirect attack against the Western Power

for reasons of health, Father
Hesburgh said.
The Notre Dame Foun-

sional staff of eleven laymen,
coordinates the University’s
public relations and development activities. It currently
is engaged in a three-year, nationwide, $18,000,000

cation department since 1957 and a member of the
faculty since 1953 when he received his doctorate at
Yale University. A specialist in the philosophy of edu-
cation, he addressed the White House Conference on
Children and Youth last year. In addition to his teach-
ing and administrative duties, Father Walsh has served
as liaison between the University administration and the
Women’s Advisory Council and the Notre Dame Library
Association.
A native of Jackson, Nebraska, and a former resident
of Milwaukee, Father Walsh entered Holy Cross Semi-
nary on the Notre Dame campus in 1940, receiving an
undergraduate degree from the University in 1945.
After four years of theological studies at Holy Cross
College, Washington, D. C., he was ordained to the
priesthood on June 8, 1949, in Notre Dame’s Sacred
Heart Church by the late Archbishop John F. Noll of
Fort Wayne.

position. These methods follow, by and large, the pattern
of the strategy they have used in most situations: The
mobilization of large masses, simultaneously with the neu-
tralization of other masses; attempts to deprive the ruling
elements in the West of both will and capacity to govern,
and the ruled elements of the will to abide by established
leadership; endeavors to occupy organizational key
positions.
Dr. Niemeyer’s comments on “Soviet Strategy
and Free World Defense” will be concluded
in the next issue of NOTRE DAME.
Pangborn Honored by
Pope John XXIII
Thomas W. Pangborn, Hagerstown, Md., industrialist
and philanthropist and a member of Notre Dame’s As-
sociate Board of Lay Trustees, has been named a Private
Papal Chamberlain of the Sword and Gape by His Holi-
ness Pope John XXIII. Mr. Pangborn’s generosity to
the University of Notre Dame is highlighted by Pang-
born Hall, a student residence, which was erected as the
result of contributions from him and his brother, the
late John C. Pangborn, through the Pangborn Foun-
dation.
Private Papal Chamberlains of the Sword and Cape
were created by Pope Urban VIII in the seventeenth
century. They are members of the Pontifical family and
in precedence they follow the prelates of the Church.
Papal Chamberlains are selected by the Holy See from
distinguished laymen in recognition for outstanding work
done in the service of the Church.
Mr. Pangborn was named a Knight of Malta in
1949 and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre in 1951. In
1955 he was elevated to the rank of Knight Grand Cross
of the Holy Sepulchre and four years later Pope John
named him Knight of St. Gregory.
He is to be congratulated for this singular honor
which is rarely awarded outside of Europe. Mr. Pang-
born is the second citizen of the United States to be so
designated by His Holiness Pope John XXIII for this
high office. Notre Dame awarded an honorary doctor of
laws degree to Mr. Pangborn in 1954.

NOTRE DAME
Alumni and Other Friends to Be
The University of Notre Dame will receive a grant
of $6,000,000 from The Ford Foundation provided that
during the next three years it obtains $12,000,000 in
gifts from its alumni and friends.
Notre Dame is one of five privately supported Amer-
ican universities chosen by The Ford Foundation for
participation in its new $46,000,000 Special Program in
Education. The other institutions and the unrestricted
grants earmarked for them are Stanford University,
$25,000,000* The Johns Hopkins University, $6,000,000;
University of Denver, $5,000,000; and Vanderbilt Uni-
versity, $4,000,000.
Henry T. Heald, president of the Foundation, said
the objective of the new program is “to assist institutions
in different regions of the country to reach and sustain
a wholly new level of academic excellence, administrative
effectiveness and financial support.” He said the five
schools were selected because they had “already embarked
on future-development programs commensurate in scope,
imagination and practicability to the vast needs of Amer-
ican society.”
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., President of
Notre Dame, in response to the challenging new Ford
Foundation program, designated five “top priority” proj-
ects in a three-year, $18,000,000 fund-raising effort.
Heading the list is the recently announced Notre Dame
Memorial Library to be built at a cost of $8,000,000.
The other segments of the $18,000,000 goal are $4,000,-
000 for two graduate residence halls; $3,500,000 for in-
creased faculty salaries and endowed professorships;
$2,000,000 for fellowships, scholarships and student loans;
and $500,000 for special administrative purposes including
a retirement plan for non-academic employees.
Under terms of the Special Program in Education,
all of the universities except Stanford are required to
raise two dollars from private sources for each dollar of
The Ford Foundation grant over the next three years.
Stanford is required to match the grant three-for-one
over the next five years. Funds to match the Foundation’s
grant must come from other private sources and not the
government or other Ford Foundation programs or
affiliates.
In regard to this new program Father Hesburgh has
stated:
“The participation of The University of Notre Dame
in The Ford Foundation’s Special Program in Education
is, in a sense, an answer to our deepest hopes. This pro-
gram will make it possible for Notre Dame to take a
great leap forward in its striving for academic excellence.
The grant is not, however, merely an answer. It is even
more a challenge, by making unusual help available if
we can first help ourselves. Some years ago, The Ford
Foundation awarded Notre Dame more than $3,000,000
for faculty development. On that occasion, we were able
in the three subsequent years to double the fund, thanks
to our many loyal alumni and friends who contributed
for this same purpose to the great betterment of our
faculty, and students, too.
“Now the challenge has been broadened and deep-
ened. The $6,000,000 earmarked by The Ford Founda-
tion for payment over the next three years to Notre
Dame is contingent upon our raising an additional
$12,000,000 from our alumni and friends. The total will
provide funds at an early date for Notre Dame’s most
urgent needs: a magnificent new library, faculty develop-
ment, graduate and undergraduate scholarships, exciting
new academic programs that deepen the impact of the
University on the need for wisdom and excellence in
our times.
“We are indeed grateful to The Ford Foundation for
this farsighted beneficence: for in helping us and others,
in the broadest sense they are demonstrating how much
we need to be helped to achieve our dreams for many
great universities across this land.
