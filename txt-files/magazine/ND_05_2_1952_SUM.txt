Ike Wins in Mock Political
CONVENTION
Notre Dame Student Academy of Political Science
Sponsors Facsimile of Republican Convention
The Warren delegation was
strong and had the signs to back
up their enthusiasm. The Cali-
fornia governor won the vice-
presidential nomination after his
following decided to support the
Eisenhower faction. ‘Honey Bear’
came in for plenty of admiring
glances from the students.
ALL the trimmings of a national po-
xX. litical convention, including ban-
ners, parades, brass bands, nominating
speeches, and voting by state delega-
tions highlighted a four-day conclave
staged by the Student Academy of Po-
litical Science recently at Notre Dame.
It was decided to hold a Republican
convention because of the time element
since much planning and organizing
Senator Taff made a battle of it and lost by a few votes.
)•
went into the four-day affair and also
because of nationwide interest mani-
fested in the ireal) G.O.P. nomination.
Originated by Professor Paul Bar-
tholomew, Acting Head of the Political
Science Department, as a practical
phase in American political education,
this year’s convention was the third in
the University’s history.

the occasion;
in 1940, while the Republicans had
the “floor” in 1948. None was sched-
uled for ’44 because of World War II.
More than 3,000 students filled the
Navy drill hall for the final session,
which ended with the presidential nom-
ination for General Dwight D. Eisen-
hower on the seventh ballot. Governor
Earl Warren won the vice-presidential
nomination after “his” delegates de-
cided to support the Eisenhower effort.
Every delegation was allowed as
many votes as their state will have in
the national convention this Summer
in Chicago. Approximately 1,200 stu-
dents actually participated in the con-
vention’s sessions as members of state
delegations.
Committees for each of the candi-
dates — Warren, Eisenhower, Taft,
Stassen, Gen. MacArthur, Paul Hoff-
man, Senator Morse, Senator Dirksen
and Governor Davis Lodge — cam-
paigned in a manner suggestive of what
will probably take place at the national
convention in June. The Warren dem-
onstrations featured not only a large
following but in addition two students
with snare drums who provided the
“music.” Those supporting Eisenhower
used the services of a seven-piece band.
Many Vetville wives and St. Mary’s
College students participated in the va-
rious demonstrations. An electric or-
gan and a loud siren helped to create
plenty of background effect. Of 1,205
votes cast General Eisenhower received
730. Senator Taft captured 459 votes.
Dr. Bartholomew stated that the
1952 mock convention far exceeded
any previous affairs of this type held
at Notre Dame in both enthusiasm and
size.

IF you ask a student what a parasite
is he might tell you it’s his room-
mate or the guy down the hall who is
always bumming smokes and books.
If you ask Dr. John D. Mizelle, over
in the Biology building, he will tell
you it is a plant or animal living in
or on the expense of another plant or
animal. He might add that parasites
are his life’s work.
Dr. Mizelle, a parasitologist, is at
present engaged in experimentation
with a particular kind of parasite, the
sheep stomach worm. This might
sound like just another worm, another
experiment. But to sheep and cattle
ranchers, wool exporters and lamb
chop lovers, Dr. Mizelle’s work is of
real importance. Over a million
pounds of mutton and uncalculated
bales of wool are lost yearly because
of this parasite.
These worms, which live in the
fourth stomach of sheep, are blood-
suckers. The female worms lay eggs
inside the sheep. The eggs then pass
out in manure, and larvae hatch from
them during the warmer months.
These larvae feed and shed their skins
two times and in the last stage be-
come infective. They live on the grass
of the pasture and are transmitted to
the sheep when the animals feed.
This sounds simple enough but the
battle against the worms is not so
simple mainly because the infective
larvae are microscopic and almost im-
possible to detect. The experiments
at this time are directed to determin-
ing the rate of development under dif-
ferent conditions of temperature and
humidity. Joe Berberian, a graduate
student, is assisting Dr. Mizelle in this
work. The next step is to develop
a chemical spray that will kill the
larvae. The spray must be fairly in-
expensive, easy to manufacture, and,
of course, harmless to all animals
grazing in the pasture. This part of
the research will be by far the hard-
est. Dr. Mizelle estimates it will take
at least three years.
Dr. Mizelle got his idea for experi-
ments with sheep worms while serving
in the Army Medical Corps, from
Unique Study of
Sheep Parasites
In Progress at ND
By Paul Dembinski
The Aminco cabinet (opened) in which the eggs and larvae of the sheep
stomach worm are incubated under different conditions of temperature and
humidity. This apparatus permits the establishment of “climatic” conditions
which simulate those in the grazing pastures where sheep are kept.

1928 to 1930. It wasn’t until the fall
of last year however, that he managed
to get Armour Meat Packing Go., in
Chicago interested in his work. Since
then Armour has sponsored the re-
search and even supplies the eggs of
the worm. Most of the equipment,
however, was already on the premises
since s experiments of this type had
been going on for a number of years.
Nowhere else in the United States is
experimentation of this kind being
done with this sheep parasite.
Even without his present experi-
ments with sheep worms, Dr. Mizelle
has a busy schedule. He edits the
American Midland Naturalist, teaches
class and directs graduate student re-
searches.
The cabinet immediately in
front of Dr. Mizelle literally
makes the “climatic” condi-
tions with regard to desired
combinations of temperature
and humidity and for this rea-
son is known as a Climatizer.
It houses heating coils, a
cooling device, several spray
heads, and fans for blowing
the “weather" into the cabi-
net shown on page 8.
He graduated from Louisiana State
University in 1933 and received his
Ph.D. at the University of Illinois in
1937. He served in the Medical Corps
and was a reserve officer in the Army
from 1933 to 1941.
Dr. Mizelle’s quiet experiment may
influence the lives of everyone. If
the parasite is licked, prices of mutton
and wool should drop. That will mean
somewhat lower grocery and clothing
bills; it will mean another slight boost

Night or day, the little home of the
Department of Architecture at Notre
Dame is a crowded one—so crowded,
in fact, that in 1948 a cube-shaped
annex was added. The annex now
houses the 3,000-volume departmental
library and freshman design room.
Two other design rooms are in the
main part of the building, along with

a freehand drawing room, two lecture
rooms, offices, and an exhibition cor-
ridor. The corridor is lined with de-
signs ready to be judged by Mr. Frank
Montana, the department head, and
his staff. The students themselves
discuss their work with the faculty
judges, a unique innovation recently
introduced.
This building, which once housed
the Department of Chemistry and
later the College of Law, was taken
over by the architects in 1930. The
Department of Architecture, however,
has had a prominent place at Notre
Dame since it first became a depart-
ment of the College of Engineering
in 1898.
Today, the 156 students enrolled in
the department follow a five-year
course for a bachelor of architecture
degree. Religion, English, philosophy,
chemistry, mathematics, supplement
the many hours devoted to architec-
ture and engineering courses.
As an added incentive to the as-
piring architect, several prizes are
available, notably three awards total-
ing $500 offered by the Indiana Lime-
stone Institute for problems in church
design.
The student architects maintain
close contact with such professional
groups and the Beaux Arts Institute
of Design in their social activities as
well as their class work. In fact, one
of the most well-organized groups on
campus is the Notre Dame Student
Chapter of the American Institute of
Architecture. The club offers the stu-
dents representation in departmental
policies, educational and social bene-
fits, and automatic membership in the
professional AIA upon graduation.
How well-equipped these student
architects will be when they graduate
may be seen in the work of their
predecessors at Notre Dame, work
that ranges from the classic Cuban
Capitol in Havana to LeMans Hall at
nearby St. Mary’s College.
The skilled architects on the faculty
are not to be outdone by their pupils.
Mr. Vito Girone, for example, has
designed and built a “solar house,”
which now stands on a South Bend
hilltop.
To judge from the work they have
done and the spirit in which they
have done it, Notre Dame’s student
architects should become able masters
of the complicated art of architecture.

CCTHIRST of all, understand, I am
a Ukrainian” So emphatically
stated Dr. Michael Pap, special re-
search assistant to the Notre Dame
Committee on International Relations.
“There is quite a difference, you
see, between being a Russian and a
Ukrainian. In 1654, the Ukraine,
which up to that time had been free
and independent, made the bad mis-
take of forming a ‘defensive’ alliance
with the Russians. Bohdan Chmel-
nytzky, hetman of the Ukraine, con-
cluded the treaty and was never seen
again.
“In 1864, the Russian Foreign Of-
fice declared that there never had
been any such place as the Ukraine.
This they thought effectively disposed
of all resistance. How wrong they
were I”
Dr. Pap, a 31-year-old Ph.D. from
Heidelberg University, is now prepar-
ing several articles on the difficulties
of the Russians in the Ukraine.
Born in the Carpathian part of the
Ukraine, once a part of Czechoslo-
vakia, he attended the Gymnasium at
Bratislava and in 1942, due to the
assassination of Reinhard “Hangman”
Heydrich, the Gauleiter of Occupied
Czechoslovakia, he and many other
anti-Nazi students were brought to
Austria as a forced labor group to
work in the I. G. Farben Works there.
While there, he learned much about
the inner workings of the U.S.S.R.
from the many former citizens in-
terned in the camp. “They were all
bitter. When the Soviets came to ‘lib-
erate’ us in the latter part of the war,
none of us wanted to be ‘liberated’.”
Dr. Pap fled Austria and went to
Heidelberg, where he obtained his
doctorate in Political Science.
After graduating from Heidelberg in
1948, Dr. Pap worked with the Inter-
national Refugee Organization.
“There, it was the same old story,”
he relates. “Students from the Soviet
or from satellite countries did not
want to go back behind the Iron Cur-
tain. We had a great deal of diffi-
culty with the Soviet Reparations
Commission; they kept telling the re-
luctant students that it was their duty
to their Motherland.”
From New York, Dr. Pap pro-
ceeded to Detroit, where he got a job
with the Chrysler Corporation. He

says that he was the only machinist
that could speak eight languages
(German, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak,
Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, and Eng-
fish) .
In 1950, he came to South Bend
and got in touch with Dr. Waldemar
Gurian, chairman of the Committee
on International Relations, who ob-
tained for him the position of special
research assistant to the committee.
Because of his obvious knowledge of
the Ukraine (his doctoral thesis was
entitled The Problems of Ukrainian
Statehood and Immigration), Dr. Pap
was next questioned concerning the
Ukraine in the Kremlin scheme of
things to come.
“After the Russian Foreign Office’s
idea of declaring it non-existent in
1864, its revolutionary activities were
dormant until the Russian Revolu-
tions of 1917-1920, when aUkrainian-
Government-in-Exile under the lead-
ership of Alexander Levitsky emerged
and began advocating for a free and
independent Ukraine. Despite the
thorough penetration of the Com-
munist Dogma elsewhere, the Ukrain-
ians still do not regard Russia as
their country.
“In 1941, when the Nazis came, the
Ukrainian Partisan Army, deceived by
their promises, joined them in the
fight against the Soviets. Too late,
they found the Germans were no bet-
ter than the Russians. They then
switched sides and were annihilated
by both sides. Over 270,000 men un-
der the leader of the Hetman, Bulbar,
were slain before the war ended.
“That was generally considered to
be the last of the Ukrainian Nation-
alist Army, but there are some rumors
that there are a few still in hiding.
This seems to be borne out by the
fact that a group of about 170 got
through the Iron Curtain to Vienna
last year, and they reported that there

was still resistance to the Soviets in
the Ukraine.
“This fact and the fact that over
300,000 D.P.’s from the Ukraine are
still resisting efforts to have them
returned under the Yalta agreement
will be an important source of strength
against the Soviets.
“Any way you look at it, the West-
ern World has some good staunch
allies in the Ukraine, if the struggle
for freedom be forced upon them by
the Soviets. The Ukrainians are old
hands at the game of fighting Rus-
sians. They have been doing it since
1654.”

Socony-Vacuum Renews
Chemistry Fellowship
The Socony-Vacuum Laboratories of
Paulsboro, N. J., have announced the
sixth renewal of a Fellowship in Chem-
istry at the University of Notre Dame.
The $2,000 grant from the Socony-
Vacuum Laboratories, which will ex-
tend from September 1, 1952, to Au-
gust 31, 1953, is given for research in
physical or organic chemistry at Notre
Dame. An outstanding graduate stu-
dent in his second or third year of
graduate study in the Notre Dame De-
partment of Chemistry annually is the
recipient of the grant.
Recipient of the 1952-53 Socony-
Vacuum grant will be Richard T. Mc-
Bride, who before enrolling in the
Notre Dame Graduate School was with
the E. I. duPont de Nemours Com-
pany. McBride, who also has taken
graduate work in chemistry at the

Notre Dame Senior Wins
Scholarship for 1952-53
A University of Notre Dame senior
is one of fourteen students from col-
leges and universities throughout the
United States to be awarded scholar-
ships for the 1952-53 schoolyear by the
American Council of Learned Societies.
Frank J. Haendler, Notre Dame sen-
ior history student from Chicago, Ill.,
will use the scholarship, awarded for
first year graduate study in one of the
humanities, to study Modern German
History at the Harvard University
Graduate School. Haendler will receive
a Bachelor of Arts degree with Maxi-
ma Cum Laude honors from Notre
Dame in June.
In selecting the scholarship recipi-
ents, the American Council of Learned
Societies invited more than 300 colleges
and universities to nominate candi-
dates. The fourteen recipients were
selected from the nominees submitted.

Outstanding Awards to
N. D. and Fr. Cavanaugh
The University of Notre Dame has
been cited by the Institute of Interna-
tional Education in New York for an
“outstanding contribution to the ad-
vancement of world understanding”
and Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C.,
president of the university, has been
awarded a certificate for “bettering the
foreign relations of the United States
through the medium of the interna-
tional exchange of persons.” The cita-
tion was given because of the univer-
sity’s acceptance of foreign students on
the local campus. Notre Dame is a
member of the institute.
Fred Waring featured John Noland, Notre Dame glee club soloist, on his
General Electric television program, recently.
Fred Snite, Sr., Gives
Valuable Volumes to N. D.
Two rare extra-illustrated sets of the
Works of William Shakespeare have
been given to the University of Notre
Dame by Fred Snite, Sr., Chicago, HL,
business executive.
The two gift sets, one in twenty-nine
volumes and one in fifteen volumes,
have been appraised at $14,000. Both

THE MARINES
Have Landed...
R. O. T. C. Program on Campus Features Course For Future Leathernecks
By Ray Humble
66/^ ENTLEMEN! Our problem
V_J is to take this island. Our
first assault will be at this point.”
Marine Major Andrew M. Zimmer
pointed toward a beach and to the
troops and ships and planes that
would soon strike like a great iron
claw. Major Zimmer, formerly with
the first Marine Brigade in Korea,
was talking to a group of 11 senior
Naval ROTC students at Notre Dame.
The model, which is composed of
small airplanes, ships, landing craft
and beach, is used in the study of the
;hip-to-shore movement of an am-
phibious assault. The ship to shore
movement is studied as part of the
course of amphibious warfare.
Besides taking the course in am-
phibious warfare senior Naval ROTC
students study leadership and military
justice. Map-reading, weapons, and
small unit tactics are a part of the
laboratory work which is covered in
the senior and junior years.
Junior marine candidates take
courses dealing with a study of mili-
tary history. During the first semes-
ter they study the history of art of
war, which includes the evolution of
weapons, tactics and strategy from the
battle of Marathon, 490 B.C., to the
present day. Also principles of war
are analyzed through selected Euro-
pean battles in the first semester. In
the second semester course the junior
candidates for commissions in the
Marine Corps study all the wars of
the United States from the revolution
to the second world war. The course,
called United States Military History
and Policy, also includes a brief in-
sight into military history and foreign

policy. All courses are credited
towards a degree by the University
of Notre Dame.
Sophomore Naval ROTC students
can select the Marine Corps by ap-
plying to the Marine Officer Instruc-
tor, Major Zimmer, in the spring of
their sophomore year. Sixteen and
one-half percent of the Naval ROTC
students can be accepted into the Ma-
rine Corps Training program. Notre
Dame, as one of the 52 universities
having ROTC units, has had, in the
past, one of the highest percentages of
Naval students wanting to become
second lieutenants in the Marines. At
the present time, there are 11 senior
and 9 junior students taking training
towards a commission in the Marine
Corps.
Besides being the Marine Officer In-
structor, Major Zimmer, who was sta-
tioned aboard the U.S.S. Pittsburgh
during World War II, is the procure-
ment officer of the Platoon Leaders
Course and the Officers Candidate
Course. The PLC, Platoon Leaders
Course, is open to underclassmen who
want to become second lieutenants in
the Marines and are not in Naval
ROTC. The OCC, Officers Candi-
date Course, is open to senior and
graduate students who want to be sec-
ond lieutenants.
Major Zimmer, the father of three
boys, was the executive officer of the
First Provisional Casual company at
Camp Otsu, Japan, in August of 1950.
Mr. Humble is from Denver, Colo.,
and is majoring in Journalism. He is
a staff member of the Notre Dame
Scholastic, student news weekly.
He has an assistant instructor, Tech-
nical Sergeant James Sova.
By using the model, which is sent
to the unit by headquarters in Wash-
ington, and through the use of train-
ing films the R.O.T.C. student learns a
large amount of the theory of amphib-
ious warfare and obtains a small insight
into the practical side of con-
ducting a ship-to-shore movement
against a defended island. Through
the study of military history and past
wars, coupled with a concentrated
laboratory study in practical work,

students aspiring to become marine
officers graduate from Notre Dame
with a well-grounded military educa-
tion for future service in the Marine
Corps.
This bit of military knowledge will
help the future marine officers to
stage an invasion, if one is ever
needed again, and they will be able
to properly answer the statement,
“Gentlemen, our problem is to take
this island and our assault will be at
this point.”

N.D. Student
Descendant
of
Japanese
Emperor
By Tom Bennett
A DESCEND ANT of a fourth cen-
tury Japanese emperor, who
“talked his way out” of an intern-
ment camp in order to continue his
education, currently is working toward
a doctorate degree at the University
of Notre Dame preparatory to enter-
ing the field of education in Hawaii.
The Japanese emperor’s descendant
at Notre Dame is Harold S. Shira-
kawa, who is serving as a Teaching
Fellow in the University’s Department
of Biology while completing work for
his doctorate degree. He is specializ-
ing in botany.
Shirakawa, a native of Los Angeles,
Calif., explains that his family stems
from the Japanese royal line of Shira-
kawa, Emperor of Japan around 325
A.D.
“My father, who was a viscount of
the royal family, left Japan when he
was quite young, contrary to the cus-
tom of the nobility who prefer royal
children to live a completely sheltered
and inactive life,” the Notre Dame
botanist points out. “When my father
died the Japanese government offered
the title to the males in our family.
We refused the title, however, since
we were brought up in America and
had no intention of returning to
Japan.”
Shirakawa’s education at the City
The author formerly was a student
assistant in the University’s Public In-
formation Department.
Mr. Shirakawa
College of Los Angeles was inter-
rupted by Pearl Harbor, when ori-
entals were moved from the west
coast. One of his brothers served
with the famed Japanese-American
442nd combat team throughout World
War II, but Harold and his mother
were interned along with 22,000
others. The first six months of their
internment was spent at a temporary
camp at the Santa Anita race track,
before they were moved further in-
land to a camp in Colorado.
Recalling his stay at the Santa
Anita camp (during which time, he
wistfully reminisces, there were no
races because the stables had been
converted to living quarters), Harold
describes the period as a “pretty
rough six months.”
“It was terribly crowded and most
of us were broke,” according to the
emperor’s descendant. “Though we
could get employment within the
camp, the wages were only $9.00 per
month. Most of us were city folks
who weren’t used to ‘roughing it.’
The quarters were so small that every-
one had to buy a card table that
could be folded up, because there was
no room for a standard table.”
Although the Shirakawas found the
permanent camp in Colorado much
more comfortable, Harold stayed only
two weeks before “talking his way
out” to continue his education.
“I told the camp director my ambi-
tions toward completing my educa-
tion, and asked him point-blank how
he would like to waste his life in a
camp. He asked me if I had any
money or a job—I had neither, but I
had enough high hopes to gloss over
the misinformation—and then he gave
me official permission to leave the
camp. I was amazed.”
Harold worked in the dining hall
at the University of Colorado for a
few weeks to save enough money to
come East, and then took a job with
a wholesale book company in Chi-
cago. He stayed there until he had
enough money to enroll at Muskingum
College, New Concord, O.
“I was always interested in biology,
but had studied business administra-
tion at the City College of Los An-
geles so I could begin to support my
mother more quickly,” he explains.
“Since Muskingum really was a new
16
Notre Dame
start, and since mother was being
cared for at the camp, I had no im-
mediate responsibilities. I decided,
therefore, to enroll in the science
school.”
Harold was graduated from Musk-
ingum College in 1946, and immedi-
ately was drafted into the Army for a
seventeen month hitch. It was while
serving with the Army, and during
a visit to the Muskingum campus,
that he met his bride-to-be, who later
invited him to a sorority dance.
His wife’s home is on Kauai, one
of the islands near Hawaii, where they
were married. This is one reason why
Shirakawa wants to settle in Hawaii.
More important, however, he calls
the islands the “perfect society.”
There are representatives there of all
the races and nearly all the nations
of the world, and they all live in har-
mony, he explains. “They practice
what we in America preach,” the
Notre Dame botanist muses.
Not only is there a near-perfect so-
cial life, but Shirakawa points out that
there is tremendous opportunity in his
field of botany, where he says no sig-
nificant paper on botanical science has
been produced for the past twenty-
five years.
That’s why this descendant of the
fourth-century Japanese emperor, Shi-
rakawa, defied all obstacles to com-
plete his education at Notre Dame.
And that’s why he will sail for Hawaii
as soon as he receives his doctorate
degree — to utilize his Notre Dame
training toward the end of lifting
just a bit higher these “near perfect”
islands of Hawaii.

Robert Finney Awarded
G-E Co. Scholarship
A University of Notre Dame junior
electrical engineering student is one of
twenty-four engineering students from
colleges and universities throughout the
United States to be selected for scholar-
ships awarded by the General Electric
Company.
Robert G. Finney, of Kansas City,
Mo., will be the recipient of the Gen-
eral Electric $500 scholarship during
his senior year in the College of En-
gineering at Notre Dame. Finney, who
holds a 91% scholastic average in the
Notre Dame engineering school, has
been named Editor of the Scholastic,
student newsweekly published at Notre
Dame, for the 1952-53 schoolyear.
Recipients of the General Electric
scholarships were selected by the Gen-
eral Electric Professors’ Conference
Association. Nation-wide candidates
were judged on the basis of scholarship,
campus activities and employment rec-
ord, evidence of ingenuity, resourceful-
ness and leadership.
Chemistry Teachers to
Have Training Program
A Chemistry Teacher Training Pro-
gram for secondary school and college
chemistry teachers will be conducted
from June 20 to August 5 during the
1952 Summer Session at the University
of Notre Dame, according to an an-
nouncement by the Rev. James E. Nor-
ton, C.S.C., Vice-President in Charge
of Academic Affairs at Notre Dame.
Objective of the Notre Dame train-
ing program is to bring to secondary
school and college teachers a back-
ground of information and training in
chemistry and related fields especially
suited to the needs of these teachers
and their students.
The program is being offered because
of the increasing demand of society for
trained scientists, which places in-
creased responsibilities on teachers of
science to inspire and to train qualified
students able to understand their re-
sponsibilities and to recognize their
opportunities for promoting human
welfare.
Successful completion of the train-
ing program leads to the Master of
Science degree. Complete information
regarding the program may be obtained
by writing Dr. Charles C. Price, Head
of the Department of Chemistry at
Notre Dame.
