THE ZAHM
DANTE LIBRARY
By Rufus William Rauch
The author has been teaching English
literature, at Notre Dame for the past
thirty years. He received a bachelor’s
degree from Loras College and a
master’s from the State University of
Iowa in 1925. Prior to accepting a
position at Notre Dame, Professor
Rauch taught at Marquette University
from 1925-27. He was a Visiting Tutor
and Great Books Lecturer at St. John’s
College, Annapolis, Md., in 1946-47.
Professor Rauch has written numerous
articles in America, Catholic World.,
American Review and the Review of
Politics. He is married and the
father of five children.
Professor Rauch has been elected
president of the Notre Dame Faculty
Club for the 1957-58 schoolyear. In
recent years he has been working on a
large book, called “A Companion to
Dante.”
One of the less well known but
nevertheless notable treasures of the
University of Notre Dame in its in-
tellectual and cultural heritage is the
Zahm Dante Library. This great col-
lection of valuable books is one of the
finest of its kind in the United States.
It is named in memory of its founder,
the Reverend John A. Zahm, C.S.C.,
the distinguished scientist, educator,
apologist—popular lecturer and book
collector also—who flourished at Notre
Dame in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth century. Father Zahm was
a man of wide interests and many
accomplishments. One of the earliest
Notre Dame scientists, he worked
particularly in geology and zoology,
and in evolutionary theory. He was
responsible, as vice president of the
University, for the building of Old
Science Hall (now reconstructed into
the LaFortune Student Center) and
the collecting of materials for the Sci-
ence Museum. He travelled extensive-
ly in the Southwest, in South America,
where he was associated with Theo-
dore Roosevelt in a famous geographi-
cal and exploratory expedition, and in
his latter years in Europe. He was the
author of many volumes, on scientific
subjects, on South American explora-
tion, and on the relation between Chris-
tian dogma and the then new and
highly controversial hypotheses of evo-
lution. For a relatively short time he
held executive posts in the University
and in the Congregation of Holy Cross,
serving for a term as vice president,
then as American provincial, and final-
ly as procurator-general in Rome.
With these multifarious activities

Notre Dame
and professional duties in the earlier
part of his career, Father Zahm de-
veloped a great interest in and enthu-
siasm for the life and works of Dante
Alighieri, the greatest of all Christian
poets. It was said of Zahm at the
time of his death in 1921, by Father
John W. Cavanaugh who had known
him intimately, that as faithfully as
Father Zahm said his daily Mass and
office he was in the habit of reading
at least one canto of the Divine Com-
edy every day before retiring.
It was this love of Dante’s divine
poem that made Father Zahm an avid
and very successful collector of books
by and about Dante. There have
probably been more books written
about Dante, his life, his works, their
meaning and value, more editions and
translations of his works into all the
various modem languages, than is the
case with any other writer ancient or
modem, including Shakespeare. And
to collect a first-rate scholarly Dante
library today, not to say a definitive
one, would require the resources of a.
millionaire, and even with unlimited
resources the task would be almost im-
possible.
Zahm began his collection privately
in the early years of the century, prob-
ably with money earned from the royal-
ties on his own books, at a time when
some of the great private libraries in
Italy and in England were being dis-
persed. There was a remarkable re-
vival of interest in Dante throughout
the Western world during the nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries,,
especially in England and the United
States; among collectors and the great
institutional libraries the market was
very lively. Even so, though prices for
rare and early editions rose rapidly, the
money value of such volumes will have
multiplied many times over in the
years since then. The Fisk Dante Li-
brary at Cornell University was formed
at that time; the Charles Eliot Norton
private collection had been bequeathed
to Harvard to form the nucleus of the
Dante collection in the Widener Li-
brary there. These three, the Fisk, the
Widener and the Zahm, are the richest
Dante collections in the Western hemis-
phere.
The Zahm Dante Library consists
now of about 4000 volumes, from the
earliest printed editions to the latest
critical works in various languages and
the current issues of the scholarly Dante
journals. Of the fifteen incunable
editions of the Divine Comedy (those
printed before 1500) the Zahm Library
has copies of eight, including a copy
of the first Florentine edition, 1481,
notable for its engraved illustrations
based on the beautiful drawings
by Botticelli and for the philosophical
commentary of Cristoforo Landino. As
a substitute for the very first printed
edition, published at Foligno in 1472,
it has the handsome facsimile pub-
lished in 1911; it has also a copy of
the first Aldine edition, Venice, 1502,
and of the counterfeit Aldine published
at Lyons in the same year. In all of
these early editions, Dante’s famous
poem is named simply Le terza rime
di Dante. The first use of the term
divine came in the title of the first col-
lected edition (though actually in-
complete), Opere del divino poeta
Danthe, Venice, 1512; later, by general
acclamation, the title Divina Comme-
dia was given to the poem.
The Zahm Dante Library has no
holdings of the manuscripts of the
Divine Comedy, of which the surpris-
ing number of about 600 are known to
exist. The most important manuscripts
are in the Vatican and Florentine libra-
ries. There is no known manuscript
from Dante’s own hand, unless possibly
the marginal notes in a manuscript
in the Vatican Library of the poems of
Amaut Daniel, the Provencal poet to
whom Dante refers fondly in the Pur ga-
tor io, are in his handwriting. Some
of the codices of the Divine Comedy
have been published, usually in hand-
some facsimile, and these are available
in the Zahm Library.
The grandeur, scope and profundity
of Dante’s work were recognized very
early. Commentaries and elaborate
exegeses appeared soon after his death
in 1321, and translations began to
appear in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. Among the very early form-
al commentators were Dante’s own sons
Jacopo and Pietro, working independ-
ently of each other; Dante’s great
admirer and a great writer in his own
right, Giovanni Boccaccio, who wrote
also the first Life of Dante; Graziolo
de’ Bambaglioli, the Chancellor of Bo-
logna, and Jacopo dello Lana, professor
of the University of Bologna. All of
these commentators (and others) wrote
within a generation after the death of
Dante.
The great surge, however, after the
Renaissance and the Reformation,
when Dante’s prestige had declined and
his work was only poorly understood,
came with the Romantic Movement, in
Germany, France and England, and
with the Risorgimento in nineteenth
century Italy. From that time to this,
hundreds of editions and commentaries,
translations, biographies, and learned
specialized studies have appeared, in
nearly all the languages of the civilized
world. Most of these works, if not
quite all, are available in the Zahm
Library. Some great controversies in
the scholarly world have been waged
about Dante’s work (the De Mon-
archia, for example., was listed in the
Index Librorum Prohibitorum for
many years, for political reasons) and
more than a few moot questions and
unsolved problems still remain. Some
of the translations are startling, in the
very fact of their having been made,
because good translation at best is very
difficult and usually an unrewarded
labor of love. For example, there is a
translation into Japanese, but of the
Inferno only, published in Tokyo in
1914. The title of the book, on the
last page instead of the first, since the
pagination is, to us, in reverse, would
read something like this, literally trans-
lated: “a godlike poetic composition
about the underground jail!” There
are translations into Hebrew, Arabic,
modem Greek, Finnish, Croatian.
Strangest of all, perhaps, a translation
of the Paradiso into Russian was pub-
lished in 1945 in Moscow.
But these are only curiosities. The
Zahm Dante Library is a superb work-
shop for the scholar and an inspira-
tion, if rather ah awesome one, for the
serious student. AH' of the important
editions in Italian, past and present, of
all of Dante’s works, are there, and the
English translations, from the early ones
by Cary and Longfellow and Charles
Eliot Norton to the most recent ones
by Binyon and Sayres and Bickersteth
and Ciardi; and all the accumulated
scholarship of generations of critics and
experts, on the work which has been
described as one of the supreme
achievements of the human mind. The
bound volumes of the learned journals
are at hand: the Giornale Dantesco,
the Societa Dantesca Italiana Bullet-
tino, the Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch
and Studi Danteschi—both of which
have resumed publication after a lapse
during the war—and the Proceedings
and Papers of the Dante Society of
America. And there are dictionaries,
biographical and linguistic, concord-
ances, and other works of reference.
One of the most valuable modem
editions for the scholar is that of Guido
Biagi and his collaborators: La Divina
Commedia nella figurazione artistica
e nel secolare commento. This was an
enterprise begun in 1921 in honor of
the sexcentenary of Dante’s death and
finished in 1939. In three handsome
folio volumes bound in morocco, this
is a variorum edition, based for the
text on a careful study of the extant
manuscripts and including the most
The “Divine Comedy” is required reading
in the College of Arts and Letters.
important passages from the best com-
mentaries from the fourteenth to the
eighteenth centuries. This compen-
dium of commentary is so extensive
that on each folio page a few lines of
the poem, two or three stanzas at most
of three lines each, are surrounded by
two columns of explication. A copy
of the Paradiso volume is shown in the
illustration above.
The most luxurious (and expensive)
edition is “elephant” folio in size
(about two and a half by three feet),
in three volumes bound respectively in
three shades of morocco (for Heaven,
Purgatory, and Hell) over boards
bolted with bronze bolts, and illustrated
in one hundred full-page colored re-
productions of paintings 1 by Amos
Natini. The open volume of the In-
ferno is shown in the illustration on
page 3. This was also a project for
the sexcentenary, but was not finished
until several years later. The text is
printed by engravure in gold on especi-
ally made paper. The illustrations, one
for each of the hundred • cantos of the
Divine Comedy, are very colorful and
naturalistic in detail. The principal
interest of this edition however, is that
of an extremely lavish (and somewhat
gaudily expensive) work of book-
making.
Father Zahm’s original collection
came to the University Library after
his death in 1921. It was carefully
catalogued under the direction of Mr.
Paul Byrne, and then housed in a large
attractive room of its own, with an
especially decorated ceiling using the
Florentine lily as its motif. The cases
are surmounted by various busts and
sculptures of Dante, and the walls
lined with various reproductions and
photographs of paintings and subjects
relevant to the general theme, all of
them collected by Father Zahm. These
accoutrements are now in need of re-
furbishing and further development.
The growth of the Zahm Dante Library
has been made possible by use of the
income from a small fund of money
originally derived from the royalties on
Father Zahm’s books, at his request and
so designated by the University. But
this has not been entirely sufficient to
fill the gaps of the original collection
and at the same time to acquire new
works as they are published anywhere
in the world.
There has been a continuous tra-
dition of courses in Dante at Notre
Dame through several generations:
from Father Zahm to Father John W.
Cavanaugh (whose then famous course,
after his retirement from the presi-
dency, was given in the Dante Room
for about ten years); to Professor
Charles Phillips and Father Thomas
Brennan, down to the 40’s and 50’s,
when the present writer and more re-
cently Professor John Frederick Nims
have been giving such courses. In the
revised curriculum of the College of
o
Arts and Letters the Divine Comedy
is again being 'read and discussed by
students at Notre Dame, in a “great
books” course called the Junior Col-
legiate Seminar, required of all juniors
in the College. Thus the tradition,
though at times 'almost at the point of
vanishment, is being sustained and
nurtured. Certainly it is a defensible
thesis that every student of the humani-
ties, particularly in a. Catholic univer-
sity, should know the Divine Comedy.
Happily it is true again that no student
will graduate Bachelor of Arts from
Notre Dame without having read and
discussed the great Christian poem of
Dante Alighieri,
o
It is hoped that with this re-
suscitation a Dante professorship may
some day be established at Notre Dame.
Perhaps in the nearer and more practic-
able future, an annual Dante lecture-
ship may be founded, as a step toward
that goal.

During the present era, many state
supported institutions of higher learn-
ing are expanding their physical facil-
ities and increasing their teaching staffs
to meet the rising tide of enrollment.
In view of this situation we might con-
sider the reasons why there should be
a great Catholic university or any
Catholic university at all.
The only legitimate answer would
have to demonstrate that a Catholic
university has a function, as a university
and precisely as Catholic, fulfilled by
no other. This function would have to
meet a real and vital need in the world
today, a need being met by no other
agent. All other universities would suf-
fer by comparison to such a providen-
tial institution. This institution would
be proud of its place in the world,
would fulfill its mission with enthusi-
astic zeal and unrelenting effort.
Universities, like all other institutions,
came into being because men saw in
them an answer to an urgent human
need. Obviously, these needs vary
somewhat from age to age. This re-
sults in a varied emphasis on the part
of the university. This much though,
I think, should be stated as a matter
of stable principle regarding university
objectives irrespective of the actual cul-
tural, political, religious, or economic
climate of any age: The university is
by its essential nature committed to the
mission of learning and teaching. The
university is bom when human minds
are at work together for intellectual
purposes. The university prospers when
men are willing to stand firmly for the
value of things intellectual, to devote
themselves wholeheartedly to study and
learning and teaching that the human
intellect may “become richer and
stronger, broader in appreciation and
sympathy, more firm in judgment, more
sure in action ... to gain at least some
measure of wisdom, some vision of
truth, some understanding of the Will
of God.”
It was such a vision and such an
intellectual human need that first drew
men together in an association that be-
came a university at Paris, Bologna,
Chartres, Oxford and Cambridge. It
might be noted that all of these were
Catholic universities at one time, since
all their learning was ordered under
the egis of theology, the highest wis-
dom. They are not Catholic today
because much has happened since, reli-
giously, culturally, politically, and eco-
nomically, to further complicate this
essential intellectual task of the univer-
sity.
Notre Dame’s own history is a thrill-
ing account of sacrifice, devotion, and
sheer pioneering perservance that
brought this university from a strug-
gling grammar school to what it is
today. In this the 116th year of Notre
Dame history our immediate problems
are the present and the future. Ours
is a demanding spiritual task of the
highest order, in fullest accord with
the rich age-old tradition of Christian
wisdom. Ours is an apostolate that no
secular university today can undertake
—for they are largely cut-off from a
tradition of knowledge which comes
only through faith in the mind and
faith in God, the highest wisdom of
Christian philosophy and Catholic
theology. We must be conscious of our
past heritage, and enthusiastic in bring-
ing new insights of Christian wisdom
to the present. Here is a task for the
greatest minds, and the most devoted
hearts and completely dedicated lives.
I know of no other place on earth
where we might make a better begin-
ning than at Notre Dame, a new center
of Christian culture, an awakening of
the potential of Christian wisdom ap-
plied to the problems of our age. As
a Catholic university we must not fail
to exploit the full power of Christian
wisdom to order what is disordered, to
complete what is good but incomplete,
to meet insufficient knowledge with the
fullness of truth, to give a new direction
and a wider, saner perspective to all
that is good and true in our times.

‘Extra Points' to Enable You to Enjoy
Those Gridiron Spectaculars
By TERRY BRENNAN
The author was appointed head
coach of football at Notre Dame on
Feb. 1, 1954. He was an outstanding
athlete in high school and college, and
played halfback for the Fighting Irish
under Frank Leahy. Coach Brennan
graduated in 1949 with an A.B. degree
and majored in philosophy. While
coaching at Mt. Carmel High School,
Chicago, he attended night school at
DePaul University and received a law
degree in 1953. Terry is married to
the former Mary Louise Kelley of Mil-
waukee, and they are the parents of
one son and two daughters. This article
was prepared with the cooperation of
McNaught Syndicate.
Thousands of sports-minded Amer-
icans are ‘dyed-in-the-wool’ football
fans but most of them are not familiar
with the basic formations and styles of
of football’ but some of the following
paragraphs may be helpful for you to
enjoy the game this fall.
First of all, read the sports pages of
your newspaper to pick up all the in-
formation possible about the two teams
you’re going to watch on Saturday
afternoon. In that way you’ll know
what players to watch closely, the com-
parative size and speed of the teams,
their strongest offensive and defensive
maneuvers, and their style of play.
When a sports writer describes a
team as a “split-T” eleven or a “T”
or a “single-wing” or a “double-wing”
club, you shouldn’t have any difficulty
recognizing those offensive formations
as the team lines up to run a play be-
fore the snap of the ball.
The “T” formation presents a team
with a balanced line—a guard, tackle
and end on each side of the center.
The backfield lines up to resemble a
“T” with the quarterback directly be-
hind the center ready to take the ball
and the fullback perhaps five feet be-
hind the quarterback with the halfbacks
spaced on each side of the fullback.
In the “T” formation the quarter-
back handles the ball on every play
usually handing the ball off to one of
the other backs or passing. Linemen
are positioned close to each other, each
lineman blocking an opposing lineman
singly although they can double-team,
two offensive linemen on one defensive
man.
Occasionally you’ll see a man-in-
motion from the “T”—a back who runs
parallel with the line before the ball
is snapped. Deceptive ball handling is
a trademark of the “T” along with
quick thrusts into the line which makes
it difficult oftentimes to follow the back
with the ball.
The “split-T” is like the “T” in that
the line is balanced with a guard, tackle
and end on each side of the center with
the backfield positioned in the shape
of a “T”—the quarterback directly be-
hind the center. The difference be-
tween the “T” formation and the
“split-T,” and from this difference

Wing T
Single Wing
(UCLA)
Single Wing,
unbalanced line
comes the name, is a noticeable space
—or split—between the linemen.
In the “split-T” you’ll also notice
that the quarterback carries the ball
more often than his straight “T”
counterpart. After taking the snap
from center, the quarterback will move
parallel with the line and he can either
lateral to a back moving with and
slightly forward but still behind him
or he can run wide himself or cut
sharply into the line depending on
what the defense does.
Linemen in the “split-T” block one-
on-one and you will see tricky ball
handling with quick starting, fast-mov-
ing plays designed to prevent the de-
fense from slashing through the gaps
left on the line by the widely spaced
offensive linemen.
The split offensive line obviously
forces the defensive line to spread giv-
ing the defense a greater area to cover
and consequently presenting the offense
with more openings to run through.
The quarterback in this type of of-
fense is usually the passer but he must
be a good ball carrier and a quick
thinker to execute to best advantage
the optional plays in which he must
decide in a split second whether to
carry the ball himself or to hand off
or lateral to another back. There is
still another possible option play that
is an integral part of the “split-T.” The
halfback who takes a lateral from the
quarterback can either run or pass.
The “single-wing” and “double-
wing” formations as a rule employ an
unbalanced line with four linemen on
one side of the center and two on the
other. The backs may line up in a
“T” but then they will shift either
right or left with one back just outside
the end, another a couple of yards
behind the center, and the remaining
two lined up roughly in between. The
back who receives the pass from the
center is usually a triple-threat man
who can run, pass and kick.
In the “double-wing” backs are
lined up outside each end which gives
the system its name. Otherwise the
formation is like the “single-wing” with
an imbalanced line and triple-threat
tailback. The “double-wing” is also a
great passing formation because you
can send the two ends and two backs
downfield so quickly. Spread the
“double-wing” out a little and you
have a “spread” formation.
Both the “single” and “double-wing”
systems emphasize power with their
double-team blocking but more recently
the formations have utilized more de-
ception and trapping of opposing line-
men than the old style “single” and
“double-wing.” In both formations you
enjoy a great power threat to the
strong side of the line, the side pre-
senting four linemen against the oppo-
sition. This sets up weak side attacks
and a number of trap plays.
There are variations to all of the
systems but if you recognize the basic
formations and know why they are
being used and what they can do you
will recognize the changes. At Notre
Dame last fall, for example, we oc-
casionally used the “split-T,” our basic
formation, with an imbalanced line.
Each of the systems has advantages
the others cannot offer but one thing
o
is true of each. If you have proper
execution of plays, if each man does
his job, you can move the ball under
any system.
“Football Nomenclature”
MOUSE TRAP—permitting a de-
fensive lineman to charge through the
line unmolested, then hitting him
from broadside, thus opening up a
hole.
BOOTLEG PLAY—is characterized
by the entire backfield flowing, or
running to either the left or right
side. The quarterback will fake a
hand-off to one cf the halfbacks, then
will hide the ball against his hip, or
thigh. The quarterback then circles
to the opposite side of the backfield
flow and will either continue to rim
or stop to throw to the end.
STATUE OF LIBERTY—the play
whereby a back will appear to pass,
but will hold his position until an-
other back, or end rims from the op-
posite side and grabs the ball from
the posed passer-to-be.
BELLY SERIES—also called the
“ride series.” The quarterback will
seemingly place the ball in the “mid-
section” of another hack, “riding” a
short distance with him, while main-
taining possession of the ball, then
either completing the handoff or
keeping the ball.
PITCH OUT—the lateral pass made
behind the line of scrimmage to a
back who will try to run to the
outside.
FLANKER—any offensive back usu-
ally set into position outside of his
own end.
WEAK SIDE PLAY—a play geared
to the side of the center on which
there are fewer offensive linemen
aligned.
FAKING—a deceptive maneuver in
which a player will seemingly do one
thing and suddenly do another. The
object of faking is to deceive op-"
posing players causing them to com-
mit themselves in a defensive manner.
DOUBLE TEAM BLOCK — two
players “double” up on an opposing
player in order to take him com-
pletely out of the sphere or area of
attack.
OPTIONAL PLAY—a play in which
the ball carrier has the choice of
running with the ball or passing it.

tional Relations.
Notre Dame’s Committee on Inter-
national Relations was established in
1948 under the leadership of the late
Dr. Waldemar Gurian. Since then it
has published twelve books and spon-
sored a number of campus symposia.
These symposia, which have drawn to-
gether noted foreign affairs specialists
from western Europe as well as this
country, have dealt with problems aris-
ing from the “cold war” and the ethical
and religious as well as political aspects
of our relations with foreign powers.
The research of The Committee on
International Relations is supported in
part by a $100,000 grant received from
the Rockefeller Foundation in 1955.
Dr. Stephen Kertesz succeeded Dr.
Gurian as head of the committee. He
is former Hungarian minister to Italy
Other Committee members are M. A.
Fitzsimons, editor of Notre Dame’s
Review of Politics and professor of
history at the University; F. A. Her-
mens, professor of political science;
John J. Kennedy, associate professor
of political science; and W. O. Shana-
han, professor of history.
Seven specialists in various aspects of
American life spoke at the symposium
whose object was “a clear presentation
of American ideas, institutions, goals
and practices,” according to Prof.
Kertesz. Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh,
G.S.C., Notre Dame president, served
as chairman of the sessions which were
held in the Law Auditorium on
campus.
Visiting speakers and their subjects
included Prof. Jerome G. Kerwin,
University of Chicago, “The Living
Constitution”; Prof. Louis Brownlow,
Washington University of St. Louis,
“The American City”; Don K. Price,
vice president of The Ford Foundation,
New York, N. Y., “Government and
Science”; and George N. Shuster, presi-
dent of Hunter College, New York,
New York, “The Meaning of Higher
Education in the United States.”
Three Notre Dame faculty members,
in addition to Dr. Kertesz, also spoke
at the symposium. They are John T
Frederick, “The Meaning of Literature
in America Today”; Aaron I. Abell,
“The Religious Factor”; and Matthew
A. Fitzsimons, “American Culture:
Universal Elements and Specific Fea-
tures.”
Distinguishing between European
and American colleges, Dr. Shuster said
the institutions differ principally in
three characteristics. In Europe the
selection of students for higher educa-
tion is rigorous and personal with the
instructor, while here it is based on
authority as expressed in entrance
exams. In Europe the lecturer presents
the material and the students absorb
it, but here the teacher and student
cooperate in discovering material
through discussion. And in Europe
there is a unity of culture, but here
the cultures vary widely from one
school to another.
“By our system of educating almost
anyone who comes to the University,
we pour into the nation innumerable
riches which are squandered by other
nations which categorically chop off
all but the finest students,” Dr. Shuster
said. But this raises problems, he added.
American colleges have neither the
room nor the teachers to handle the
great flood of students who will apply
for entrance in a few years. To insure
that our finest young minds are edu-
cated as they should be, the New York
educator said, we must adopt a new
system of selection which will come into
operation in the early grades of high
school, channeling some students into
academic programs and others into
“terminal high school courses.”
Prof. John T. Frederick of the Notre
Dame English Department said that
American literature of the past cen-
tury has been characterized by a moral
earnestness and a “particulamess or
vital contact with the texture of Amer-
ican life.”
“These two principles have been
stated critically and realized creatively
during the past century in the nation’s
letters,” Frederick stated, and he traced
the characteristics in the work of vir-
tually every major writer in the period.
Speaking on “Government and
Science,” Don K. Price, of New York,
a member of the Ford Foundation staff,
is and had been on the rise for the
past century, there is little danger of a
scientific plutocracy in this country. He
explained that while problems of policy
at the bottom of the scale can be an-
swered with scientific formulas by ex-
perts trained in various fields, the ulti-
mate course of action taken by any
political unit must depend on a philo-
sophical and moral decision made at
the top of pyramid.
Price pointed out that Congress in-
creasingly turns to experts in the gov-
ernment for answers to problems which
their party platforms used to supply.
In a way, Price maintained, the ex-
perts in the government bureaus pre-

sent the policies and let the parties fight
over them.
In another area of science, the gov-
ernment can exert great leverage on
industry through the money spent on
research. Half of all the money spent
in this nation on aircraft and electronic
research comes from federal funds, he
said. The government expenditures for
research have soared from 10 million
dollars in 1900 to 21/2 billions in 1957,
he added.
The genius of the U. S. Constitu-
tion is its “flexibility,” Dr. Jerome G.
Kerwin, professor of political science
at the University of Chicago, told those
attending the symposium.
“The problems raised by mass edu-
cation, urbanism, science, automation
and world-wide stability seem stagger-
ing,” Professor Kerwin observed. “As
the Constitution has stood the rapid
changes of the past, I feel sure that
it will be wisely adapted to fit the
changes of the future,” he said.
“If the ability to apply wisely the
written word to changing circumstances
is lacking in a state, no written con-
stitution can last through the storms
that periodically break in the affairs
of men and nations,” Professor Kerwin
asserted. After 168 years, he pointed
out; the Constitution of the United
States “stands as the oldest of written
documents governing the destiny of a
free people. From a hodge-podge of
ill-asserted resolutions, cleverly but not
logically pieced together, it has become
a living symbol of a free government,”
he said.
The trend toward greater central
governmental control “has been a
world-wide phenomenon for the past
seventy-five years in all countries,”
Professor Kerwin noted. Nevertheless,
he pointed out, “in this country more
local self-government remains — dy-
namic and effective — than in any
other civilized power on the face of

the globe.” Some might marvel, he
said, “not at the extent of federal
power but at the restrictions still im-
posed, respected and observed.”
“America cannot content itself with
preaching universalism while we are
preoccupied with domestic affairs,”
Fitzsimons explained to the audience.
“Human dignity and freedom are in-
separable, and in affirming them we
directly meet their difficult conse-
quences. These are that we cannot
manufacture a simple global faith to

soberly remind the restless people of the
world that ultimately each nation
makes itself to its own flourishing oi'
o
undoing,” he declared.
Pointing out that America’s civiliza-
ticn is characterized by diversity and
variety, Fitzsimons said that “from
the foundation there was pluralism
rather than unity.”
Prof. Louis Brownlow,
Washington University of
St. Louis.
g on “The Religious Fac-
tor,” Aaron I. Abell, also of the Notre
Dame faculty, dwelt on diversity in
American culture in its religious aspects.
The presence of many religions in this
country led to the inclusion of religious
freedom guarantees in the Constitution,
he said, and he emphasized the con-
tinuing contribution of the churches
to education on all levels, to American-
ization and understanding among the
diverse racial and immigrant strains in
the population, and to social service
and social reform.
According to Professor Kertesz, the
symposium “unfolded the picture of
how the dynamic American system of
government has made possible a pro-
found revolution without upheavals
and how traditional American con-
cepts and values have been applied
to the rapidly changing conditions of
modem life.” The various speakers,
he said, endeavored to make a “critical
appraisal and sincere evaluation” of
our country whose “intellectual strength,
determination and courage” greatly in-
fluence the direction of world events
today.

Expedition
(Ed. Note: The foregoing account
vividly describes the landing of the first
plane at the South Pole. A prominent
Notre Dame alumnus, Captain William
M. Hawkes, USN, '33, served as co-
pilot of the seven-man expedition. The
only other explorers who had previ-
ously journeyed to the Pole were the
British who arrived there on foot in
1912. Scientific discoveries at the Ant-
arctic during the International Geo-
physical Year may prove of inestimable
value affecting the lives of people all
over the world. The American group
braved frigid blasts of 58-below-zero
when the R4D Douglas Skytrain landed
on this frozen Sahara. Captain Hawkes'
article has been officially approved by
the United States Navy. John Cackley.)
My association with the Antarctic
began in 1939 when Lt. George Dufek
(now Rear Admiral Dufek) sailed
South with the U. S. Antarctic Service
Expedition as navigator of the BEAR.
He and I were, up to that time, flying
mates in Scouting Three, a dive-bomber
squadron of what was then called the
Battle Force, Pacific Fleet.
We met occasionally during World
War II and were reunited in 1946
when we both went South; he as com-
mander of the seaplane group which
engaged in the mapping of the Ant-
arctic coastline, and I as head of the
long-range exploratory ski-planes which
were employed in photographic map-
ping of as much of the interior of the
continent as could be reached from our
base at Little America. My passenger
for much of the expedition was Rear
Admiral R. E. Byrd and my co-pilot
was Lt. Conrad Shinn, about whom
more later.
In 1949 the Navy was again called
upon to continue its exploration in the
South and we were just about ready
to sail when the powers-that-be had
a change of heart and the program
was cancelled.
In 1954, with the advent of the In-
ternational Geophysical Year, Opera-
tion Deep Freeze was established and
the routine again started but this time
on an elaborate scale; larger and better
aircraft, many bases, scientists by the
dozens, etc. I was safely ensconced
behind a desk when the phone rang
and once more I was on my way, to
Rear Admiral Dufek’s
Aviation Officer.
By October 1955 all was ready avia-
tion-wise and we flew to New Zealand
and then to McMurdo Sound, a spot
in the Antarctic about 2300 miles from
New Zealand. The ships followed and
set up camps on the fringe of the con-
tinent, a prerequisite to the scientific
bases to be established later in the
interior.
From the cockpit of a Navy patrol
bomber I had the good fortune to drop
a Notre Dame pennant on the Pole as
I passed by on the first flight ever to
span the continent—from the Pacific to
the Weddell Sea and return, about
3500 miles. The primary mission of

passengers its interior was completely
occupied with survival equipment and
auxiliary fuel. As pilot I had selected
Lieutenant Commander Shinn, my co-
pilot from the 1947 expedition. I went
along as copilot, Rear Admiral Dufek
as passenger.
Weather conditions were forecast to
be excellent, and the 24 hours of con-
tinuous daylight was a particular bless-
ing. For the first 400 miles we flew
at low altitude, unwilling to sacrifice
the fuel required by an early climb in
our greatly overloaded condition. Our
aircraft skis slowed our cruising to 98
knots, barely above stalling speed.
Four hours after take-off we reached
the foot of the Beardmore Glacier, a
gigantic river of ice a hundred miles
supply. It was latex- a source of satis-
faction to observe the C-124 flying lazy
circles dead ahead, with the Pole di-
rectly beneath.
As a prelude to landing we had to
determine the wind direction, flying tri-
angular patterns at decreasing altitude.
While so engaged we became distress-
ingly aware that it was cooling off out-
side, the temperature dropping with
every foot of altitude and already at
—40°F.
I lowered the landing gear and
watched the skis drop into position. All
looked well but a red warning light
blinked on, indicating an unsafe ski
condition. Hoping that it was due
merely to a frozen switch we squared
away on final approach. Large clods
the aircraft was to determine whether
bases could be erected at the areas
selected and requisite personnel and
equipment flown in by the ski-planes.
I therefore visited all the projected sites
and had a good look at plenty of frozen
real estate on the way. The oncoming
Winter night forced the ships and air-
craft to withdraw early in 1956 and
we left behind about 160 men to keep
things going until we returned.
So, the following October, back we
came and the question which loomed
largest was whether we’d be successful
in our first attempted landing at the
South Pole where we intended to erect
a scientific base. While professing its
ease to one another those of us who
were to be directly engaged all felt
some private doubt. In an attempt to
reassure myself I flew very low over
the Pole on three occasions and I
wasn’t reassured at all. The surface
looked hard and rough—waves of snow
10 to 30 inches high, swells measured
in feet—a snowy waste frozen into the
immobility characteristic of the Ant-
arctic, aggravated by its 2-mile height
and —50° temperature. But, no matter
how often I looked, it surely wouldn’t
get any lower or much warmer and
meanwhile time was wasting.
On 31 October 1956, New Zealand
date, we made our first and fortunately
successful attempt. The aircraft we em-
ployed was a specially-equipped Navy
RAD similar in external configuration
to the conventional twin-engine trans-
ports used by many airlines. With the
exception of accommodations for two

from the Antarctic Plateau.
Being lighter by 3000 pounds due
to expended fuel we labored to the
10,000 foot altitude required to sur-
mount the glacier and finally reached
the plateau. The Pole itself lay 300
miles due South.
At that time we were passed by an
Air Force C-124 Globemaster, assigned
to drop to us the tents, food, sledges
and other items needed for survival in

control surfaces with a nerve-wracking
thump. Not exactly a heartening pic-

Finally, we touched down. Not
gently, but down. The plane slithered
to a rough stop in a few hundred feet
on a surface akin to a frozen ocean—
closely packed waves of icy snow, flint-
hard and 20 inches high, remnants of
past storms, interspersed with patches
of new fallen snow granular as sand

sumption upward at the present rate,
then fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and
natural gas will be virtually depleted in
the foreseeable future. Right now, fossil
fuels account for about 80% of the
world’s total power reserve. The prob-
lem boils down to this: If we don’t
develop a suitable substitute for fossil
fuels as a power source and do it soon,
we’re going to be faced with a serious
power shortage as early as the year
2,000.
At present, the atom seems to pro-
vide the most workable solution to the
energy problem. The nine-member
McKinney Panel on Peaceful Uses of
Atomic Energy, whose work was author-
ized and financed by Congress, was
concerned with the prospects of energy
shortage, and more immediately with
the dearth of competent nuclear engi-
neers and scientists in our country. It
is primarily the responsibility of higher
education to alleviate this manpower
shortage. The committee’s recommen-
dations emphasized that there is no
single master plan for colleges and
universities to follow. It advocated sev-
eral alternative plans, specifically rec-
ommending, among other things, an
increase in the number of nuclear
reactors to be made available to
universities.
A nuclear reactor is a device in
which fissionable material can be split.

Undergraduates in the College of Engineering
Notre Dame students in the College
of Engineering are learning the applica-
tion of nuclear fission to industrial uses
in a new series of courses which has
already enrolled a number of under-
graduates in it.
To retain its stature as a great mod-
em university, Notre Dame must rec-
ognize and satisfy the needs of con-
temporary society. In a few short years
the use for atomic power, until re-
cently thought to be only military, will
become more far-reaching than that.
The United Nations Conference on
Atomic Energy, held at Geneva in the
summer of 1955, emphasized the amaz-
ing increase in energy consumption that
has accompanied industrialization. In
1950, the world was taxing its power
sources at ten times the rate of a cen-
tury before. If the demands of modem
living continue to push the power con-
Three Grants Totaling $40,000
Three grants totaling more than
$40,000 have recently been awarded
by the National Science Foundation
and the Atomic Energy Commission
to Notre Dame’s Department of
Mechanical Engineering.
Dr. M. K. Newman has received
a grant of $14,900 from the National
Science Foundation to conduct a
two-year research program on
“Thermo-Elastic Damping in Im-
pact Vibrations of Beams.”
A second National Science Foun-
dation grant of $12,800 will be used
by Dr. Kwang Tzu-Yang, assistant
professor of mechanical engineering,
for a “Study on Unsteady La-
minar Boundary Layers with Heat
Transfer.”

grant of $13,400 is being used to

is controlled in the reactor to bring
o
about a chain reaction in many atoms,
producing atomic energy. This energy
can then be utilized to generate power.
The inevitable development of nu-
clear energy for peaceful uses and the
need for trained nuclear engineers was
recognized by Dr. Karl E. Schoenherr,
Dean of the College of Engineering,
soon after World War II. About 1948
plans were formulated under Iris lead-
ership for the development of a nuclear
engineering program at Notre Dame.
At first, there was some uncertainty
whether the development of this pro-
gram should be entrusted to the Chem-
ical or the Mechanical Engineering
o	o
Department. This -uncertainty resolved
itself when it became apparent that the
near-future application of nuclear
energy was in the field of power pro-
duction—the traditional field of the
mechanical engineer. Thereafter, the
Dean assigned the program to Dr.
Marcel Newman who had joined the
faculty in 1950, and had the requisite
theoretical background in nuclear
physics.
Dr. Newman received his basic engi-
neering background at the Polytechni-
cal Institute of Hannover, Germany
and the University of Kentucky, earned
his Master’s degree at Pittsburgh, and
holds a doctorate from Columbia.
Notre Dame’s nuclear engineering
program is a fundamental one con-
cerned with the application of princi-
ples of chemistry, nuclear physics, and
modem physics to problems of nuclear
engineering, radiation shielding, metal-
lurgical requirements, and other related
subjects. An elective course in nuclear
engineering was first offered in 1954.
Based on principles of nuclear physics,
the course stressed reactor theory. This
year the curriculum was expanded into
a full program, giving the mechanical
and other engineering students the op-
portunity to take a Nuclear Power
Option beginning in the second semester
of the junior year. The option has a
total of 18 credit hours in chemical
physics, nuclear physics, and nuclear
engineering.
The present program is therefore
for undergraduates and its purpose is
educational. Eventually it may be ex-
panded into a graduate program with
research. There are several reasons for
not entering into graduate work im-
mediately, as explained by the Dean.
First, the dire need at present is for
trained engineers and not for more re-
search, since the large government re-
search laboratories such as the Argonne,
Oak Ridge and Brookhaven, are fully
able to handle all research problems.
This is well illustrated by the fact that
the Atomic Energy Commission last
year announced a program by which
grants of up to $350,000 may be made
to a school for instructional purposes
in Nuclear Engineering, but not a
penny for research. Secondly, graduate
studies require extensive and very ex-
pensive preparation, while an under-
graduate program can be developed at
relatively small expense. Finally, it is
quite difficult to attract graduate stu-
dents to a school, even after a program
has been developed, while it is relatively
easy to “sell” it to undergraduates now
on campus.
This brings up the question whether
or not the University should install a
reactor. As long as the program re-
mains mainly educational a large ex-
pensive reactor is not necessary. Many
of the most instructive experiments,
can be performed equally well or even
better on a small power reactor or a.
sub-critical assembly as on a large-
reactor. On the other hand, should
the program be eventually expanded
into research graduate studies, then the-

Six Supreme Court Justices
at Notre Dame
In what may be a precedent-shatter-
ing record, distinguished jurists partici-

and other programs at Notre Dame
include six members of the United
States Supreme Court. All but Jus-
tice Brennan have appeared on campus
in recent months while he will be one
of the judges in the October Moot
Court trials.
Chief Justice Earl Warren was the
principal speaker at this year’s Com-
mencement exercises when more than

brilliant career in public office. The
Chief Justice received his legal train-
ing at the University of California
where he was awarded a Bachelor of
Laws degree in 1912 and a J.D. degree
two years later. Many universities and
colleges have conferred honorary
doctorates upon him including the Uni-
versity of Redlands, College of Pacific,
University of Southern California,
Santa Clara, University of Alaska and
Notre Dame.
A native Californian, the Chief Jus-
tice served his state as governor from
1943 to 1953. He had also been
attorney general, temporary chairman
and keynote speaker of the 1944 Re-
publican National Convention, and
Republican nominee for vice-president
of the U.S. in 1948. President Eisen-
hower named Chief Justice Warren as
this country’s Special Ambassador to
the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in
1953. For the past four years he has
been Chancellor of the Board of Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution
and Chairman of the National Art
Gallery’s Board of Trustees.
Chief Justice Warren has received
decorations from many foreign na-
tions including the Luxembourg Crown
of Oak, British Coronation Medal and
Italian Star of Solidarity.
Honorable Stanley F. Reed, retired
associate justice of the Supreme Court,
was the principal speaker at the Law
School’s fourth

versity. He studied law at the Univer-
sity of Virginia and Columbia Univer-
sity. Justice Reed has been the re-
cipient of honorary degrees from Ken-
tucky, Columbia, Yale and the Univer-
sity of Louisville. This distinguished
jurist was admitted to the Kentucky
Bar in 1910 and had an outstanding
career in private practice as well as in
government. At various periods he
served in the following capacities:
general counsel of the Federal Farm
Board; general counsel of the R.F.C.;
special assistant to the Attorney Gen-
eral; solicitor general of the United
States; member of the Kentucky legis-
lature; and chairman of the President’s
Committee on Civil Service Improve-
ment. He is a veteran of World War
I, having been commissioned a First
Lieutenant in the U.S. Army.
Justice Reed was appointed to the
nation’s highest tribunal by President
Roosevelt in 1938. He retired from
the Court this past February after 19
years as associate justice. Chief Justice
Warren recently cited him as “a man
who served the Court and served the
nation to a remarkable degree.”
o
Associate Justice Tom C. Clark pre-
sided at Notre Dame’s sixth annual
Moot Court Competition along with
two other dis-
tinguished ju-
rists, Judge
Potter Stewart
and Judge W.
Lynn Parkin-
son. Bom in
Dallas, Justice
Clark attended
school at Vir-
ginia Military
Institute and received a bachelor of
laws degree from the University of
Texas in 1922. He also has been
awarded honorary degrees from Beth-
any College, Centre College, Missouri
Valley College and Texas Tech. Dur-
ing World War I, he was a member
of the 153rd Infantry.
After five years of law practice,
Justice Clark became Civil District
Attorney for Dallas County, and was
associated with a Dallas law firm for
two years. In 1937 he joined the De-
partment of Justice as an attorney and
President Truman named him Attor-
ney General in 1945. As Attorney Gen-
eral he was recognized for his fight for
civil rights and better citizenship, his
support of public education against
crime and his aggressive attack on
communist infiltration.
Mr. Justice Clark is the first Texan
to be appointed to the Supreme Court,
succeeding Mr. Justice Murphy in
1949. He has helped to awaken the
nation to the necessity of expanding
juvenile opportunity.
Associate Justice John Marshall Har-
lan assisted in judging Moot Court
competition at Notre Dame during the
1956-57 school
year. Bom in
Chicago, he at-
tended Prince-
ton University
and received
a Bachelor of
Arts degree
from that in-
stitution in
1920. During
o
John M. Harlan
the next few years Justice Harlan was
a Rhodes Scholar and was awarded
several degrees from Oxford University
in England. He took his legal training
at New York Law School and is the
recipient of a Bachelor of Laws degree.
Justice Harlan was appointed to the
Supreme Court in 1955 following an
outstanding career in private practice
and in government posts. He has been
chief counsel of the New York State
Crime Commission, assistant U.S. at-
torney general of the Southern District
of New York, special assistant to the
attorney general of New York State,
and also judge of the U. S. Court of
Appeals. As a colonel in the U.S. Air
Force in World War II, Justice Harlan
was decorated by this country with the
Legion of Merit and was presented the
Croix de Guerre from both France and
Belgium.
Notre Dame’s Moot Court contest-
ants have appeared in the National
Moot Court Finals three times, in
16
Notre Dame
1950, 1951 and last year. It is an
extremely beneficial courtroom pro-
cedure in preparing students for the
practice of law.
Associate Justice Charles E. Whit-
aker assisted, along with Justice
Harlan, in judging the Moot Court
competition at .
Notre Dame
last Fall. He
was bom on a
farm in north-
eastern Kansas
and received
his early edu-
cation in a
one-room, one- Charles E Whitaker
teacher school-
house. Later he attended Kansas City
Law School, graduating in 1924. Just-
ice Whitaker practiced law in Kansas
City and concentrated on corporation
cases. In 1953 he was elected president
of the Missouri Bar Association. Presi-
dent Eisenhower appointed him to the
United States District Court for the
Western District of Missouri in 1954
and two years later to the U.S. Court
of Appeals. His clearly stated opinions
soon won favorable attention through-
out the Justice Department and he was
named to the U.S. Supreme Court this
year.
Married and the father of three sons,
Justice Whitaker, a Methodist, has sent
his boys to Rockhurst High School, a
Jesuit institution in Kansas City. He
owns a 160-acre beef cattle farm twenty
miles north of K-C.
While still a practicing lawyer, Judge
Whitaker made a concise statement of
the legal profession as follows, “Justice
cannot be produced through any sys-
tem of procedures alone. In the main
it is, and must always be, the product
of long hours of hard, diligent, pains-
taking labor by highly competent, ex-
perienced, careful and practical law-
yers.”
Associate Justice William Joseph
Brennan, Jr., will be one of the judges
in October of Notre Dame’s Moot
William J. Brennan, Jr.
Court trials.
Justice Bren-
nan ? r a d u-
o
ated from the
Business School
of Wharton at
the University
of P e n n s y 1-
in 1928. He
was recipient
of a bachelor
of laws degree at Harvard three years
later. Justice Brennan was admitted
to the New Jersey Bar in 1932 and
practiced law for 10 years with the
law firm of Pitney, Hardin and Skin-
ner. During World War II he served
with the Armed Forces as a specialist
in manpower and personnel work and
was discharged with the rank of
colonel. In 1949 he ascended the
bench as a trial judge in the New Jer-
sey Superior Court. Two years later
he was elevated to a judgeship in the
Appellate Division of the same court
and in 1952 Governor Driscoll appoint-
ed him an Associate Justice of the New
Jersey Supreme Court.
While serving on this court he was
given national recognition for his role
in the nation-wide drive to clarify court
congestion and delays in litigation.
President Eisenhower appointed him
an Associate Justice of the United
States Supreme Court on October 15,
1956. He is a trustee of the Newark
College of Engineering, a member of
the American Bar Association and the
New Jersey Bar Association and main-
tains his residence in Rumson, New
Jersey. Married to the former Miss
Marjorie Leonard, they are the parents
of two sons and a daughter.

American to set foot at the South Pole
and the first human to visit the site
since 1912 when Captain Robert Fal-
con Scott of the Royal Navy and his
companions departed, only to perish on
their return journey to McMurdo
Sound. Lieutenant Commander Shinn
did his best to keep the engines going,
and the plane mechanic made emerg-
ency repairs to the oil system. I busied
myself outside attempting to free the
skis, setting up radar reflectors to guide
those who were to come later, and per-
forming other necessary chores. Need-
less to say the biting wind and low
temperature gave added zest to our
movements.
Conditions portended a difficult if
not hazardous take-off. Our primary
concern was that our aircraft skis might
be firmly welded to the surface, much
as an ice-cube tray in a refrigerator.
We had developed a number of meth-
ods to free the skis in such event and
our main hope was that they would
work.
About three-quarters of an hour after
landing we re-embarked for the return
o
flight to base. Throttles were advanced

to full power but to no avail. There
we sat. Anticipating a need for their
use we had equipped the aircraft with
15 jet assist bomb-shaped metal con-
tainers (JATOS), each capable of
furnishing 1000 pounds of thrust for
15 seconds, by which time we should
have become airborne. So we fired four
JATOS but without effect. An addi-
tional four and the plane moved slug-
gishly. Then the last seven and we
gained enough speed to become air-
borne. The starboard engine gave some
concern as its oil pressure momentarily
failed but its power output was not
diminished and as the pressure returned
to normal my heart left my throat and
resumed its normal position.
The rest was without incident. We
landed at a cache, thoughtfully pro-
vided at sea level at a point 500 miles
from base, and picked up enough fuel
to return to McMurdo, where we
landed at 4:15 a.m., a tired lot.

purchase of a relatively large power

In line with this reasoning, present
plans are to supplement classroom in-
struction by laboratory work on instru-
mentation and on a sub-critical as-
sembly. Fortunately space for a nu-
clear engineering laboratory was avail-
able in the Heat-Power Laboratory
designed by the former head of the
Mechanical Engineering Department,
Carl C. Wilcox, and erected in 1940.
Instrumentation such as Geiger count-
ers, cathode ray oscillographs, ioniza-
tion chambers, binary scales, etc., is
now on order with a grant of $13,400
obtained from the Atomic Energy Com-
mission for this purpose. The Dean
explained that a proposal for an addi-
tional grant of $50,000 is now in pre-
paration to cover the cost of manu-
facture and erection of a sub-critical
assembly in the new laboratory.

SPONSORS OF “LIVING” CHAIRS
Notre Dame's Faculty Development Program was
initiated in 1953 when the nation's corporations were in-
vited to underwrite the expenditures for an additional
45 renowned professors to the teaching staff. That phase
of the plan has been most successful as evidenced by
the total of more than $2 million in contributions last
year from corporations and foundations. It remains an
integral part of the overall project and will continue to
be expanded as additional corporations indicate their
willingness to extend financial support.
The "Living" Chairs plan was developed in 1956
for the advancement of the teaching staff, based on
the correlation of student educational cost and its defi-
cit. It has long been recognized that the student only
pays about two-thirds of the cost required to educate
him. The difference is derived from endowment, auxili-
ary enterprises, and gifts from other sources such as
alumni, non-alumni and corporations. "Living" Chairs
have been established to subsidize faculty salaries by
permitting the donor to pay one-third of the amount
of the mean salary within the category selected. For
example, in the four levels of teaching at Notre Dame,
the following figures are evolved:
“Living” Chairs already sponsored by
generous gifts from corporations, indi-
viduals and alumni clubs are as follows:

$5 Million Faculty Fund
A munificent grant of $3,074,000 from the Ford Foundation combined with
a total of $1,400,000 contributed by alumni and corporations will form the nucleus
for the creation of a FIVE MILLION DOLLAR faculty development fund at
Notre Dame. This announcement was recently made by the Rev. Theodore M.
Hesburgh, C.S.C., president. Father Hesburgh indicated that he believed the
$600,000 balance needed to complete the fund will be donated in the near future
by alumni, non-alumni friends, corporations and foundations.
Notre Dame was in the top ten of universities and colleges receiving large
amounts for the Faculty Development Program from the Ford Foundation. It was
the largest single gift ever received by Notre Dame and also was the largest amount
given to any Catholic institution by the Foundation. The total of a half-billion dol-
lars to the nation’s accredited four-year colleges and universities and to privately
operated hospitals established an all-time record in philanthropy from any or-
ganization.
Income from the fund will be used by Notre Dame to increase professors’
salaries, to finance their advanced studies and to permit the publication of research
findings. Father Hesburgh stated that during the past three years, faculty salaries
have been revised upward and the payroll raised by approximately $750,000.
The final installment of $1,549,500 from the Ford Foundation was sent to
Notre Dame recently. The first portion of the grant was paid in 1956. Included
in the Ford gift was a $1,177,000 accomplishment grant, recognizing the Univer-
sity’s previous leadership in the furtherance of faculty salaries. Although this part
of the grant was unrestricted, it will be used to support the Faculty Development
Program.
Many distinguished teachers have been added to the Notre Dame staff since
the inception of faculty development four years ago. In 1956, 363 prominent cor-
porations and foundations were included among the list of contributors. It was es-
timated that $450,000 annually would be required to project this phase of the Fac-
ulty Development Program. About half of the anticipated forty-five internation-
ally-known teachers have been brought to the Notre Dame campus for lectures,
temporary appointments and as permanent members of the University staff.
