Dr. Coomes sealing experimental tube to vacuum

system.
by Robert Frolicher
Notre Dame's Research Labs Conducting Tests in
Radiation Detection of A-bomb Explosion
The year was 1942 and unknown
to the world at large a highly im-
portant and scientific race against
time was being enacted between
American and enemy scientists. The
scene in this country was taking
place at Radiation Laboratory, Cam-
bridge, Mass., where well-guarded
and secretive experiments were in
progress on the famous microwave
radar which later was to be used for
aircraft warning signals as well as
aiming systems for high-level bomb-
ing.
Among others in this outstanding
group of scientists we find Dr. Ed-
ward A. Coomes a professor of Phys-
ics at Notre Dame.
At the beginning of World War
II the enemy had planes that were
so fast, that radar of terrific power
had to be developed in order to see
the approaching targets in time to
shoot them down. This is where the
micro wave radar came in, for it act-
ually let one “see” objects in the
dark at distances of more than a
hundred miles—much greater than
any former device.
Because the previous tubes would
only last about as long as a lighted
match, research started in 1942 on
the new cathodes, some of which are
no bigger than the point of a sharp-
ened pencil, and became a “’must” for
the government. Approximately two
years of constant day-night effort
was spent on various experiments
which led up to its development. At
the outset, it appeared that the
United States was winning the race,
O	7
developing a radio transmitter tube
which could handle thousands of
times the power of those then in
existence.
Due to the secret nature of the de-
vices developed, the Office of Scien-
tific Research and Development de-
cided that the greater number of
research efforts concerned with elec-
tronics should be carried out at a
few large centers throughout the

country. Dr. Coomes was requested
to join the staff at Radiation Labor-
atory and head the primary work on
cathodes for radar tubes,

of the war.

awarded
the end
at Notre
Dame prior to his invitation to the
Radiation Laboratory. He received
his undergraduate training in the
o	o
Electrical Engineering Department at
Notre Dame, leading to his bachelor’s
degree in 1931, and in 1936 was
granted leave of absence for ad-
vanced studies at Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology.
Did you ever consider that every-
time we switch the radio on to our
favorite station, we are putting our
finger on the beginning of electronics
at Notre Dame? The research was
inaugurated by Professor Jerome
Green in 1899 with the experiments
on transmission of radio signals. Dr.
Coomes initiated the present research
activities after his return to the Notre
Dame teaching staff in 1938. Although
today television is just another mod-
ern invention, few people realize that
this was the time at which colored
movies, television, and flourescent
lighting were important problems in
research laboratories. Electronics re-

experience of the
developments, and
because the Notre Dame laboratory
is well equipped to carry out experi-
ments, this program has been backed
by the United States Navy since the
war. They have now furthered their
support to extend the program to the
development of the transistor. A
large portion of research workers in
electronics, both in universities and
in industrial laboratories are devot-
ing all of their time to the further-
ing of this project. The transistor,
a device very similar to our little
pencil point, has been the most im-
portant development in electronics
since the advent of the electron tube,
and is expected to replace most vac-
uum tubes when it reaches the final
stage.
The present research in electronics at
Notre Dame was started as a unit of
the graduate division of the Physics
Department. It is believed that such
specialization in physical electronics
affords the best medium to do im-
portant fundamental research and at
the same time supply expert training
for those graduate students of phys-
ics interested in furthering their as-
pirations toward a career in electron-
ics. The purpose of this branch of
physics is to deal with deadly atoms,
and to find its usefulness in con-
struction of everyday conveniences,
such as hearing aids, infra-red cook-
ing stoves and automatic garage
doors.
In the Nieuwland Science Hall
amid the mass of test tubes, wires
and bubbling chemicals, Dr. Coomes
can be found surrounded by a tech-
nical staff which, in proportion to
the number of personnel in the group,
is second to none in the country.
Under the sponsorship of the United
States Navy, the electronics group
at Notre Dame has developed a lab-
oratory which has complete modern
facilities for constructing vacuum
tubes, transistors, and similar elec-
tronic devices from raw materials.
It has modern vacuum ^.equipment
capable of exhausting to less than one
million millionth of the pressure of
the earth’s atmosphere. The lab is
equipped to study materials by means
of X-rays, photomicrograph, and
electron microscopy. It is equipped
completely for electrical testing.
After World War II, reorganiza-
tion of the staff at Notre Dame was
brought about by the return of Dr.
Coomes along with a small group of
people who worked with him during
the war. Rapid development of the
lab was made possible by the Navy
who furnished equipment that had
been built and used in wartime re-
search.
Dr. Coomes directs the work of
this group, and at the same time con-
tinues his research on thermionic
emission. These experiments require
advancements in both techniques and
theory. You will find in the elec-
tronics laboratory machinery for
building experimental vacuum tubes,
in which impurities can be controlled
to one atom in a million.
Dr. Coomes has only high praise
for his co-workers. While he direct-
ed the Physical Electronics Group at
Sylvania Electronics Products Com-
pany following the war, Dr. James
Buck, an associate, developed the
present pulse-testing laboratory, and
set up the equipment for taking elec-
trical measurements in intervals less
than a millionth of a second. In co-
operation with the National Bureau
of Standards, Father George Bald-
win, C.S.C., has set up a laboratory
for standardization of temperature
and light intensity which is required
for accurate electronics measure-
ments. Dr. David Juenker, who is
now on leave for post-doctorate work
at Princeton University, has started
a laboratory for photoelectric meas-
urements. The group has two tech-
nical assistants, Air. Ernest Parsons
and Air. Fay Gifford, both of whom
have been with the laboratory since
its reorganization seven years ago.
Both are experts at glassworking,
metal-working and other techniques
required in physical electronics re-
search.

Messrs. Gifford and
Parsons shaping bulb of experimental electronic tubes used for cathode research.

It was a quick summer. I had
looked forward to it; I had planned
to do so many things. The summer
is gone now and I look back to tell
you of some things that were done,
of a heartache or two, of some prog-
ress we made.
There is a note of sorrow as I
look back. Three of our boys died
since last I wrote to you. John Yan-
kiss, a junior in Liberal Arts, was
drowned. Joseph Conwell, a grad-
uate this year, died of sunstroke
while in officers’ training at Quanti-
co. James Morath, a graduate in
journalism this past August, was
killed in an automobile accident. All
of us at Notre Dame pray for the
repose of their souls. To the parents
and friends of these young men we
express our prayerful sympathy. In
life they walked the campus of Our
Lady; in death, She has taken them in
Her arms and led them to Her Son.
Commencement in June
In early June 914 seniors and 74
graduate students received degrees at
Notre Dame. It is always a thrill to
see so many fine young men finish
their years of study. We are proud
of each of them; our prayer is that
they will always keep us proud of
them as loyal sons of Notre Dame.
The middle of June was a time for
the 5-year reunions. The wear of the
years is evident as the men from ’48
back to ’03 came and laughed and
brought to life the past. It is good to
meet these. men who are always so
proud of their school. It’s good to
know that the teachings and examples
of our priests and faculty bring so
much happiness to so many lives.
Summer at Notre Dame seems to
be a time for Sisters, as 690 nuns
from many communities come to
school. They work hard, these daugh-
ters of the Lord, and are an inspira-
tion to all of us. At the end of the
summer session degrees were award-
ed to 178 students—42 of whom were
Sisters.
Father Walsh Receives Honorary
Degree
A word of congratulations to our
own Father Matthew Walsh. The
University of Notre Dame awarded
him an honorary degree, at the August
Commencement exercises, in recogni-
tion of his many years of devoted
service. Father Walsh, many of you
will recall, was President of Notre
Dame from 1922 to 1928.
Conventions at Notre Dame
Conventions are no small part of
summer days at Notre Dame. Each
convention takes great planning. My
gratitude to all who planned those
events. My congratulations to all who
participated. The Vocation Institute
was well-atended and should do much
toward the work of the Church. The
Institute of Spirituality had as its aim
to provide a firm theological founda-
tion for Sisters in their responsibili-
ties as superiors and counsellors.
The Christian Family Movement
is a movement we are all proud of.
The family is the heart of society and
of the Church. This wonderful coun-
try of ours will always be strong if
families are strong—for fatherland
always means mother country.
Space does not permit a discussion
on each convention that was held at
Notre Dame during the summer. We
at Notre Dame do hope that each per-
son who came to our campus will
come again. We do try to make all
feel at home.
It is time now for a word or two
on the present and future. We had a
quota to admit 1400 freshmen. We
exceeded this quota because we do not
like to turn away any young man who
is qualified to enter Notre Dame. We
must begin to plan on getting at least
two new freshman halls. There is
need, also for a dining hall on the east
campus. We want the men who come
to us out of high school to live on
campus and learn the life of a Notre
Dame man. I will tell you more about
our building plans in my next letter.
Football Games on Movie TV .
We are happy to be able to bring,
our football games to “a vast TV“aud-
ience. You know from press releases
that theatres in some cities carry the
game as it is played. On Sunday
evenings ABC is televising a film of
the game. We hope that all of you
enjoy these presentations of the Irish
in action. At. a future date CBS will
do a half-hour show on one of the
many research programs at Notre
Dame.

Dame—my deepest- gratitude for your
kindness _and‘ “your _ prayers for a

I. A. O’SHAUGHNESSY HALL
of Liberal and Fine Arts
6 Notre Dame
The new I. A. O’Shaughnessy Hall
of Liberal and Fine Arts, a magnifi-
cent $2,300,000 structure donated by
I. A. O’Shaughnessy, St. Paul, Minn.,
oil executive and philanthropist, was
solemnly dedicated on the Notre Dame
campus by His Eminence Samuel
Cardinal Stritch, Archbishop of Chi-
cago, following the celebration of a
Pontifical High Mass in the University
Drill Hall.
The Mass and dedication ceremon-
ies were attended by representatives
of more than eighty American col-
leges and universities, upwards of five
hundred Notre Dame faculty mem-
bers, the student body including 1,700
uniformed ROTC cadets, and hun-
dreds of distinguished guests.
George F. Kennan, former ambas-
sador to Russia, and Gordon K. Chal-
mers, president of Kenyon College,
received honorary degrees and deliv-
ered addresses at the academic con-
vocation. Degrees also were confer-
red on Sister M. Madeleva, C.S.C.,
president of St. Mary’s College, No-
tre Dame, Ind ; Jerome G. Kerwin,
professor of political science, Univer-
sity of Chicago; Daniel Sargent, au-
thor and educator of South Natick,
Mass.; and the Rev. Howard Ken-
na, C.S.C., president of Holy Cross
College, Washington, D. C., who
preached the sermon at the Ponti-
fical High Mass.
Kennan, who recently retired from
the foreign service, pointed to “forces
at large in our society which . .
march, in one way or another, under
the banner of an alarmed and exer-
cised anti-communism — but an anti-
communism of a quite special variety,
bearing an air of excited discovery
and proprietorship, as though no one
had ever known before that there was
a communist danger, as though no
one had ever thought about it and
taken its measure, as though it had
all begun about the year 1945 and
these people were the first to learn of
it.”
The frenzied kind of anti-commu-
nism represented by these forces, Ken-
nan said, constitute a real threat to
our universities and our country be-
cause they would “draw about us a
cultural curtain similar in some re-
spects to the iron curtain of our ad-
versaries.” The result, Kennan went
on, is “a species of cultural isolation
and provincialism wholly out of accord
with the traditions of our nation and
destined, if unchecked, to bring to our
intellectual and artistic life the same
sort of sterility from which the cul-
tural world of our communist adver-
saries is already suffering.”
“One has the impression,” Kennan
continued, “that if uncountered, these
people would eventually narrow the
area of political and cultural respec-
tability to a point where it included
only themselves, the excited accusers,
and excluded everything and every-
body not embraced in the profession
of denunciation.”
Kennan, who lived as a diplomat in
totalitarian countries, declared “I
know where this sort of thing leads.
. . . It cannot fail to have its effect on
the liberal arts, for it is associated
with two things that stand in deepest
conflict to the development of the
mind and spirit: with a crass material-
ism and anti-intellectualism on the one
hand, and with a marked tendency to-
ward standardization on the other.”
In an address on “The Life and the
Letter,” President Chalmers declared
His Eminence Cardinal Stritch blesses building.
that “liberal arts made it possible for
oncoming generations of thoughtful
men to see the facts as they are, to
avoid the blindness of reason run
amuck, and to see the relation of hu-
man reality to the truths of religion.”
“You hear it said,” Chalmers con-
tinued, “that the purpose of education
is to teach people to think. This is
not true. The purpose is to teach
people to sense what is important to
think about and to think about these
things in appropriate terms. Without
the liberal arts,” Chalmers said, “the
University can impart only the geo-
metric spirit; with them vigorous, free
and adequately taught, it is able to
undertake the elaborate human and
imaginative task of the higher learn-
ing in its fullness.”
In his sermon, Father Kenna de-
clared that “in proportion as Notre
Dame succeeds in giving religion its

ers, president, Kenyon College.
rightful place beside the other essen-
tials of a liberal education, it fulfills
the special purpose of its being* as an
institution.
“That education can rightly be call-
ed liberal,” Father Kenna said, “which
is the education of a man, not of an
engineer or a lawyer or a priest, but of
a man as a man. I do not attempt to
define such education, and perhaps
there is no adequate definition, but
can we agree that it must provide a
man with the knowledge and the skills
necessary for a good life — good for
himself, for his neighbors, for his
people and nation, for the vast race of
men.”
Mr. I. A. O’Shaughnessy, donor of
the $2,300,000 building bearing his
name and Mrs. O’Shaughnessy shared
the platform at the dedication cere-
monies with Cardinal Stritch and the
Rev. Theeodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C.
president of Notre Dame. Thomas
Reedy, River Forest, Ill., president of
the Student Senate, expressed the stu-
dents’ appreciation to the donor and
presented to Mr. and Mrs. O’Shaugh-
nessy a spiritual bouquet of more
than 7,000 Masses, Holy Communions
and prayers to be offered for their in-
tentions by the students.
Cardinal Stritch, citing O’Shaugh-
nessy Hall as “a tremendous manifes-
tation of faith in the University and
its students,” enjoined the student
body to “measure up to the faith and
hope that we Catholics and the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame have reposed
in you.”
A luncheon attended by more than
1,200 of the University’s guests was
the last in a series of dedication events.
Father Hesburgh expressed Notre
Dame’s appreciation to Mr. O’Shaugh-
nessy “on this day of joy and grati-
tude.”
“The heart of* Notre Dame has
been touched and strengthened by this
gift for which we have-been waiting
a hundred years and whose value it
will take us a hundred years to meas-
ure,” Father Hesburgh said.
The University of Notre Dame Glee
Club entertained at the luncheon with
several selections. Following* the
luncheon, guests of the University
toured the galleries, classrooms, stu-
dios and offices of O’Shaughnessy
Hall.
The Tudor-Gothic structure is be-
lievecl to be unique among collegiate
buildings. Included in its three wings
are classrooms, seminar rooms, and
offices for department heads and fac-
ulty members ; studios for the music
and fine art departments; and galler-
ies for the University’s art collection.
The three wings of the building are
joined by a six-story tower and a
beautifully decorated entrance hall.
Ground was broken for O’Shaugh-
nessy Hall in July, 1951, and the cor-
nerstone was laid in May, 1952. The
building, 450 feet in overall length,

FOREMEN Go to College
Notre Dame Offers Unique Course to Industrial Firms
Since World War II, American
industry has had an increasing con-
sciousness of the importance of hu-
man relations recognizing that tech-
nical efficiency and know-how are
far from the whole answer in the
successful operation of any business
enterprise. The most important ele-
ment of success derives from the abil-
ity to deal with people in a business sit-
uation. The growing significance of
this problem of dealing with people
is further emphasized by the increas-
ing degree of specialization and
mechanization which is widening the
gap between the man and his product.
Although this particular problem
pervades all areas of business, indus-
try agrees that the critical point is
at the foreman level because it is he
who represents management to the
vast army of workers. It follows,
therefore, that the morale and esprit
10 Notre Dame
de corps s of the working force is in
large ffiiea^ure determined by the
foreman’s" talents and abilities in the
human relations area.
Predicated upon this concept, the
Notre Dame Foremanship Develop-
ment Program was launched during
the past school year by the College
of Commerce to supplement the work
being done along these lines by in-
dustrv itself. It was felt that Notre
Dame with its facilities and staff
could make a significant contribution
to this problem since it is in a pos-
ition to bring- together in an academic
atmosphere the industrial foremen
from many companies for a free in-
terchange of ideas and techniques.
And, secondly, it is able to serve
many firms which, because of size,
are not equipped to establish their
own training programs.
This field of human relations in
business from the foreman’s point of
view takes on many aspects. First,
it is essential that the foreman have
a full appreciation of the philosophy
and operation of the American polit-
ical-economic system. Secondly, he
must be in a position to observe and
evaluate the group and individual
psychology of the workers under
varying business situations. Thirdly,
he must be capable of expressing
himself well both orally and in writ-
ing if he is to gain acceptance of
his ideas.
In accordance with these object-
ives, a fifteen week program has
been established with classes meeting
each Tuesday evening in the Com-
merce Building. The course work
embraces the three areas of basic
economics, human and labor rela-
tions and communications with five
weeks devoted to each.
In basic economics, the free en-
terprise system is defined and illus-
trated through consideration of Am-
erica’s growth and current economic
position, the determination of price
by the forces of supply demand, cor-
poration finance and accounting, the
money and banking system and, fin-
ally, the flow of income with some
attention to the causes of fluctuations
in business activity.
The human and labor relations
phase attempts to chart the history
of labor management as it explains
the psychology of today’s worker.
In addition, specific case discussions
illustrate the problems of change,
handling complaints and grievances,
maintaining discipline, building mor-
ale and co-operation among the work-
ers through consultative leadership.
This phase of the course makes wide
use of charts and other visual tech-
niques which serve as a basis for
free discussion of the problems in-
volved. In addition to case discus-
sion, many specific shop situations
are acted out by the participants in

the program with the remainder of
the class commenting on and criti-
cizing the way a specific situation is
handled.
The final phase of the program,
communications, aims at improving
the foreman’s ability to express him-
self clearly and concisely both orally
and in reports and letters. Here the
foreman learns by doing; short talks
given by the foremen are tape-re-
corded and then played back for
evaluation and appraisal by the class
as an aid to improving the speaker’s
skill.
Part of the success of the pro-
gram to date has been due to the
Mr. True (far right, standing) taught communications course to foremen.
emphasis placed on free discussion
by the participants in an informal
atmosphere. To aid this objective,
classes are limited to thirty men
each and large name cards are made
available to each man to facilitate
discussion.
The program is under the direction
of Mr. John R. Malone, Assistant
Professor of Business Administration
in the College of Commerce. Mr.
Malone, who also handles the basic
economics phase of the course, is a
1942 graduate of Notre Dame and
holds an MBA degree from the
Harvard Business School. He join-
ed the faculty at the University in
September following nine years as-
sociation with Owens-Corning Fiber-
glas Corporation in Toledo where he
was engaged in economic and market
research.
Mr. Wayne G. Anderson, Assist-
ant Professor of Business Adminis-
tration who handles the human and
labor relations phase, is a graduate
of Tulane University and holds a
masters degree from the University
of Iowa and his law degree from
Washington University, St. Louis.
Communications is under the guid-
ance of Mr. G. Herbert True, As-
sistant Professor of Advertising, who
holds his bachelors degree from the
University of Oklahoma and his mas-
ters degree from Northwestern Uni-
versity. Mr. True has had wide
experience in the advertising field
having been associated with agencies
in St. Louis and Kansas City and
with television stations WGN-TV
and WBKB-TV.
The program is under constant
change and modification as foreman
reactions on the job are measured
and evaluated by executives of the
participating firms including the

has negotiated with thi> electronics
group to bet up a program of funda-
mental study on electronic devices
dealing with atomic energy develop-
ment in fields which will provide
more protection and security for the
nation. On September 1st, special
work started on the campus which
consists of redevelopment of the
“electric eye” to the point where it
can detect types of radar commonly
caused by an A-bomb explosion.
As a result of outstanding work
done in electronics at Xotre Dame,

inaugurated with the opening of the
Fall semester in September. Four
priests have been assigned to devote
their full time as chaplains to each of
the University’s four undergraduate
classes. Rectors of the fourteen cam-
pus residence halls will work closely
with the class chaplains in implement-
ing the new plan.
‘‘Xotre Dame has grown so rapidly
in recent years that it is virtually im-
possible for one man to know all the
students,” the Reverend Charles Car-
ey, C.S.C., prefect of religion, ex-
plained. “This new program, institut-
ed by Father Theodore M. Hesburgb,
C.S.C.. president of the University,
will bring the students and chaplains
close together. Each chaplain will give
individual and personal attention to
problems of students in his class.”
Father Carey said. “A special effort
will be made to serve students living
off-campus," he added.
Each class will have a retreat i r
mission early in the school-year. Stu-
dents will continue to have the oppor-
tunity of attending daily Mass and
night prayer in the hall chapels and

Notre Dame’s first Parents-Son Day
was held last semester with more
than 300 parents, whose sons are
members of the Junior class, visiting
the campus and being conducted on
special guided tours of the Univers-
ity. The climax of the day came at
dinner when Rev. Theodore M. Hes-
burgh, C.S.C., president of Notre
Dame, spoke to the group. Stressing
informality, Father Hesburgh said,
“I want you parents to feel you be-
long here at Notre Dame as your
sons are the main part of our Uni-
versity.” He considered the Parents-
Son Day “definitely pointing to the
beginning of a tradition” and “next
o	o
year we hope to invite the parents
of all classes with a ‘day’ for each.”
From early registration in the lob-
by of the Morris Inn until a last-
minute stroll across the main rec-
tangle Sunday afternoon, the parents
were feted with such varied activities
as an ROTC drill exhibition given
by Air Force and Army teams, a
baseball game between Notre Dame
and Illinois, an unannounced intra-
squad football scrimmage in the sta-
dium, and a series of movies on cam-
pus life at Notre Dame.
Members of the Blue Circle, stu-

in answering questions and conduct-
ing guided tours throughout the spac-

symposium on “Religion and the
Crisis of the Twentieth Century.”
His article in the Jewish publication.
Commentary, on American Catholic-
ism was widely praised in the Cath-
olic press. Well known for his work
both in theology and laboi* research.
Dr. Herberg is currently studying the
relationship of religion to the social
sciences.
Conceding that there are some
grounds for Protestant apprehension,
Dr. Herberg said “it can hardly be
denied that the Protestant reaction
has been far out of proportion to
any conceivable threat or provoca-
tion.” He cited the issue of church
and state, particularly in education,
as the crux of a “growing accentua-
tion of the tension between the major
religious communities in this coun-
try.”
Canon Bernard Iddings Bell, noted
Episcopal lecturer and writer of the
University of Chicago, predicted that
“nothing but ruin lies ahead of us if
our schools continue to teach their
present brand of relativistic, expedi-
ential, short-view morality; we shall
go on, despite our boasting and our
technological achievements, from sor-
row to more sorrow. Thus it will be
with us as long as our schools ignore
God and the things of God, and so
fail to understand man and the things
of man,” Canon Bell said. Dr. Bell
has lectured at many American and
European universities and is a con-
sultant to Notre Dame’s Committee
on Self Study. He is the author of
Crisis in Education, among other
works, and has contributed a number
of articles to The Atlantic Monthly,
Harpers. LIFE, Reader’s Digest,
the New York Times and other pub-
lications.
“The Twentieth century is not only
the century of nihilistic despair and
bitter disappointment; it is also a
period of longing for faith and certi-
tude beyond the ups and downs of
social and political struggles,” Dr.
Waldemar Gurian, head of Notre
Dame’s Committee on International
Relations, sponsor of the symposium,
stated. “The Catholic church is ta-
ken seriously by many of those who
reject her claims of being the Church
founded by Christ, as a factor work-
ing for this faith and certitude.”
Pointing out that Catholicism to-
day “has lost the defensive apologetic

PULITZER PRIZE AWARDED
TO NOTRE DAME GRADUATE
Edward J. Mowery, a member of
the 1928 class at Notre Dame, has
been named a Pulitzer Prize winner
for 1953. He is a staff member of
the New York World-Telegram and
Sun and received this distinguished
award “for his reporting of the facts
which brought vindication and free-
dom” to Louis Hoffner, who had been
serving a life term for murder. A
Queens court found sufficient evidence
of perjury and lack of legal safe-
guards in the original trial and Hoff-
ner was freed, in large measure due
to the efforts of Mowery and his
newspaper.
Mr. Mowery has had a most suc-
cessful career in journalism. His Pul-
itzer award had already won the 1952
Polk Memorial Award, made by Long
Island University, and the Distin-
guished Service Award of the New
York Criminal and Civil Courts Bar
Association.

attitude of that of the 19th century,”
Dr. Gurian declared that “the Church
is neither liberal nor conservative.
She is a child of particular times, but
not inseparably married to any of
them. She has to teach and bring
salvation to all periods of history
with their changing social order and
atmosphere. . . . Though she partici-
pates in all centuries, she is not bound
to any of them. She is the embodi-
ment of history and tradition, just be-
cause she knows their changes, de-
velopments, and adaptations to new
needs.”
Dr. Wilhelm Pauck, of the Uni-
versity of Chicago’s Federated Theo-
logical Faculty, told the symposium
that secularism and the relation be-
tween religion and politics are two
of the most important problems fac-
ing American protestantism today.
“Protestantism must deal with secu-
larism,” Dr. Pauck declared. “It has
discovered that for the necessary
deepening of the religious life and
for the recovery of religious sub-
stance Fundamentalism and Modern-
ism are insufficient. Its theologians
turn more and more to a revived
Biblical theology, to the rediscovered
theology of the Reformers, to dialec-
tical theology and neo-orthodoxy,”
Pauck said. A prolific writer, Dr.
Pauck is the author of five books
including The Heritage of the Refor-
mation and is a frequent contributor
to theological journals.
Speaking on “The Church and
Modern Literature,” Professor Frank
O’Malley, of the University of Notre
Dame, said that “the great modern
novelists and poets of the Church
show that a Catholic literature is in
no sense to be thought of as narrow,
cosy, sectarian, or moralistic. Nor
is it to be expected that it can come
about through the agency of pious
evangels or of highly denominational-
ized periodicals,” O’Malley said.
Dr. Goetz Briefs, Georgetown Uni-
versity, in a paper on “Catholic So-
cial Thought Today” declared that
“in this hour of tribulation of the
western world, the social and political
doctrines of the Church have a
chance, and, in some countries, tre-
mendous weight. Confronted with
the alternative of an impossible re-
turn to Nineteenth Century social
creeds and policies on the one hand:
on the other with an inacceptable and
utterly alien totalitarianism, the Cath-
olic solution points to a reconstruction
of society which is equally distinct
from a society conceived as a mere
market mechanism and from a so-
ciety constructed along totalitarian
lines.”
Notre Dame’s Committee on In-
ternational Relations, sponsor of the
symposium, was organized in Octob-
er, 1949, by the University with the
partial support of a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation. The Com-
mittee is particularly interested in the
study of the ethical aspects and im-
plications of international relations.

Dr. ALBERT F. ZAHM.............
Pioneer of Aeronautical Science
by James E. Murphy
Doctor Albert F. Zahm, credited by
many as being the virtual founder of
modern aeronautical science, has re-
turned to live at the University of
Notre Dame, scene of many of his
pioneering experiments before the
turn of the century.
The distinguished 91-year-old sci-
entist built the first wind tunnel at
Notre Dame in 1882, more than
twenty years before the famed
Wright Brothers were to make their
historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina. Still displaying the same
enthusiasm for aviation as in his
early years. Dr. Zahm retired in 1945
after sixteen years as chief of the
aeronautical division of the Library
of Congress. From 1916 to 1929, he
served as director of the United
States Navy’s Aerodynamic Labora-
tory.
Zahm’s interest in flying originated
in a Notre Dame classroom more
than seventy years ago. “One day in
a Greek class’” he said, “the profes-
sor told the story of Daedalus and
Icarus, the two mythological charac-
ters who fashioned wings for them-
selves so they could fly. I decided
then and there to find a method of
flight,” Zahm said.
After his graduation from Notre
Dame in 1883, Zahm remained on the
campus to teach, continue his studies,
and conduct experiments then consid-
ered fantastic. He flew gliders off
the roof of Science Hall on the cam-
pus. He also constructed a universal
anemometer to record wind move-
ment. In 1885 Zahm received his
master’s degree at Notre Dame and
in later years was awarded an M. E.
degree at Cornell and a Ph.D. from
Johns Hopkins University.
Dr. Zahm organized and served as
the secretary of the International
Conference on Aerial Navigation held
at the Columbian Exposition in Chi-
cago in 1893 and read two papers at
the conference. One was entitled
“Atmospheric Gusts and their Rela-
tion to Flight’’ and the other was con-
cerned with the “Stability of Aero-
planes and Flying Machines.’’ The
conference was one of the most mem-
orable events in aeronautical history
in America.
From 1895-1908 he taught at the
Catholic University of America,
Washington, D. C., and continued his
aeronautical research. During this
period, he was asked if he thought
that the flying machine would ever
have any importance in the affairs of
humanity. Zahm said he replied that
the airplane would be of great im-
portance in transportation and would
revolutionize warfare.
An exemplary Catholic as well as
a renowned scientist, Dr. Zahm was
awarded Notre Dame’s Laetare Med-
al in 1925. Five years later Villa-
nova awarded him its Mendel Medal
as a tribute to his rich scientific ca-
reer.
In retirement only a few years.
Dr. Zahm continues his life-long
interest in aeronautics and av-
iation. Sunning himself on the Notre
Dame campus, he took note of a DC-
6 flying overhead. “Flying is fun,”
he said, “but people don’t fly for fun
anymore. People forget what fun it
is to fly!”
