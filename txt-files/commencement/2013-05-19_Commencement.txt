National Anthem:  The Star-Spangled Banner 
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Ceremonial garments worn at academic functions take their meaning from the original centers of learning of the Western world in the Church of the Middle Ages. Caps, hoods, and gowns of the early students and monks have been held through the centuries to be traditionally symbolic of the scholarly devotion so basic to education and to the deliberate and orderly evolution of knowledge. 
The introduction of classical studies, the gradual rise of the great universities across Europe, and the ever-increasing awareness of the decisive role of education in the entire development of civilization influenced leaders among academicians in their desire for a singular identity. In the attempt to create this differentiation, educators fell upon the medieval system of classic heraldry, whereby the coat of arms, assorted ornamental trappings, and patterns of colorful design had been adopted to denote the distinctive character of designated chivalric orders.  The function of “pedagogical heraldry” became, then, simply identification. As such, measures were taken to signify through distinctive markings on the academician’s attire the institution that had granted the degree, the field of learning in which the degree had been earned, and the level of the degree-bachelor, master or doctorate. 
Of the three pieces of academic attire, the cap, the gown, and the hood, it is the hood that offers the most abundant and most readily discernable information about its owner. The inner lining of the hood identifies the institution at which the individual earned the degree.  Some schools have adopted two-color patterns and introduced chevrons and bars in various designs to set themselves apart from other institutions.  The velvet trim bordering the hood indicates the major field of learning, or faculty, in which the degree has been earned. A final feature of the hood concerns its length and width and distinguishes further between holders of bachelor’s, master’s, and doctor’s degrees.  The length of the hood for the bachelor’s degree is three feet, closed at the bottom, and the velvet border is two inches.  At Notre Dame, those individuals receiving a bachelor’s degree do not wear a hood. A master’s degree holder has a hood three and one half feet in length with a three inch wide border, and is slit at the bottom. Those individuals with a doctorate degree wear a hood four feet in length, open at the bottom, with a five inch border. 

The gown is usually black in color but some American universities, including Notre Dame, have adopted distinctive colors for their robes. Notre Dame doctorate degree robes are blue, reflecting one of its official colors. 
The cut of the gown aids in differentiating between the three levels of degrees.  The bachelor’s gown is relatively simple and falls in straight lines from an elaborate yoke. It may be recognized most readily by the long, pointed sleeves. The master’s gown is somewhat fuller and bears no adornment.  The sleeves are oblong in shape and open at the wrist, with the rear part of the oblong square cut while the front edge has a cutaway arc. The doctor’s gown is more elaborate with velvet panels down the front and around the neck of the garment.  The sleeves are bell-shaped at the end and have three bars of the same material as the front panels at the upper portion of the arm.  It is cut rather full and may be ornamental in color.  Notre Dame’s doctoral gown has royal blue velvet front panels with the University’s shield embroidered in gold.  The royal blue sleeve chevrons are outlined in gold. 
The mortarboard or Oxford-type cap has been adopted throughout most universities in the United States, although Notre Dame’s doctoral cap is a royal blue tam. Colored tassels are usually worn by holders of the bachelor’s and master’s degrees. These denote the field of learning. The list on the next page indicates the tassel colors.  Gold tassels are reserved for those with doctorate degrees and governing officers of educational institutions.

We, as the Class of 2013, have experienced Notre Dame together. Amid football wins and losses, all-nighters for Organic Chemistry, SYRs and late night trips to the Grotto, it comes as no surprise that these are some of the most fantastic years of our lives.  Very soon now, we will become the newest members of the Notre Dame Alumni community. The Senior Legacy gives our class the opportunity to bridge the gap between our experience as students and our plan to give back to the University after graduation.
     The Steering Committee of the Senior Legacy is excited to share the creation of the Class of 2013 Scholarship, a needs based financial aid fund. It will be our way to help give the experience we have enjoyed to future students for whom a Notre Dame education would otherwise not be possible.
     Furthermore, it gives the Class of 2013 the ability to continue to contribute to this fund throughout the years and increase the annual impact of our giving, potentially aiding more and more students each year. Through the new pledge program, The Senior Legacy also invites members of the Class of 2013 to decide on how we seniors will give back to Notre Dame over the next three years. 



THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL 
The Presidential Medal was introduced at the inauguration of Notre Dame’s 16th President, the Reverend Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C. The medal, struck in bronze and plated in gold, was made by the Medallic Art Company, Danbury, Connecticut. 
The seal of the University forms the center of the medal and is mounted in relief against a larger cross representing the Congregation of Holy Cross, the religious community which founded the University in 1842. In traditional heraldry, the shield unsupported and central in the seal is appropriate for an institution of learning. At the base of the shield are two waves which symbolize the waves of Saint Mary’s Lake on whose shores the University was founded. In the upper left, the six-pointed star, considered the perfect form, signifies “Star of the Sea,” a title accorded the Virgin Mary for whom Notre Dame is named. A cross symbolizes Christianity.  The open book, emblematic of education, is inscribed with the Latin words, “Vita, Dulcedo, Spes,” or “Our life, our sweetness, and our hope.” These words, first addressed to Our Lady by Saint Bernard, are taken from the familiar prayer, “Salve Regina,” or “Hail Holy Queen.” 


THE UNIVERSITY MACE 
The academic scepter, or mace, was one of the earliest distinctive signs of medieval university officials. The mace was originally a wooden staff carried by royal messengers. The early wooden staff on the university beadle, a subaltern official, evolved in the 14th century into an elaborate silver mace. It was carried by the beadle during processions and graduation ceremonies, and was displayed as a symbol to command order during classes. In the 15th century it became symbolic of academic dignity. An essential part of the mace was the staff or cylindrical rod (tibia), originally a tube of silver filled with wood or some other base materials. The staff, divided into several sections, was held together by a ring-shaped excrescence (nodus). The staff was crowned with a bell-shaped head (caput); at the base was a finial (membrum terminale). 
The Notre Dame mace was designed and executed by the late Reverend Anthony Lauck, C.S.C., professor emeritus of art, art history, and design. The bronze caput repeats the University seal found on the Presidential Medal, but brings the star outside the shield where its separate rendering emphasizes the patronage of the Virgin Mary. Its shaft is in walnut and the star and the finial bear the University colors gold and blue.
