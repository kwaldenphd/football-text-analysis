PROFESSION OF FAITH 
We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. 
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, 
begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven: 
All bow at the following words 11p lo: and became man. 
by the power of the Holy Spirit He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. 
Al-le-lu-ia-:----' 
Matthew 16:24-28 
For our sake He was crucified 
under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried. On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand 
of the Father. He will·-come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. 
5 
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the 'giver of life, who proceeds from the Father 
and the Son. With the Father and the Son He is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the prophets. 

PRAYER OF THE FAITHFUL 
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism 
for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

The Academic Costume Code 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its sources chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, although mediae• val scholars tended to adopt a collegiate costume. A stat• ute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the University of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th cen• tury, civilian collegiate costume was specified in various regulations of the universities. European institutions con• tinue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic cos· tume is prescribed by the American Council of Education, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first sug• gestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, following an educational conference at Columbia Univer• sity. In 1902, the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was created. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for official university and college colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Excep­tions have been granted to specific universities upon request
