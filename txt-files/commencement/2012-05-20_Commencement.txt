You are God: we praise you; You are seated at God’s right hand in glory. You are the Lord; we acclaim you; We believe that you will come, and be our judge. You are the eternal Father: all creation worships you. Come then, Lord, sustain your people, To you all angels, all the powers of heaven, bought with price of your own blood Cherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise; and bring us with your saints to everlasting glory. “Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might, Heaven and earth are full of your glory.” Save your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance. 
Govern and uphold them now and always. The glorious company of apostles praise you. Day by day we bless you; The noble fellowship of prophets praise you. We praise your name forever. The white-robed army of martyrs praise you. Today, Lord, keep us from all sin. Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you; Have mercy on us. Father of majesty unbounded, true and only Son, Lord, show us your love and mercy. Worthy of all worship, and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide. For we put our trust in you. You, Christ, are the King of Glory, eternal Son of the Father. In you, Lord, is our hope, may we never be confounded.   When you became man to set us free You did not disdain the Virgin’s womb. AMEN. 
You overcame the sting of death and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.

LITURGY OF THE WORD 
READING I (read in Spanish) Please be seated 
ACTS 1:1–11 In the first book, Theophilus, I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught until the day he was taken up, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after he had suffered, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God. While meeting with them, he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for "the promise of the Father about which you have heard me speak; for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit." 
When they had gathered together they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?" He answered them, "It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has established by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight. While they were looking intently at the sky as he was going, suddenly two men dressed in white garments stood beside them. They said, "Men of Galilee, why are you standing there looking at the sky? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you have seen him going into heaven."

PROFESSION OF FAITH  Please stand  
I believe in one God, the Father almighty,  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,  
maker of heaven and earth,  he suffered death and was buried,  
of all things visible and invisible.  and rose again on the third day  
I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,  in accordance with the Scriptures.  
the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages.  He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  
God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead  
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;  and his kingdom will have no end.  
through him all things were made.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,  
For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven,  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,  
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,  
All bow at the following words up to: and became man.  who has spoken through the prophets.  
I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.  
and by the Holy Spirit  I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins  
was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man.  and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead  
and the life of the world to come.  AMEN.

Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Ceremonial garments worn at academic functions take their meaning from the original centers of learning of the Western world in the Church of the Middle Ages. Caps, hoods, and gowns of the early students and monks have been held through the centuries to be traditionally symbolic of the scholarly devotion so basic to education and to the deliberate and orderly evolution of knowledge. 
The introduction of classical studies, the gradual rise of the great universities across Europe, and the ever-increasing awareness of the decisive role of education in the entire development of civilization influenced leaders among academicians in their desire for a singular identity. In the attempt to create this differentiation, educators fell upon the medieval system of classic heraldry, whereby the coat of arms, assorted ornamental trappings, and patterns of colorful design had been adopted to denote the distinctive character of designated chivalric orders.  The function of “pedagogical heraldry” became, then, simply identification. As such, measures were taken to signify through distinctive markings on the academician’s attire the institution that had granted the degree, the field of learning in which the degree had been earned, and the level of the degree-bachelor, master or doctorate. 
Of the three pieces of academic attire, the cap, the gown, and the hood, it is the hood that offers the most abundant and most readily discernable information about its owner. The inner lining of the hood identifies the institution at which the individual earned the degree.  Some schools have adopted two-color patterns and introduced chevrons and bars in various designs to set themselves apart from other institutions.  The velvet trim bordering the hood indicates the major field of learning, or faculty, in which the degree has been earned. A final feature of the hood concerns its length and width and distinguishes further between holders of bachelor’s, master’s, and doctor’s degrees.  The length of the hood for the bachelor’s degree is three feet, closed at the bottom, and the velvet border is two inches.  At Notre Dame, those individuals receiving a bachelor’s degree do not wear a hood. A master’s degree holder has a hood three and one half feet in length with a three inch wide border, and is slit at the bottom. Those individuals with a doctorate degree wear a hood four feet in length, open at the bottom, with a five 
inch border. The gown is usually black in color but some American universities, including Notre Dame, have adopted distinctive colors for their robes. Notre Dame doctorate degree robes 
are blue, reflecting one of its official colors. 
The cut of the gown aids in differentiating between the three levels of degrees.  The bachelor’s gown is relatively simple and falls in straight lines from an elaborate yoke. It may be recognized most readily by the long, pointed sleeves. The master’s gown is somewhat fuller and bears no adornment.  The sleeves are oblong in shape and open at the wrist, with the rear part of the oblong square cut while the front edge has a cutaway arc. The doctor’s gown is more elaborate with velvet panels down the front and around the neck of the garment.  The sleeves are bell-shaped at the end and have three bars of the same material as the front panels at the upper portion of the arm.  It is cut rather full and may be ornamental in color.  Notre Dame’s doctoral gown has royal blue velvet front panels with the University’s shield embroidered in gold.  The royal blue sleeve chevrons are outlined in gold. 
The mortarboard or Oxford-type cap has been adopted throughout most universities in the United States, although Notre Dame’s doctoral cap is a royal blue tam. Colored tassels are usually worn by holders of the bachelor’s and master’s degrees. These denote the field of learning. The list on the next page indicates the tassel colors.  Gold tassels are reserved for those with doctorate degrees and governing officers of educational institutions.

Each year Notre Dame’s senior class supports a program or project that will make a lasting impact on student life. The Senior Legacy demonstrates each class’s appreciation for its Notre Dame experience and gives graduating seniors the opportunity to help ensure that future students are able to enjoy all of the benefits of a Notre Dame education. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the seniors and all of the alumni and friends of the University who have so generously chosen to make a donation to Our Lady’s University. Notre Dame relies on these gifts to continually offer the best experience possible, and all of the students are deeply grateful for your unwavering support. Our class has chosen to dedicate our legacy to the Declan Drumm Sullivan Memorial Scholarship. Declan was our beloved classmate, and we have chosen to support this memorial scholarship in his name. The Declan Drumm Sullivan Memorial Scholarship will benefit scholarship-winning students who share Declan’s passions.  Our legacy expresses our fond memory of Declan and our support for the University.  If you would like to contribute to the Class of 2012’s Senior Legacy or to the Notre Dame Annual Fund, please visit Supporting.nd.edu/senior legacy. 



THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL 
The Presidential Medal was introduced at the inauguration of Notre Dame’s 16th President, the Reverend Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C. The medal, struck in bronze and plated in gold, was made by the Medallic Art Company, Danbury, Connecticut. 
The seal of the University forms the center of the medal and is mounted in relief against a larger cross representing the Congregation of Holy Cross, the religious community which founded the University in 1842. In traditional heraldry, the shield unsupported and central in the seal is appropriate for an institution of learning. At the base of the shield are two waves which symbolize the waves of Saint Mary’s Lake on whose shores the University was founded. In the upper left, the six-pointed star, considered the perfect form, signifies “Star of the Sea,” a title accorded the Virgin Mary for whom Notre Dame is named. A cross symbolizes Christianity.  The open book, emblematic of education, is inscribed with the Latin words, “Vita, Dulcedo, Spes,” or “Our life, our sweetness, and our hope.” These words, first addressed to Our Lady by Saint Bernard, are taken from the familiar prayer, “Salve Regina,” or “Hail Holy Queen.” 


THE UNIVERSITY MACE 
The academic scepter, or mace, was one of the earliest distinctive signs of medieval university officials. The mace was originally a wooden staff carried by royal messengers. The early wooden staff on the university beadle, a subaltern official, evolved in the 14th century into an elaborate silver mace. It was carried by the beadle during processions and graduation ceremonies, and was displayed as a symbol to command order during classes. In the 15th century it became symbolic of academic dignity. An essential part of the mace was the staff or cylindrical rod (tibia), originally a tube of silver filled with wood or some other base materials. The staff, divided into several sections, was held together by a ring-shaped excrescence (nodus). The staff was crowned with a bell-shaped head (caput); at the base was a finial (membrum terminale). 
The Notre Dame mace was designed and executed by the late Reverend Anthony Lauck, C.S.C., professor emeritus of art, art history, and design. The bronze caput repeats the University seal found on the Presidential Medal, but brings the star outside the shield where its separate rendering emphasizes the patronage of the Virgin Mary. Its shaft is in walnut and the star and the finial bear the University colors gold and blue.
