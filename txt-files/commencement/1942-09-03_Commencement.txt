Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we· hailed at the twilight's last ·gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we ·watched, were so gallantly streaming?' And the rocket's red glare. the _bombs bursting in air, · · Gave proof through the night that our flag. was still there, 
CHORUS 
Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave ·. O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
