Academic Attire 

Ceremonial garments worn at academic functions take their meaning from the original centers oflearning of the Western world in the Church ofthe Middle Ages. Caps, hoods and gowns ofthe early students and monks have been held through the centuries to be traditionally symbolic ofthe scholarly devotion so basic to education and to the deliberate and orderly evolution of knowledge. 
The introduction ofclassical studies, the gradual rise of the great universities across Europe, and the ever­increasing awareness of the decisive role of education in the entire development of civilization influenced leaders among academicians in their desire for a singular identity. In the attempt to create this differentiation, educators fell upon the medieval system of classic heraldry, whereby the coat ofarms, assorted ornamental trappings, and patterns of colorful design had been adopted to denote the distinctive character ofdesignated chivalric orders. The function of"pedagogical heraldry" became, then, simply identification. As such, measures were taken to signify through distinctive markings on the academician's attire the institution that had granted the degree, the field of learning in which the degree had been earned, and the level of the degree-bachelor, master or doctorate. 
Of the three pieces of academic attire, the cap, the gown and the hood, it is the hood that offers the most abundant and most readily discernable information about its owner. The inner lining ofthe hood identifies the institution at which the individual earned the degree. Some schools have adopted two-color patterns and introduced chevrons and bars in various designs to set themselves apart from other institutions. The velvet trim bordering the hood indicates the major field of learning, or faculty, in which the degree has been earned. The list at the conclusion of this section will explain this relationship. A final feature of the hood concerns its length and width and distinguishes further between holders of bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees. The length ofthe hood for the bachelor's degree is three feet, closed at the bottom, and the velvetborder is two inches. At Notre Dame, individuals receiving a bachelor's degree do not wear a hood. A master's degree holder has a hood three and one halffeet in length with a three inch wide border, and is slit at the bottom. Those individuals with a doctorate degree wear a hood four feet in length, open at the bottom, with a five inch border. 
The gown is usually black in color but some American universities, including Notre Dame, have adopted distinctive colors for their robes. Notre Dame doctorate degree robes are blue, reflecting one of its official colors. 
The cut ofthe gown aids in differentiating between the three levels of degrees. The bachelor's gown is relatively simple and falls in straight lines from an elaborate yoke. It may be recognized most readily by the long, pointed sleeves. The master's gown is somewhat fuller and bears no adornment. The sleeves are oblong in shape and open at the wrist, with the rear part of the oblong square cut while the front edge has a cutaway arc. The doctor's gown is more elaborate with velvet panels down the front and around the neck of the garment. The sleeves are bellshaped at the end and have three bars of the same material as the front panels at the upper portion ofthe arm. It is cut rather full and may be ornamental in color. Notre Dame's doctoral gown has royal blue velvet front panels with the University's shield embroidered in gold. The royal' blue sleeve chevrons are outlined in gold. 
The mortarboard or Oxford-type cap has been adopted throughout most universities in the United States, although Notre Dame's. doctoral cap. is a royal blue tam. Colored tassels are usually worn by holders of the bachelor's and master's degrees. These denote the field oflearning. The list on the next page indicates the tassel colors. Gold tassels are reserved for those with doctorate degrees and governing officers of educational institutions. 


Processional Banners 

(Gonfalons) 

The gonfalon, a banner that hangs from a crosspiece or frame, originated in the medieval republics of Italy as an ensign of state or office. Gonfalons have been adopted in many universities around the world as college or institutional insignias, and many use them to identify and lead colleges and schools within the university in academic procession. The nine gonfalons represent the University and the eight colleges and schools of Notre Dame. 
The lower half of the gonfalon consists of a shield with a clear blue field and a cross of gold. This is part of the armorial seal designed by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard in 1931. The heraldic colors (gold and blue) are symbolic of the Mother of God, to whom, Father Sorin first dedicated Notre Dame. At the shield's base arc two wavy lines (indicating the a Lacu, "of the Lake," in the University's official title), and above them to the left is a star, another emblem of the Virgin, Star of the Sea. The cross represents the Congregation of Holy Cross, which founded Notre Dame; an institution of learning is denoted by the open book. The phrase "Vitcr, Dlllccdo, Spcs," taken from the ancient prayer to the Virgin, the Scrlvc Regina, celebrates her as "life, sweetness, and hope."

Symbol of Office 
THE UNIVERSITY MACE 

The academic scepter, or mace, was one of the earliest distinctive signs ofmedieval university officials. The mace was originally a wooden staffcarried by royal messengers. The early wooden staff on the university beadle, a subaltern official, evolved in the 14th century into an elaborate silver mace. It was carried by the beadle during processions and graduation ceremonies, and was displayed as a symbol to command order during· classes. In the 15th century it became symbolic of academic dignity. An essential part of the mace was the staff or cylindrical rod (ti/Jia), originally a tube of silver filled with wood or some other base materials. The staff, divided into several sections, was held together by a ring-sh_aped excrescence (noclus). The staff was crowned with a bell-shaped head (caput); at the base was a finial (mcm/Jnmz tcnninalc). 
The Notre Dame mace was designed and executed by Rev. Anthony Lauck, C.S.C., professor emeritus of art, art history and design. The bronze caput repeats the University seal found on the Presidential Medal, but brings the star outside the shield where its separate rendering emphasizes the patronage ofthe Virgin Mary. Its shaft is in walnut and the star and the finial, bear the University colors gold and blue.
