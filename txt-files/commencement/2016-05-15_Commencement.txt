National Anthem:  The Star-Spangled Banner 
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
—Key

Our time at Notre Dame will never be forgotten. We are grateful for our families that have supported us, faculty who have inspired us, and friends who have shared with us some of the most incredible moments of our lives. Through Senior Legacy we have come to understand the deep commitment that Notre Dame alumni have made for us during our time together. There is no better way to express our gratitude than to join them in supporting future Notre Dame students. 
In expressing our gratitude, Senior Legacy calls upon the Senior Class to make a three-year pledge to the University. Whether giving back means joining the Corby Society or making a smaller pledge, every person can make an impact. Our goal is to have the entire Senior Class participate, coming together one last time in remembrance of the amazing memories we have made at Notre Dame.

The Presidential Medal was introduced at the inauguration of Notre Dame’s 16th President, the Reverend Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C. The medal, struck in bronze and plated in gold, was made by the Medallic Art Company, Danbury, Connecticut. 
The seal of the University forms the center of the medal and is mounted in relief against a larger cross representing the Congregation of Holy Cross, the religious community which founded the University in 1842. In traditional heraldry, the shield unsupported and central in the seal is appropriate for an institution of learning. At the base of the shield are two waves which symbolize the waves of Saint Mary’s Lake on whose shores the University was founded. In the upper left, the six-pointed star, considered the perfect form, signifies “Star of the Sea,” a title accorded the Virgin Mary for whom Notre Dame is named. A cross symbolizes Christianity.  The open book, emblematic of education, is inscribed with the Latin words, “Vita, Dulcedo, Spes,” or “Our life, our sweetness, and our hope.” These words, first addressed to Our Lady by Saint Bernard, are taken from the familiar prayer, “Salve Regina,” or “Hail Holy Queen.” 
The academic scepter, or mace, was one of the earliest distinctive signs of medieval university officials. The mace was originally a wooden staff carried by royal messengers. The early wooden staff on the university beadle, a subaltern official, evolved in the 14th century into an elaborate silver mace. It was carried by the beadle during processions and graduation ceremonies, and was displayed as a symbol to command order during classes. In the 15th century it became symbolic of academic dignity. An essential part of the mace was the staff or cylindrical rod (tibia), originally a tube of silver filled with wood or some other base materials. The staff, divided into several sections, was held together by a ring-shaped excrescence (nodus). The staff was crowned with a bell-shaped head (caput); at the base was a finial (membrum terminale).
The Notre Dame mace was designed and executed by the late Reverend Anthony Lauck, C.S.C., professor emeritus of art, art history, and design. The bronze caput repeats the University seal found on the Presidential Medal, but brings the star outside the shield where its separate rendering emphasizes the patronage of the Virgin Mary. Its shaft is in walnut and the star and the finial bear the University colors gold and blue.
