The Academic Costume Code 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its sources chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, although mediae­val scholars tended to adopt a collegiate costume. A stat­
ute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the University of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th cen­tury, civilian collegiate costume was specified in various regulations of the universities. European institutions con­tinue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic cos­tume is prescribed by the American Council of Education, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first sug­gestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, following an educational conference at Columbia Univer­sity. In 1902, the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was created. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for official university and college colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Excep­tions have been granted to specific universities upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves ( with a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell•shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns do not have trimmiµgs. The Doctor's gown is faced down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and closed at the end; The Doctor's hood is four feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or colors of the college or university which conferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is distinctive of the subject field. 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mor­tarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fastened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doctor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. University administrators may also have a tassel of gold thread.
