THE SONG OF NOTRE DAME 
By Francis C. Schwab, •o: 
0 Notre Dame, thou-beauteous place, Where Nature teems, where Nature teems,· And learning calmly grows apace, While fancy dreams, while fancy dreams; We love thee for thy goodly worth, We love thy name, we love thy name­It is the sweetest name on earth, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Norte Dame. 
Although thou are not sere with age; We honor thee, we honor thee, And when the wintry tempests rage, 
We love to sec, we love to see Thy towers pointing to the sky, With steady aim, with steady aim, As though the storms thou wouldst defy, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Notre Dame.
