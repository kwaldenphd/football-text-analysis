Crown him"with man -y crowns, The Lamb up • on his throne; 
Crown him the Lord of lave! Be • hold his hands and side; 
Crown him the Lo.rd of life, Who tri • umphed o'er the grave, 

Hark! how the heav'n-ly an -them drowns all mu • sic but its own! Rich wounds, yet vis -i -hie a -hove, In beau •ty glo -ri -fled; And rose vie -to -rious in the_ strife For those he came to save. 

raise  my voice  and  sing  Of  him who  died  for  me  
No  an  - gel  in  the  sky  Can  fol  -ly  bear that  sight,  
His  glo  - ries  now  we  sing  Who  died and  rose  on  high,  


J JI J J J JI 0 di 
And hail him as my match-less King Thru all e • ter • ni -ty! But down-ward turns his bum -ing eye At mys • ter -ies so bright! Who died, e -ter -nal life to bring, And lives that death may die!

Love Divine, All Loves Excelling text: Charles Wesley 
tune: Rowland H. Prichard 
Love divine, all loves excelling, Joy of heaven, to earth come down! Fix in us thy humble dwelling, All thy faithful mercies crown. 
Jesus, thou art all compassi·on, Pure unbounded love thou art; Visit us with thy salvation, Enter every trembling heart. 
Come, almighty to deliver, Let us all thy life receive; Suddenly return, and never, Never more thy temples leave. 
Thee we would be always blessing, Serve thee as thy hosts above, Pray, and praise thee without ceasing, Glory in thy jJrecious love.
