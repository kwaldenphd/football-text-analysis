THE ACADEMIC COSTUME CODE 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds -its sources chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, although mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a collegiate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, licentiates and Bachelors" of the University of Coinibra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th century, civilian collegiate costume was specified in various regulations of the universities. European institutions continue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Educatiori, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first suggestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, fol­lowing an educational conference at Columbia Univ.,-rsity, In 1902, the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was created. II codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for official university and college colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Exceptions have been gra_nted lo specific universities upon request, 
GOWNS, Black cotton with long pointed sleeves·for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves (with a slit for. the arms) :for the Master's Deg-ree, and bell•shaped open ;leeves for th~ Doctor's· D~gree, The Ba~helor's and ·Master's gowns do not have trimmings. The Doctor's gown· is. laced d·own the front with black velvet and th.ere are three bars of velvet across _the sleeves, 
HOODS: Black in all cases. Far the Master's it is three. and ane•half feet long and closed al the end•.The_ Doctor's hood is four feel long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or colors ·01 the college or university which conferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is distinctive of the subject field. 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so•called mortarboard style, Each cap has a long tassel fastened to·_ the ·middle p_oinl of ·the lop of the cap. The tassel color denoi~-s th~ subj~ci fl~ld:° The Da~tor;s ~ap may have a tassel of gold thread. University a·dminislrators may also have a tassel of gold thread,_
