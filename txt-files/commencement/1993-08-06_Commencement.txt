ACADEMIC ATTIRE 
Ceremonial gannents worn at academic functions take their meaning from the original centers of learning of the Western world in the Church of the Middle Ages. Caps, hoods and gowns of the early students and monks have been held through the centuries to be traditionally sym­bolic of the scholarly devotion so basic to education and to the deliberate and orderly evolution of knowledge. 
The introduction of classical studies, the gradual rise of the great universities across Europe, and the ever-increas­ing awareness of the decisive role of education in the entire development of civilization influenced leaders among academicians in their desire for a singular identity. In the attempt to create this differentiation, educators fell upon the medieval system ofclassic heraldry, whereby the coat of arms, assorted ornamental trappings, and patterns of colorful design had been adopted to denote the distinc­tive character ofdesignated chivalric orders. The function of "pedagogical heraldry" became, then, simply iden­tification. As such, measures were taken to signify through distinctive markings on the academician's attire the institution that had granted the degree, the field of learning in which the degree had been earned, and the level of the degree -bachelor, master or doctorate. 
Of the three pieces of academic attire, the cap, the gown and the hood, it is the hood that offers the most abundant and most readily discernible infonnation about its owner. The inner lining of the hood identifies the institution at which the individual earned the degree. Some schools have adopted two-color patterns and introduced chevrons and bars in various designs to set themselves apart from other institutions. The velvet trim bordering the hood indicates the major field of learning, or faculty, in which the degree has been earned. The list at the conclusion of this section will explain this relationship. A final feature of the hood concerns its length and width and distin­guishes further between holders of bachelor's, master's,· and doctor's degrees. The length of the hood for the bachelor's degree is three feet, closed at the bottom, and the velvet border is two inches. At Notre Dame, in­dividuals receiving a bachelor's degree do not wear a hood. A master's degree holder has a hood three and one half feet in length with a three inch wide border, and is slit at the bottom. Those individuals with a doctorate degree wear a hood four feet in length, open at the bottom, with a five inch border. 

The gown is usually black in color but some American universities, including Notre Dame, have adopted distinc­tive colors for their robes. Notre Dame doctorate degree robes are blue, reflecting one of its official colors. 
The cut of the gown aids in differentiating between the three levels of degrees. The bachelor's gown is relatively simple and falls in straight lines from an elaborate yoke. It may be recognized most readily by the long, pointed sleeves. The master's gown is somewhat fuller and bears no adornment. The sleeves are oblong in shape and open at the wrist, with the rear part of the oblong square cut while the front edge has a cutaway arc. The doctor's gown is more elaborate with velvet panels down the front and around the neck of the gannent. The sleeves are bell­shaped at the end and have three bars of the same material as the front panels at the upper portion of the ann. It is cut rather full and may be ornamental in color. Notre Dame's doctoral gown has royal blue velvet front panels with the University's shield embroidered in gold. The royal blue sleeve chevrons are outlined in gold. 
The mortarboard or Oxford-type cap has been adopted throughout most universities in the United States, although Notre Dame's doctoral cap is a royal blue tam. Colored 
tassels are usually worn by holders of the bachelor's and master's degrees. These denote the field of learning. The list on the next page indicates the tassel colors. Gold tassels are reserved for those with doctorate degrees and governing officers of educational institutions.
