PROFESSION OF FAITH 
We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. 
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven: 
All bow at the fallowing words up to: and became man. 
by the power of the Holy Spirit He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. 
For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried.

Pange Lingua ....................................................................................................G.P. Colonna tune: Chant, Pange Lingua text: St. Thomas Aquinas 
Sing, my tongue, the Savior's glory, On the night of that last supper 
Of His flesh the myst'ry sing. Seated with His chosen band, 
Of the Blood all price exceeding, He, the Paschal victim eating, 
Shed by our immortal King, First fulfills the Law's command; 
Destined for the world's redemption, Then as food to all His brethren 
Our Lord from virgin womb co-spring. Gives Himself with His own hand. 
Of a pure and spotless Virgin Word made Flesh, the bread of nature Born for us on earth below, By His word to flesh He turns; He as Man, with us conversing, Wine into His Blood He changes, Stayed the seed of truth to sow; What, though sense no change discerns? Then He closed in solemn order Only be the heart in earnest, Wondrously His life of woe. Faith does her lesson quickly learn.

Academic Costume Code 
The Academic Costume Code 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its sources chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, although mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a col­legiate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the Univer­sity of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th century, civilian collegiate costume was specified in various regula­tions of the universities. European institutions con­tinue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Education, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first suggestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, following an educational con­ference at Columbia University. In 1902, the Inter­collegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was cre­ated. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for of­ficial university and college colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Exceptions have been granted to specific universities upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves (with a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell-shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns do not have trimmings. The Doctor's gown is faced down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and closed at the end. The Doctor's hood is four feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or colors of the college or university which con­ferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is di~tinctive of the subject field.

CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mortarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fas­tened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doc­tor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. Univer­sity administrators may also have a tassel of gold thread.
