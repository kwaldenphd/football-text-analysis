We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only son ofGod, eternally begotten of the Icather, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us and for our salvation He came down from heaven:

All bow at the following words up to: and became man. 
by the power of the Holy Spirit He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. 
For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried. 
On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the 
Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. 
Response: Lord, hear our prayer.

We believe in the Holy Spirit, 
the Lord, the giver oflife, 
who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son He is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the prophets.

Academic Attire 
Ceremonial garments worn at academic functions take their meaning from the original centers oflearning ofthe Western world in the Church of the Middle Ages. Caps, hoods and gowns ofthe early students and monks have been held through the centuries to be traditionally symbolic ofthe scholarly devotion so basic to education and to the deliberate and orderly evolution of knowledge. 
The introduction ofclassical studies, the gradual rise of the great universities across Europe, and the ever­increasing awareness of the decisive role of education in the entire development of civilization influenced leaders among academicians in their desire for a singular identity. In the attempt to create this differentiation, educators fell upon the medieval system of classic heraldry, whereby the coat ofarms, assorted ornamental trappirtgs, and patterns of colorful design had been adopted to denote the distinctive character ofdesignated chivalric orders. The function of"pedagogical heraldry" became, then, simply identification. As such, measures were taken to signify through distinctive markings on the academician's attire the institution that had granted the degree, the field of learning in which the degree had been earned, and the level of the degree-bachelor, master or doctorate. 
Of the three pieces of academic attire, the cap, the gown and the hood, it is the hood that offers the most abundant and most readily disccrnable information about its owner. The inner lining of the hood identifies the institution at which the individual earned the degree. Some schools have adopted two-color patterns and introduced chevrons and bars in various designs to set themselves apart from other institutions. The velvet trim bordering the hood indicates the major field of learning, or faculty, in which the degree has been earned. The list at the conclusion of this section will explain this relationship. A final feature of the hood concerns its length and width and distinguishes further 
bet:lveen holders of bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees. The length ofthe hood for the bachelor's degree 

is three feet, closed at the bottom, and the velvet border is two inches. At Notre Dame, individuals receiving a bachelor's degree do not wear a hood. A master's degree holder has a hood three and one halffeet in length with a three inch wide border, and is slit at the bottom. Those individuals with a doctorate degree wear a hood four feet in length, open at the bottom, with a five inch border. 
The gown is usually black in color but some American universities, including Notre Dame, have adopted distinctive colors for their robes. Notre Dame doctorate degree robes are blue, reflecting one of its official colors. 
The cut of the gown aids in differentiating between the three levels of degrees. The bachelor's gown is relatively simple and falls in straight lines from an elaborate yoke. It may be recognized most readily by the long, pointed sleeves. The master's gown is somewhat fuller and bears no adornment. The sleeves arc oblong in shape and open at the wrist, with the rear part of the oblong square cut while the front edge has a cutaway arc. The doctor's gown is more elaborate with velvet panels down the front and around the neck of the garment. The sleeves arc bellshaped at the encl and have three bars of the same material as the front panels at the upper portion of the arm. It is cut rather full and may be ornamental in color. Notre Dame's doctoral gown has royal blue velvet front panels with the University's shield embroidered in gold. The royal blue sleeve chevrons arc outlined in gold. 
The mortarboard or Oxford-type cap has been adopted throughout most universities in the United States, although Notre Dame's doctoral cap is a royal blue tam. Colored tassels arc usually worn by holders of the bachelor's and master's degrees. These denote the field oflcarning. The list on the next page indicates the tassel colors. Gold tassels are reserved for those with doctorate degrees and governing officers of educational institutions. · 

Processional Banners 
(Gonfalons) 
The gonfalon, a banner that hangs from a crosspiece or frame, originated in the medieval republics of Italy as an ensign of state or office. Gonfalons have been adopted in many universities around the world as college or institutional insignias, and many use them to identify and lead colleges and schools within the university in academic procession. The nine gonfalons represent the University and the eight colleges and schools of Notre Dame. 
The lower half of the gonfalon consists of a shield with a clear blue field and a cross o_f gold. This is part of the armorial seal designed by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard in 1931. The heraldic colors (gold and blue) arc symbolic of the Mother of God, to whom, Father Sorin first dedicated Notre Dame. At the shield's base arc two wavy lines (indicating the a Lacu, "of the Lake," in the University's official title), and above them to the left is a star, another emblem of the Virgin, Star of the Sea. The cross represents the Congregation of Holy Cross, which founded Notre Dame; an institution of learning is denoted by the open book. The phrase "Vita, Dulcedo, Spes," taken from the ancient prayer to the Virgin, the Salve Regina, celebrates her as "life, sweetness, and hope." 

Gonfalons designed by Paul Wieber ofNotre Dame Publications and Graphic Services, commissioned by Watra Clwrclt Goods, Chicago, aml manufactured by Slabbinck ofBrugge, Belgium.

THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL 
The Presidential Medal was introduced at the inauguration of Notre Dame's 16th President, the Reverend Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C. The medal, struck in bronze and plated in gold, was made by the Medallic Art Company, Danbury, Connecticut. 
The seal of the University forms the center of the medal and is mounted in relief against a larger cross representing the Congregation of Holy Cross, the religious community which founded the University in 1842. In traditional heraldry, the shield unsupported and central in the seal is appropriate for an institution oflcarning. At the base ofthe shield are two waves which symbolize the waves ofSt. Mary's Lake on whose shores the university was founded. In the upper left, the six­pointed star, considered the perfect form, signifies "Star of the Sea," a title accorded the Virgin Mary for whom Notre Dame is named. A cross symbolizes Christianity. The open book, emblematic of education, is inscribed with the Latin words, "Vita, Dulceclo, Spes," or "Our Life, our sweetness, and our hope." These words, first addressed to Our Lady by Saint Bernard, arc taken from the familiar prayer, "Salve Regina," or "Hail Holy Queen." 
THE UNIVERSITY MACE 
The academic scepter, or mace, was one of the earliest distinctive signs ofmedieval university officials. The mace was originally a wooden staff carried by royal messengers. The early wooden staff on the university beadle, a subaltern official, evolved in the 14th century into an elaborate silver mace. It was carried by the beadle during processions and graduation ceremonies, and was displayed as a symbol to command order during classes. In the 15th century it became symbolic of academic dignity. An essential part of the mace was the staff or cylindrical rod (tibia), originally a tube of silver filled with wood or some other base materials. The staff, divided into several sections, was held together by a ring-shaped excrescence (nodus). The staff was crowned with a bell-shaped head (caput); at the base was a finial (membrum tcnninale). 
The Notre Dame mace was designed and executed by Rev. Anthony Lauck, C.S.C., professor emeritus of art, art history and design. The bronze caput repeats the University seal found on the Presidential Medal, but brings the star outside the shield where its separate rendering emphasizes the patronage ofthe Virgin Mary. Its shaft is in walnut and the star and the finial, bear the University colors gold and blue.
