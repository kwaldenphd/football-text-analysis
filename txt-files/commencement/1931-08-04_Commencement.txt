0 Notre Dame, thou beauteous place, Where Nature teems, where Nature teems, And learning calmly grows apace, 
l 
While fancy dreams, while fancy dreams; We love thee for thy goodly worth, We love thy name, we love thy name­It is the sweetest name on earth, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Notre Dame. 
i' Although thou art not sere with age, \Ve honor thee, we honor thee, And when the wintry tempests rage, We love to s~e, we love to see Thy towers pointing to the sky, With steady aim, with steady aim, As though the storms thou ,vouldst defy, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Notre Dame. 
And when the summer sky shines warm, And skies are blue, and skies are blue, Bedecked with flowers of every form And varied hue, and varied hue; Oft fancy fond will thee recall, And memory claim, and memory claim Our hearts when life's deep shadows fall, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Notre Dame.
