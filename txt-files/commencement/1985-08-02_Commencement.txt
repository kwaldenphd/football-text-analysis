HYMN text: Matthew Bridges
Crown Him With Many Crowns 
Godfrey Thring 

Crown him"with man -y crowns, The Lamb up -on his throne; Crown him the Lord of love! Be -hold his hands and side; Crown him the Lord of life, Who tri -umphed o'er the grave, 

Hark! how the heav'n -ly an -them drowns all mu -sic but its own! Rich wounds, yet vis -i -ble a -bove, In beau -cy glo -ri -fled; And rose vie -to -rious in the_ strife For those he came to save. 

raise  my voice  and  sing  Of  him who  died  for  me  
No  an  - gel  in  the  sky  Can  ful  -ly  bear that  sight,  
His  glo  - ries  now  we  sing  Who  died and  rose  on  high,  

And hail him as my match-less King Thru all e -ter -ni -cy! But down-ward turns his bum -ing eye At mys -ter • ies so bright! Who died, e -ter -nal life to bring, And lives that death may die!

Love divine, all loves excelling, 
Joy of heaven, to earth come down! 
Fix in us thy humble dwelling, 
All th)' faithful mercies crown. 
Jesus, thou art all comJ;assi-on, 
Pure unbounded love thou art; Visit us with thy salvation, 
Enter every trembling heart. 
Come, almighty to deliver, Let us all thy life receive; 
Suddenly return, and never, 
Never more thy temf1les leave. 
Thee we would be always blessing, Serve thee as th0y hosts above, Pray, and praise thee without ceasing, Glor,, in thy J1recious love.

Academic Costume Code 
THE ACADEMIC COSTUME CODE 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its source chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, al­though mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a colle­giate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the Univer­sity of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th century, civilian colle­giate costume was specified in various regulations of the universities. European institutions continue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Ed­ucation, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first suggestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, following an educational conference at Columbia University. In 1902, the Intercollegiate Bu­reau of Academic Costumes was created. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearing­house and "repository" for official university and col­lege colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below . . Exceptions have been granted to specific universities 
upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves (with a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell­shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns do not have trim­mings. The Doctor's gown is faced down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and closed at the end. The Doctor's hood is four feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or col­ors of the college or university which conferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is dist~nctive of the subject field. 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mortarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fastened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doctor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. University administrators may also have a tassel of gold thread.
