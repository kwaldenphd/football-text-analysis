Sine Nomine .........................................................................................R. Vaughan Williams Come Holy Spirit, Come ····················································-···························David C. Isele 
Come, though Holy Spirit, come! And from thy celestial home 
Shed a ray of light divine! Come thou Father of the poor! Come, thou source of all our store. 
Come, within our bosoms shine. Thou, of comforters the best; Thou, the soul's most welcome guest; Sweet refreshment here below; 
In our labor, rest most sweet; Grateful coolness in the heat; 
Solace in the midst of woe. 0 most blessed Light divine, Shine within these hearts of thine, 
And 011r inmost being fill! IYhere thou art not, man hath naught, Nothing good in deed or thought, Nothing free from taint of ill. Heal our wounds, our strength renew; On our dryness pour thy dew; Wash the stains of guilt away; 
Bend the stubborn heart and will; Melt the frozen, warm the chill; 
Guide the steps that go astray. On the faithful, who adore And confess thee, evermore 
In thy sevenfold gift descend; Give them virtue's sure reward; Giue them thy salvation, Lord; Give them joys that never end. Amen. Alleluia.

To you all angels, all the powers of heaven, Cherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise; "Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might, Heaven and earth are full of your glory." 
The glorious company of apostles praise you. The noble fellowship of prophets praise you. The white•robed army of martyrs praise you. Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you; Father of majesty unbounded, true and only Son, Worthy of all worship, and the Holy Spirit, 
advocate and guide.

You did not disdain the Virgin's womb. 
You overcame the sting of death and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers. 
You are seated at God's right hand in glory. We believe that you will come, and be our judge. 
Come, then Lord, sustain your people, brought with the price of your own blood and bring 11s with your saints to everlasting glory. 
Save your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance. Govern and uphold them now and always. 
Day by day we bless you; We praise your name forever. Today, Lord, keep us from all sin. Have mercy on us. Lord, show us your love and mercy For we put our trust in you. In you Lord is our hope, may we never be confounded.

PROFESSION OF FAITH 
We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. 
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, tight from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven: 
All bow at the fallowing words up to: and became man. 
by the power of the Holy Spirit He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. 
For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried.

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father 
and the Son. With the Father and the Son He is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the prophets. 
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism 
for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

Choir: 3. Lo! th' apostles' holy train join thy sacred Name to hallow; Prophets swell the glad refrain, and the white-robed martyrs follow And from morn to set of sun, through the Church the song goes on.

Kathleen Erin O'Hora, Midland, Michigan Academic Costume Code 
The Academic Costume Code 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its sources chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, although mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a col­legiate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the Univer­sity of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th century, civilian collegiate costume was specified in various regula­tions of the universities. European institutions con­tinue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Education, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first suggestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, following an educational con­ference at Columbia University. In 1902, the Inter­collegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was cre­ated. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for of­ficial university and college colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Exceptions have been granted to specific universities upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves ( with a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell-shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns d9 not have trimmings. The Doctor's gown is faced down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and· closed at the end. The Doctor's hood is four feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or colors of the college or university which con­ferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is distinctive of the subject field. 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mortarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fas­tened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doc­tor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. Univer­sity administrators may also have a tassel of gold thread. ­
