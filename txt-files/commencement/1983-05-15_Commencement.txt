PROFESSION OF FAITH 
We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. 
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us and for our salvation He came down from heaven: 

GENERAL INTERCESSIONS 
All how at the following words up to: and became man. 
by the power of the Holy Spirit He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. 
For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried. 
On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand 
of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. 
Please stand. 
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father 
and the Son. With the Father and the Son He is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the prophets. 
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism 
for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

Academic Costume Code 
The Academic Costume Code 

The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its source chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, although mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a col­legiate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the Univer­sity of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th century, civilian collegiate costume was specified in various regula­tions of the universities. European institutions con­tinue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Education, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first suggestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, following an educational con­ference at Columbia University. In 1902, the Inter­collegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was cre­ated. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for of­ficial university and college colors, costumes and ms1gma. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Exceptions have been granted to specific universities upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves (with a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell-shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns do not have trimmings. The Doctor's gown is faced down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and closed at the end. The Doctor's hood is four feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or colors of the college or university which con­ferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is distinctive of the subject field. 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mortarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fas­tened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doc­tor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. Univer­sity administrators may also have a tassel of gold thread.
