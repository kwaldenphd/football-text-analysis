0 Notre Dame, thou beauteous place Where Nature teems, where nature teems, And learning calmly grows apace, While fancy dreams, while fancy dreams; We love thee for thy goodly worth, We love thy name, we love thy name,­It is the sweetest name on earth, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Notre Dame. 
Although thou art not sere with age, We honor thee, we honor thee, And when the wintry tempests rage, We love to see, we love to see Thy towers pointing to the sky, With steady aim, with steady aim, As though the storm thou wouldst defy, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Notre Dame. 
And when the summer sun shines warm, And skies are blue, and skies are blue, Bedecked with flowers of every form And varied hue, and varied hue; Oft fancy fond will thee recall, And mem'ry claim, and mem'ry claim Our hearts when life's deep shadows fall, 0 Notre Dame, 0 Notre Dame.
