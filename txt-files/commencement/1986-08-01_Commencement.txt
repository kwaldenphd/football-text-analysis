Academic Costume Code 
THE ACADEMIC COSTUME CODE 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its source ~hiefly in ecclesiastical wear, al­though mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a colle­giate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the Univer­sity of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th century, civiiian colle­giate costume was specified in various regulations of the unjversities." European institutions continue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic 
wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Ed­ucation, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first suggestion for a uniform code was_ made in May, 1895, following an educational conference at Columbia University. In 1902, the Intercollegiate Bu­reau of Academic Costumes was created. It codified the 1895 rules and its. legal-firm serves as a clearing­house and "repository" for official university and col­lege colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Exceptions have been granted to specific universities upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves (With a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell­shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns do not have trim­mings. The Doctor's gown is faced· down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and closed at the end. The Doctor's hood is four feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or col­ors of the college or university which conferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is distinctive of the subject field. 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mortarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fastened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doctor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. University administrators may also have a tassel of gold thread.
