We believe in one Lord,Jesus Christ, the only Son ofGod, eternally begollen of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made, For us and for our salvation He came down from heaven:

up lo: and became man, by the power of the Holy Spirit He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. 
For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried, 
On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand 
of the Father, He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end,

THE ACADEMIC COSTUME CODE 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its source chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, al­though mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a colle­giate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the Univer­sity of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half of the 14th century, civilian col­legiate costume was specified in various regulations of the universities. European institutions continue to show great diversity in their specifications of aca­demic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Education, and its present form was adopted in 1932. The first suggestion for a uniform code was made in May, 1895, following an educational con­ference at Columbia University. In 1902, the Inter­collegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was cre­ated. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for official university and college colors, costumes and insignia. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Exceptions have been granted to specific universities upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves (with a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell­shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns do not have trim­mings. The Doctor's gown is faced down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and closed at the end. The Doctor's hood is four feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or colors of the college or university which conferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is distinctive of the subject field. 
 
88 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mortarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fas­tened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doctor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. University ad­ministrators may also have a tassel of gold thread.
