OPENING PRAYER 

READING I (read in Spanish) Acts 1:1–11 Please be seated. 
In the first book, Theophilus, I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught until the day he was taken up, after giving instructions through the holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after he had suffered, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God. While meeting with them, he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for “the promise of the Father about which you have heard me speak; for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the holy Spirit.” When they had gathered together they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?" He answered them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has established by his own authority. But you will receive power when the holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.“When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight. While they were looking intently at the sky as he was going, suddenly two men dressed in white garments stood beside them. They said, “Men of Galilee, why are you standing there looking at the sky? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you have seen him going into heaven.”

National Anthem: The Star-Spangled Banner 
Oh, say can you see by the dawn’s early light 
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight, 
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. 
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Academic Attire 

Ceremonial garments worn at academic functions take their meaning from the original centers of learning of the Western world in the Church of the Middle Ages. Caps, hoods and gowns of the early students and monks have been held through the centuries to be traditionally symbolic of the scholarly devotion so basic to education and to the deliberate and orderly evolution of knowledge. 
The introduction of classical studies, the gradual rise of the great universities across Europe, and the ever-increasing awareness of the decisive role of education in the entire development of civilization influenced leaders among academicians in their desire for a singular identity. In the attempt to create this differentiation, educators fell upon the medieval system of classic heraldry, whereby the coat of arms, assorted ornamental trappings, and patterns of colorful design had been adopted to denote the distinctive character of designated chivalric orders. The function of “pedagogical heraldry” became, then, simply identification. As such, measures were taken to signify through distinctive markings on the academician’s attire the institution that had granted the degree, the field of learning in which the degree had been earned, and the level of the degree-bachelor, master or doctorate. 
Of the three pieces of academic attire, the cap, the gown and the hood, it is the hood that offers the most abundant and most readily discernable information about its owner. The inner lining of the hood identifies the institution at which the individual earned the degree. Some schools have adopted two-color patterns and introduced chevrons and bars in various designs to set themselves apart from other institutions. The velvet trim bordering the hood indicates the major field of learning, or faculty, in which the degree has been earned. The list at the conclusion of this section will explain this relationship. A final feature of the hood concerns its length and width and distinguishes further between holders of bachelor’s, master’s, and doctor’s degrees. The length of the hood for the bachelor’s degree is three feet, closed at the bottom, and the velvet border is two inches. At Notre Dame, those individuals receiving a bachelor’s degree do not wear a hood. A master’s degree holder has a hood three and one half feet in length with a three inch wide border, and is slit at the bottom. Those individuals with a doctorate degree wear a hood four feet in length, 
open at the bottom, with a five inch border. 
The gown is usually black in color but some American universities, including Notre Dame, have adopted distinctive colors for their robes. Notre Dame doctorate degree robes are blue, reflecting one of its official colors. 
The cut of the gown aids in differentiating between the three levels of degrees. The bachelor’s gown is relatively simple and falls in straight lines from an elaborate yoke. It may be recognized most readily by the long, pointed sleeves. The master’s gown is somewhat fuller and bears no adornment. The sleeves are oblong in shape and open at the wrist, with the rear part of the oblong square cut while the front edge has a cutaway arc. The doctor’s gown is more elaborate with velvet panels down the front and around the neck of the garment. The sleeves are bellshaped at the end and have three bars of the same material as the front panels at the upper portion of the arm. It is cut rather full and may be ornamental in color. Notre Dame’s doctoral gown has royal blue velvet front panels with the University’s shield embroidered in gold. The royal blue sleeve chevrons are outlined in gold. 
The mortarboard or Oxford-type cap has been adopted throughout most universities in the United States, although Notre Dame’s doctoral cap is a royal blue tam. Colored tassels are usually worn by holders of the bachelor’s and master’s degrees. These denote the field of learning. The list on the next page indicates the tassel colors. Gold tassels are reserved for those with doctorate degrees and governing officers of educational institutions. 



Senior Legacy 
Each year Notre Dame’s senior class supports a program or project that will make a lasting impact on student life. The Senior Legacy demonstrates each class’s appreciation for its Notre Dame experience, and gives graduating seniors the opportunity to help ensure that future students are able to enjoy all of the benefits of a Notre Dame education. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the seniors and all of the alumni and friends who have so generously chosen to make a donation to Our Lady’s University. Notre Dame relies on these gifts to continually offer the best experience possible, and all of the students are deeply grateful for your unwavering support. 
This year, the senior class voted to support the Hesburgh Libraries by creating The Class of 2010 Library Endowment. The Hesburgh Library is a widely-recognized campus landmark and a beacon of Notre Dame’s commitment to academic excellence. A university’s distinction and reputation invariably corresponds with the depth and breadth of its library collections and information services. By establishing a library endowment, the Class of 2010 has shown a commitment to maintaining Notre Dame’s exceptional academic standards and a desire to continue the legacy of our beloved president emeritus, the Rev. Theodore 
M. Hesburgh, C.S.C. 
The Student Development Committee and the Annual Fund would like to thank Thomas and Laura Woodward, parents of Katherine Woodward ’10, for establishing the Woodward Senior Legacy Challenge. The Woodwards’ generosity enhanced the prestige and visibility of the Class of 2010 Senior Legacy, and helps ensure that the Class of 2010 Library Endowment will be a significant source of funding for the Hesburgh Libraries’ collections. 
The Senior Legacy is a student-run program within Notre Dame’s Annual Fund. Through the Senior Legacy, students learn more about the value of giving back to Notre Dame. Gifts to the Annual Fund are a key source of expendable support for the University and help provide funds for financial aid, student activities, and academic enrichment.

The Presidential Medal was introduced at the inauguration of Notre Dame’s 16th President, the Reverend Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C. The medal, struck in bronze and plated in gold, was made by the Medallic Art Company, Danbury, Connecticut. 
The seal of the University forms the center of the medal and is mounted in relief against a larger cross representing the Congregation of Holy Cross, the religious community which founded the University in 1842. In traditional heraldry, the shield unsupported and central in the seal is appropriate for an institution of learning. At the base of the shield are two waves which symbolize the waves of St. Mary’s Lake on whose shores the University was founded. In the upper left, the six-pointed star, considered the perfect form, signifies “Star of the Sea,” a title accorded the Virgin Mary for whom Notre Dame is named. A cross symbolizes Christianity. The open book, emblematic of education, is inscribed with the Latin words, “Vita, Dulcedo, Spes,” or “Our Life, our sweetness, and our hope.” These words, first addressed to Our Lady by Saint Bernard, are taken from the familiar prayer, “Salve Regina,” or “Hail Holy Queen.” 
The academic scepter, or mace, was one of the 

earliest distinctive signs of medieval university officials. 
The mace was originally a wooden staff carried by royal messengers. The early wooden staff on the university 
beadle, a subaltern official, evolved in the 14th century 
into an elaborate silver mace. It was carried by the beadle during processions and graduation ceremonies, and was displayed as a symbol to command order during classes. In the 15th century it became symbolic of academic dignity. An essential part of the mace was the staff or cylindrical rod (tibia), originally a tube of 
silver filled with wood or some other base materials. 
The staff, divided into several sections, was held together by a ring-shaped excrescence (nodus). The staff was crowned with a bell-shaped head (caput); at the base was a finial (membrum terminale). 
The Notre Dame mace was designed and executed by the late Rev. Anthony Lauck, C.S.C., professor emeritus of art, art history and design. The bronze caput repeats the University seal found on the Presidential Medal, but brings the star outside the shield where its separate rendering emphasizes the patronage of the Virgin Mary. Its shaft is in walnut and the star and the finial, bear the University colors gold and blue.
