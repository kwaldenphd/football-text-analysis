Academic Costume Code 
The Academic Costume Code 
The history of academic dress reaches far back into the early days of the oldest universities. Academic dress finds its source chiefly in ecclesiastical wear, although mediaeval scholars tended to adopt a col­legiate costume. A statute of 1321 required that all "Doctors, Licentiates and Bachelors" of the Univer­sity of Coimbra (Portugal) wear gowns. Beginning with the second half_ of the 14th century, civilian collegiate· costume was specified in various regula­tions of the universities. European institutions con­tinue to show great diversity in their specifications of academic wear. 
In American colleges and universities, the academic costume is prescribed by the American Council of Education, and its present' form was adopted in 1932. ~he first suggestion for a uniform code was. made in May, 1895, following an educational con­ference at Columbia University. In 1902, the Inter­collegiate Bureau of Academic Costumes was cre­ated. It codified the 1895 rules and its legal firm serves as a clearinghouse and "repository" for of­~ci~l _university and college colors, costumes and ms1gma. 
The present academic dress consists of gown, hood and cap with the pattern and trimmings listed below. Exceptions have been granted to specific universities upon request. 
GOWNS: Black cotton with long pointed sleeves for the Bachelor's Degree, long closed sleeves (with a slit for the arms) for the Master's Degree, and bell-shaped open sleeves for the Doctor's Degree. The Bachelor's and Master's gowns do not have trimmings. The· Doctor's gown is faced down the front with black velvet and there are three bars of velvet across the sleeves. 
HOODS: Black in all cases. For the Master's it is three and one-half feet long and closed at the end. The Doctor's hood is four· feet long with panels at the sides. All hoods are lined with the official color or colors of the college or university which con­ferred the highest degree. The edging of the hood is velvet and three inches and five inches in width for· the Master's and Doctor's degrees, respectively, while its color is distinctive of the subject field. 
CAPS: Black cotton and stiffened into the so-called mortarboard style. Each cap has a long tassel fas­tened to the middle point of the top of the cap. The tassel color denotes the subject field. The Doc­tor's cap may have a tassel of gold thread. Univer­sity administrators may also have a tassel of gold thread.
