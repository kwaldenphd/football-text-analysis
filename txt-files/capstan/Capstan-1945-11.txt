FOR ULTIMATE SERVICES RENDERED
“That was the guiding spirit in the conference at
San Francisco.
“That is why the United Nations are determined that
there shall be no next war.
Harry S. Truman
President of the United States
■ August 9, 1945
“That was the guiding spirit in the conference at
Berlin.
No one can foresee what another war would mean to
our own cities and to our own people. What we are
doing to Japan now—even with the new atomic bomb
—is only a small fraction of what would happen to
the world in a third world war.
They deserve as a living monument to their sacrifice, the achieve-
ment of permanent peace by the United Nations working in harmony.
• To the thousands of Americans, including the seventy-eight graduates
of the Notre Dame U.S.N.R. Midshipmen’s School, who gave their
lives for this victory, we respectfully dedicate this ninth and last Capstan.
‘That is why the ,United Nations are determined to
remain united and strong. We can never permit
any aggressor in the future to be clever enough to .
divide us or strong enough to defeat us.
“That will be the guiding spirit in the peace settle-
ment to come.	_

You young officers, the last graduates of a school which has a justifiably proud record of Reserve Officer	■
training, leave Notre Dame with a unique opportunity, and an equally unique responsibility.,	,	;-
All of you should have, at least, a six months period of interesting and pleasant sea duty, in a training	;
status, which, with the stress of actual combat removed, will have all the aspects of a peacetime shake-	i
down cruise. But that sea duty will probably, of necessity, be involved in patrol and occupational	j.
control of former enemy territory and you, therefore, will become an important part in the most difficult	?
task ever faced by a victorious nation—that of shaping and enforcing a lasting peace and spreading the	J.
principles of democratic and Christian humanity among the peoples involved. ’ '	'
I feel confident that the high traditions of the U. S. Navy, and the high ideals of our country, will	‘
act as your guide in the.responsible duties that lie ahead of you, and that your peace-time duties
will be fulfilled just as loyally and efficiently as have the war time duties of those who have gone from	|
this school before you.	. ,	;
Good luck to you all.	‘	-	J. Richard Barry	J

Commander George Hutchinson, U.S.N., Executive Officer of the Notre Dame U. S. Naval Reserve
Midshipmen’s School, a 1935 graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy, assumed his duties here 7 January
1945. Previous to his assignment here, he served nine and a half years of continuous sea duty in both
the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, participating in the bombardment of Guadalcanal and Munda air-
field on New Georgia Island and took part in the invasion of Southern France. During his tours of duty
his ships assisted in the sinking of one Japanese arid three German Subinarines. In May of this year
Commander Hutchinson received his second Bronze Star, awarded for meritorious achievement as
commanding officer of the U.S.S. Macomb.
Commander Hutchinson, of Newton, Massachusetts, is married and the father of three children.
His family was living in Pearl Harbor during the December 7 attack on the naval base. On September
24, 1945, Commander Hutchinson became Executive Officer of the N.R.O.T.C. Unit at Notre Dame,
relieving Commander Ralph T. McDaniel. He will be Executive Officer of both the N.R.O.T.C. and
the Midshipmen’s School until the latter is decommissioned about December 1, after which he will
remain at Notre Dame as Executive Officer of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.

Captain Burnett, first Commanding Officer
for the midshipmen’s school at Notre Dame.
As we take our leave from the good ship USNRMS Notre Dame, few of us realize that we are closing an
eventful chapter in the history of the school. Within the past five years, in addition to more than 10,000
midshipmen, many NROTC’s, Navy V-12’ers, and Marine V-12’ers have passed through these ivy-covered
portals on their way to greater Naval duties.
The first inkling that Notre Dame might in some way join hands with its traditional football rival, Navy,
was when Rev. John Cavanaugh, C.S.C. was called to Washington in the fall of 1940. Not long after, in the
spring of 1941, a civilian NROTC unit was established. This group broke the old tradition of having stu-
dents segregated by classes, for all the NRO’S were placed in Walsh Hall.
Thus, later that year when Admiral Nimitz gave his Navy Day address on the campus concerning “the
impending war with Japan”, his words were prophetic of what was to happen in a few short months. After
the shock of Pearl Harbor, Notre Dame became even more of a Navy school. The abundance of men’s
dormitories, ample facilities for drilling and athletics, and the convenient location of the school buildings
made it an ideal spot for training large numbers pf men. In April of 1942, just as Doolittle and his com-
panions were providing the Allies with their first good news in the Japanese war, V-7 indoctrinecs began
their series of four week courses, which were followed by twelve week midshipman courses at Abbot Hall,
Chicago. These short courses didn’t last long, for in October Notre Dame was designated as one of the
USNR Midshipman Schools, and 1300 men arrived from civilian life to help fill the urgent need for Navy
officers. This first class had a better-background of experience than any of the following “G”, or deck,
classes. Most of the men had two to four years business experience under their belts in addition to college
degrees. It was Captain H. P. Burnett and Lt. Cmdr. Richard Wagner, as commanding officer and execu-
tive officer respectively, who guided these first middies through their course.
The birth pains of a midshipmen’s school are many. It was during this period that the men not only had
to go to classes, but they also had to stand up in them. Yes, that’s right, there weren’t enough chairs in the
new classroom building. Not only was the ingenuity of the student taxed, but the new instructors had to
improvise without the aid of text books. One of the best examples of instructor ingenuity was the-scale
operating model of a 4"/50 gun constructed by Lt. R. C. Urban of the Ordnance Department, now Lt.
Commander and Head of the Academic Department. Despite such magnificent efforts, at the time the
European war reached its turning point with the invasion of North Africa, the middies were having ord-
nance drills with 4 loading machines, a range finder, and a torpedo afterbody of 1918 vintage. At least
they weren’t harrassed by Damage Control and Recognition for those courses hadn’t yet been added
as obstacles.
Of course, all was not study. There were always watches. But, the first class did have its good times.

great hit over WSBT and also over a nation-wide hook-up. Then, the “Happy Hour” staged by the middies
was a great success, due in no small part of the fact that many of the performers were professionals before
their arrival at Notre Dame. Yes, they even had a newspaper, “The Sea Chest”, which provided many
worthwhile and amusing notes. One example was an article printed to console the boys in Badin Hall, by
telling them of an old Notre Dame frosh dorm, the “cardboard castle”, of which the freshmen said that
“even with all the doors and windows shut, the papers still blew off their desks!”
•Then, as graduation day approached, the love bug seemed to hit the regiment. On that day the news-
papers claimed that 418 of the 1097 graduates had marriage planned as their first step after commissioning.
Quite a record. The new Ensigns were graduated in the newly constructed drill hall, and were addressed
by Rear Admiral John Downes, then Commandant of the Ninth Naval District. Among these Ensigns was
John Parle, who later at the cost of his life, saved his shipmates, his ship, and possibly a landing operation
off Sicily by snatching a burning smoke pot from a boat load of explosives.
By the time the second Midshipman Class arrived in February, 1943 most of the rough spots in the school
routine had been ironed out, and things had settled down to a steady grind. The Drill Hall was completed
and more and better equipment began to pour in. Damage Control was now added as a separate course
and became one of the joys (?) of the program. Since the classroom building had no room for the new
department, Lyons Annex became its home.	,
The desire to utilize the abilities and talents of those engineering and technical school graduates who
were physically disqualified for sea and combat duty led to the establishment, in February, 1943, of the two
• month “Specialist” course. This further complicated the school schedule since the normal “General”
courses in Ordnance, Seamanship, and Naval Engineering had to be intensified and Compass Compensation
substituted for Navigation. But the results were well worth the added effort, and from February, 1943, to
October, 1944, 2,500 highly trained and valuable officers were sent out to various shore station billets in
ordnance, inspection, research, supply depots, navy yards, naval aviation and engineering.
The third class, which arrived in May, 1943, began the trend toward younger midshipmen. That trend
became more noticeable as the newly formed V-12 College Program sent its youngsters to the Midshipmen’s
Schools. Ori June 1st, 1943, Lt. Cmdr. Milton Fairchild replaced Lt. Cmdr. Wagner as Executive Officer.
A third Naval Training Unit was added to the Notre Dame campus on July 1st, 1943, when a huge group
of 1850 prospective V-12 sailors and marines arrived. The feeding arrangements necessary to take care of
the three Naval Units and the civilian students became a complicated job in itself. During this period a
Glee Club was formed. It was called “the Capt. Burnett Choir” and became a popular local radio feature.
On September 30, 1943, the fourth midshipman class, composed chiefly of eighteen- and nineteen-year
olds from V-12 schools, arrived at Notre Dame to be confronted with one more addition to the course—
[ 19 1

Lord, and pass the ammunition,” during a visit to Notre Dame.
Recognition. However, the gods of war took pity on these lads, and delayed.until the start of the fifth class
the completion of the Dark Room, and thus the beginning of the Night Vision and Lookout classes.
Notre Dame and South Bend now accepted the Midshipman as part of their way of life, and the towns-
people (God Bless ’em) who each week took middies home for Sunday dinners “just like Mom’s” set more	■
and more places at their crowded but happy tables.
Augmentation and intensification of the courses as new knowledge and improved technique became
known continued throughout the school’s career. More equipment and training aids increased the drill
organization of the school, and by January, 1944 the academic staff had increased to 88 officers.	-
In a simple but impressive ceremony on 24 October, 1944, Captain H. P. Burnett, commanding officer
of the school since its beginning, was relieved by Captain J. Richard Barry. Thus Captain Barry, veteran
of thirty-nine years of service to his country, became Commanding Officer of the Notre Dame United States
Naval Reserve Midshipman School. He was continually called upon to participate in local ceremonies of
dedication and public drives in connection with the country’s war effort. These included the presenta-
tion of the “Army-Navy E” to the Studebaker Corporation, the dedication of the Honor Roll of the same
corporation, a Memorial Day address, and the dedication of the Honor Roll of St. Joseph County.	-
The fifth class set some sort of a record with eighteen couples walking up to South Bend altars immediate-
ly after graduation. However, only one of the brides was a native of South Bend. This was a low per-
centage for the South Bend girls, considering their four months of uncontested time.
In March,'1944, Lt. Cmdr. T. C. Scaffe, USN, Ret., became executive officer of the school, replacing
Lt. Cmdr. M. D. Fairchild.	•
• The sixth class was honored by the presence of Vice Admiral Randall Jacobs, Chief of the Bureau of
(	Naval Personnel, as the principal speaker at its graduation. At this time Admiral Jacobs told the men
that they were entering the war in its fourth, or offensive stage, but that war was not a game in which	’
they could rest during the fourth quarter.	•
. With the addition of the A.R.B. and U.S.S. Wilmette cruise programs, the practical drill work of thy
school was again increased, and the complement of officers in the academic staff reached ninety-eight be
January, 1945.	.
It was the sixth class which held four midshipman dances, all in the Drill Hall, thus giving the Middies a
chance to bring the South Bend (yes, and Mishawaka too) girls to the campus.	.—■>	i
During the life of the seventh class the school received its present Executive Officer, Commander George	’

duty, mostly on destroyers, in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. In May of this year Commander Hutchin-
son received his second Bronze Star, awarded for “distinguishing himself by meritorious achievement as
commanding officer of the U.S.S. Macomb prior to and during the amphibious invasion of Southern France
in August, 1944.”
One of the ironies of the graduation of the February class took place when a Rear Admiral missed his
son’s graduation. Coming to South Bend from Chicago, Dr. Thomas H. Parran, Surgeon General of the
United States Public Health Service, was delayed by car trouble, and arrived at Notre Dame, to greet his
son, Theodore V. Parran as Ensign Parran instead of Midshipman Parran.
Class ten participated in the VE-Day ceremonies, which were similar in form to those of VJ-Day, to
occur only three short months later. Those who were present say that the weather was bad, and that all
hands returned to their normal routine immediately following the exercises. There was yet a war to be won.
The tenth graduating class received the “word” about the 30,000 officers needed for the regular peace-
time Navy directly from the Undersecretary of the Navy. The Undersecretary, Artemus L. Gates, de-
livered the principal address to the 730 graduates of the next to last class to graduate.
The highlight of entertainment for the Notre Dame school was the Bob Hope Show, May 29,1945, when
Hope, along with Vera Vague, Jerry Calonna, Frances Langford, Herbert Marshall, Tony Romano, and
Bing Crosby, gave his regular Tuesday broadcast from Washington Hall, with the Midshipmen as audience.
On the Monday preceding, the entire group had given a War Bond Show to 50,000 people packed into the
Notre Dame Stadium.	i
Throughout the life of the school though, the Midshipmen have not necessarily needed movie stars or
radio entertainers to brighten their lives. The Service Center, “on Colfax just off Michigan” was always
ready and willing to give the Middie a very good head start, and from then on in he was on his own. The
Service Center is in itself a tribute to the warmth and friendship with which South Bend greeted and
treated every “Midshipman, USNR.”
Class eleven, we learned from informal chats with some of our officers, had the word. It had more
savvy and it seemed more “eager” than most of the previous classes. Other officers agreed, “Yes, eager—
to avoid as much work as possible.”
Officially the class convened on 12 July 1945. Those who were wise arrived only a few hours before the
deadline. Those who were too cautious arrived a day in advance and began their tour of duty at Notre
Dame with twenty-four hour watches.
The class was as young or younger than most. It consisted at the start of 1083 former V-12 students and

78 rated men. Although the majority of the class were engineers, they found the exams quite difficult. The
bilgees, just after mid-term exams, totalled approximately two hundred.
During the first week we cleaned our rooms and carefully preserved all gouges found for future reference.
We were issued copies of “Midshipmen’s Regulations”, which proved excellent insurance against demerits.
We were told where not to go, at what time not to be there, and what not to wear. To quote our instruction
sheet, “Keep your eyes and ears open, your mouth shut, move fast when you’re given an order, show a
proper respect for authority, and you’ll get along all right.”	’
The remainder of our first week was devoted to uniform fittings and dry runs to the classroom building.
Due to undetermined causes, there was also considerable head traffic at this time.
The routine of our class was somewhat less stringent than that of previous classes. We did not rise at
0545 for calisthenics, and the trainee-crippling capacity of the obstacle course had 1)660 greatly reduced.
The week of August 6th was indeed a hectic one. It began with two days of indoctrination exams,
involving the filling of thousands of blanks in such choice questions as: “The ______________■	; in.
lieu of '____________________, should be used rather than profanity.” The trees blossomed and bore a
bumper crop of bilgees.
That was also the week of our first “flying five” pay day. “Pick it up, walk to the end of the hall, and
divide it with mathematical precision between the representatives of our own Notre Dame button-bnstiug
indeterminate-period laundry and Max (“If it doesn’t fit, we won’t LET you wear it”) Adler.
But then on Friday there was the midterm dance and on Saturday the swearing-in ceremony, occurring
after the first midshipmen term had already begun.
Company officers harrassed us with conflicting orders and demands. “Remain in your billets until the
bell rings”; “fall out on regular parade more quickly.” These two particular orders gave birth to an elegant
compromise. Those on the second deck remained in their billets until the bell rang. Those on the third
and fourth decks lined the ladders three-abreast prior to the bell. In this ingenious manner was it possible
for all hands to fall in at almost the same instant. “What a killing they could make on demerits right now,”
remarked a cautious trainee. But the only unfortunate incident resulting from this procedure occurred
when a battalion officer precipitated a stampede by attempting to use the ladder just before a formation.
Returning to Notre Dame from our first Saturday night liberty, we observed men from the U.S.S.
Morrisey surreptitiously carrying packages. Further investigation revealed that these packages did not
contain liquid refreshment, but rather floor-wax, brass polish, and Bon-Ami. Ah, you chicken-hearted men
of Morrisey, whose fear of demerits overshadows full enjoyment of precious liberty time!.
Though quite occupied with our own problems, the newspapers and our own daily news bulletin gave

indication that great events were in the air. Would Japan capitulate? Then came the events that rocked
Japan and the world: The unopposed challenge of the U.S. Navy; the re-entry of Russia into the war
through her own back door; and the all-searing blast of the Atomic Bomb.
On the evening of 9 August 1945, those of us in Howard Hall listened to President Truman’s report on
Potsdam on our asthmatic P. A. system. It was an ordinary speech, delivered in a matter-of-fact way, not
intended to sway us by power of oratory. We stood in the passage-ways in various stages of undress and all
were quiet. But when it was over, we knew that we were partners with the rest of the world in this business
of Civilization, Inc.—or else.
We, along with the rest of the world, sweated it out. During study hour on Sunday, 12 August 1945, a
wild report swept throughout the regiment. There was a ten-minute recess. But it proved false. We
returned to our books and billets, but the old incentive was gone.
On Tuesday evening, 14 August 1945, some of us were returning from a YP-cruise. We slipped out of
the Michigan City station when the chief was looking the other way, and headed for the nearest bar. Here,
at 6:00 PM (C.W.T.) we heard the radio announcement. “Let’s have a round on the house, bartender,
it’s all over.”
From the train window we could see happy drivers with one hand on the wheel, the other on horn
button; farmers’ wagons trimmed with bunting; and costumed children waving flags. It took quite a while
to get our train through South Bend’s impromptu parades, but there was no liberty for us that night.
We, however, had at least passed through the celebration. Afthe school, we found many with cars to
radios, suffering the agony of being next-door-to but not part of what may prove to be the greatest celebra-
tion of the century.
Then in sober reflection, many of us realized how small a part we had played in the winning of the war
There were simple outdoor exercises for all hands the following morning. Captain Barry spoke briefly,
and though the news of two-day liberty was a pleasant surprise, he gave us no answer to the all-important
question,’ “Where do we go from here?” We shoved off for South Bend .with the exception of the luckless
midshipmen aboard the Wilmette, only to find all eating places and bars closed. Water, water, everywhere
nor any drop to drink proved literally true, from the sho.res of Lake Michigan to our own St. Joe’s. And as
to food, famished midshipmen artfully baited lines in attempts to obtain a dinner invitation from any con-
genial young lady at the service center.
Then, on Thursday evening, we went back to the books. “Let’s see now, flag hoist ------------------
means get underway—but for which destination, Providence, Rhode Island or the Entrance to
Tokyo Kaiwan? The latter will soon be well marked. Compare the range and destructive power of the
40 mm., the five-inch gun, and the atomic bomb. A very good question.”

Captain Barry addresses the midshipmen
on VJ-Day. The war was over at last.
Yes, the attitude had drastically changed. Before 14 August 1945, we were training for war. The more
we learned the better were our chances for success and survival. Now we were training only for the possi-
bility of another war.
Of what strange materials is scuttlebutt manufactured! The chairs set up in the drill hall for a seaman-
ship drill grew in number as the word was passed, until finally there were enough to seat the entire regiment,
which was to be told, of course, of its immediate en masse discharge.
Then Captain Barry gave us the word. Those who so desired could transfer to the regular Navy, the
others would be commissioned and be placed on inactive duty upon completion of the course at Notre Dame.
At the present moment there has been a considerable change in the plans for our future. We are to be
commissioned and report for active duty assignments. Premature letters to former employers were followed
by others in less gay a mood and college catalogues were regretfully reshelved. .
No history of the Navy at Notre Dame would be complete without mention of the first peace time
holiday observed after World War II, Labor Day, 1945. As many as ten men submitted shore leave re-
quests on the strength of one man’s letter of invitation, and battalion officers merrily signed away. As a test
case, one man attached a letter which read, “Please visit us on any weekend but that of Labor Day”. This
request was also approved. The war was truly over.
Two parts of this account are not yet complete. The decommissioning of the Midshipmen’s School and
the Naval careers of the men in this class. Little can be said at this time regarding decommissioning, but the
Midshipmen’s School facilities may be made available to the Naval R.O.T.C. Unit, which will continue on
at Notre Dame.
Although we now cannot fight for victory we can fight for world peace. Those of us who transfer to the
regular Navy will almost certainly have an opportunity to assist in maintaining world order, perhaps as
part of an international police force. Those of us in the Reserve may expect to help for a short time.
But more will be expected of an officer than leadership of men and knowledge of things naval. In a
world as interdependent as ours must be if it is to survive, the naval officer must have some knowledge of
current history, political science and economics. He must learn to recognize the causes of war and as a
clear-thinking citizen, join with others in constructive work for world peace. An understanding of the
mind and body of the world should make him better able to diagnose its ills and to assist, in his own small
way, in their eventual cure.	,
Although midshipmen will no longer double-time about the campus after November second, the Navy
will not actually leave Notre Dame. Present plans call for expansion of the R.O.T.C. and V-12 Units. Thus
Naval personnel will play an even larger part in the campus life of Notre Dame in the years to come.

Chief Anderman
Bandmaster.. •
The color, spark, and precision that transforms
a regiment of marching men into a sparkling mili-
tary outfit is generally provided by a marching
band. The Midshipman Band was on hand eleven
times a week at chow formations and at each re-
view and inspection to insure that spit and polish
appearance so desirable in Navy performances.
Veteran Bandmaster Chief Anderman, whose
listing of previous duty would fill a small biography,
was the organizer and director of the outfit. Under
his tutelage the musicians were molded into one
of the campus’ snappiest units. The drum major
of this semester’s band was W. R. Pavelchek.
During the first term, plans were discussed for a
full length band concert to be given perhaps in the
drill hall. However, with ultimatums concerning
Midshipmen futures appearing almost weekly, it
appeared doubtful that the talented bandsmen
would be able to put on their show. .

Fred Waring has his half a hundred Pennsyl-
vanians, but Notre Dame has its three score middies
who blend their voices to form the extremely popu-
lar glee club. The glee club: is one of the proudest
traditions on the Midshipmen campus for the choral
artists have long served as good will emissaries in
South Bend and vicinity. Through the mediums
of church services and radio programs, the Glee
Club has brought Notre Dame and South Bend in
closer proximity.
This semester the Glee Club sang in conjunction
with special services held on Sunday mornings at
the First Methodist, St. Paul’s Methodist, and the
First Baptist Churches.
Radio appearances during the latter part of the
semester were hopefully anticipated. However,
with the uncertainty of events from week to week,
it was doubtful whether such plans could .be carried
through. ?	.
The boys were accorded a big round of applause
for their singing, at the formal dance held on 21
September following the second hurdle, First term
exams.,	!	.
Twoappearancesonwhichthe whole group
trained its sights were the baccalaureate and gradu-
ation exercises, to be held during the final week
of festivities.' ■
The Glee Club’s advisor was Lieut. Mead, who
organized the group and arranged the singing
schedule. Midn. C. A. Gillespie was named di-
rector of the Glee Club and Midn. L. P. Hetlage
was appointed his assistant. The organist or ac-
companist, as the occasion demanded, was Midn.

.' ' Widely recognized to be an organization heavily
laden with talent was the Dance Band which was
organized and began to rehearse immediately after
indoctrination. Word got around early, via the
scuttlebutt route, that the Middie Dance Band was
something to hear, but it wasn’t ’tiLthe semester’s
half way point that the gifted music makers made
their first public appearance.	. .
After this first performance, which indicated that
advance notices were not just so much flattery, the
group seemed to thrive on work. Every other •
weekend found the boys beating it out down at the
. Service-Men’s Center to the delight of fellow Mid-
shipmen, not to mention their pretty hostesses.
Once a week the Dance Band provided a “dinner
concert” in the chow hall which performances
turned the place into a veritable “Palmer House”
for entertainment-hungry Midshipmen.
. The guiding light of the band’s fortunes was
Lieut. L. E. Dennis, who fulfilled the dual position
of conducting the band and playing the drums.
Under Lieut. Dennis’ direction a band within a
band, called appropriately the “Little Band”, was
formed.. This group included Lt. G. Bausewine;
Gordon, F. N.; Rohde, E. W.; Perkins, W. R.;
Hughes, C. W.J Gillespie; C. A.; Ritland, M. O.;
. and Lieut. Dennis. .	. •	'
< An appearance for which all members of the
band were training their sights was the Happy
Hour, the big event in the Navy schedule for each
class. However, due to the unsettled state of
affairs, the Happy Hour was just a temporary
billing and anything could happen in the inter-
vening weeks.

An “atomic bomb” ending to the 11th class’s
short stay at Notre Dame was supplied by the ever-
faithful bunch of dramatic enthusiasts. At last!
That inch of gold braid Admiral Meatball wore
no longer looked half-a-mile long. No more did
clothes make the man. In fact, on the stage of
“A Midshipman Night’s Dream,” clothes very
often unmade some men!
The two main characters, Eager and O. D.
Dope-off, had. very little to do, of course, except
act throughout the play. Not all the load was
theirs, however. Many other budding Thespians
murdered enough lines and stole enough scenes to
be adjudged guilty of acting by a court of________,
well, some >kind of court.
The.dance band joined the glee club in forming?
an integral part.of several scenes, besides helping the ’
stage men out-during the betwcen-scene changes? •

than when:.	. ■ •

“Softly As In the .Morning Sunrise”; “All Through
the Night,” and “The Night Is Young and You’re
So Beautiful,” sung by the glee club arid led by Lt.
Mead. .. The band, paced by Lt. (jg) Dennis, also
had several specialty numbers which included
“The Mole,” “Jump Town,” “Take the A Train,”
“I’ll Always Be In Love With You,” and “Benny’s

Of course, there were items that could have.. .

A casual shot during the height of the Ball.
And they came from everywhere. There were
“sea” men and “V” men. Some were civil engi-
neers; others were aerologists. Some wore white
socks; others wore black socks. Some wore their
hats on the back of their heads; others cocked theirs
over the right eye. But regardless of the -dis-
tinguishing features of each man, they were to be
poured into the proverbial melting pot, the ulti-
mate goal being to rid the men of any individualism
that might be present in their makeup.. ■
No sooner had we unpacked than we were called
to a meeting at which we were told that officers
were not needed. To amplify this statement, every-
one in ship’s company from the captain to the wave
seamen were incessantly reminding us that we had
better “get on da ball.” Other instructions advised
us to the effect that we should forget how to walk,
as everything was to be done on the double. But
this was only a part of the information that made
us realize that our life the next three months would
be far from that of peaches and cream.
The first day of class proved to be quite enlight-
ening, and it left many a shattered illusion in its
wake. The ponderous volumes .which neatly filled
the space between the top of the locker and the
ceiling were quickly relieved of their pressed flow-
ers; indoctrination was wending its torturous way.
The courses were really not difficult as a whole.
Different individuals were affected in different ways
which was manifested in the weekly “P-Works.”
For example, to some the Damage Control subject
was a very intangible one. Others found Seaman-
ship a great relief from the exacting sciences, since
everything could be ;said in five different ways.
Those who prior to their lucky day of enlistment
had experienced difficulty in directing a stranger
to the corner drugstore, discovered that Navigation
held for them the solution to their lifelong stigma.
But before the local staff of chiefs could backlash
us with their cat o’ nine tails, it seemed that our
v trial period was over with and that, like so many
rows of corn, we lined up before our skipper who
benignly surveyed' us as the seedlings, that would
someday blossom forth full grown. It was in the
ensuing moments that - the swearing in (swearing
being one of. the mdre popular pastimes in the
Navy-)- took placed We filed from the drill hall in
a blaze of glory. We were full fledged midshipmen
with the newly acquired .title of mister as an indi-
[ 206 ]
cation of the loftiness of our rank. However, our
“prestige” about the campus remained the same.
We were duly warned of the danger of taking
advantage of the new privileges accorded the lucky
ones who remained. As yet, I have heard of no
cases in which these new liberties were abused.
In fact we came into the first term barely noticing
a change. We were tough now arid could take it,
so we thought. But the instructors insisted on con-
gesting the matter and they were really surprised
to find that our mental capacity is proportional to
the amount imposed upon it. In short, we were
automatoms when the occasion would arise. This
would have pleased Washington no end had they
known about it.	.
Then like lightning struck the shocking news that
Japan had capitulated;. On the strength of this,
the whole station was given two (2) whole days of
freedom. Aside from the fact that everything in
town was closed and that lessons had to be done
in the meantime, the interlude was thoroughly
enjoyed by all from the commanding officer down
to the “diamond A’s.”	‘
The waning days of summer found our ranks
much more exclusive than when we first arrived.
Some didn’t see “eye to eye” with the Damage
Control department. Others did not have the
proper bite to become naval officers, whereas there
were still others who were fouled up when asked
to read the eye chart backwards. But, neverthe-
less, the “gob season” was just about over with and
we began to feel a sense of security that had here-
tofore been unheard of. This was manifested by
the fact that many did not finish unpacking until
after first semester exams were over.
With the advent of fall came football season
along with a ravishing contingent of beauties to
nearby St. Mary’s, both of which went to make our
weekends more enjoyable. But closure of the
service men’s center was a blow to us all, for many
had come to regard it as a weekend home. And
then there came the laborious process of buying
uniforms, but the competitive spirit of the local
clothing concerns went to make the ordeal more
interesting, at ANY RATE.
The last month was rather enjoyable, compara-
tively speaking, but we were glad when G-Day
was in sight, the big day on which we were made
officers and gentlemen by legislation.

“Now hear this, liberty has been declared!”
Thus ended another five and one-half days of toil,
and this began one and one-half days of unadulter-
ated freedom. These four magic words touched off
a mad scramble for the South Bend busses which
resembled cattle cars both in tonnage carried and
comfort. The midshipmen then descended on
South Bend like a thundering herd (the resemblence
to cattle did not stop at the busses), and spread out
over South Bend to seek their individual quarry.

The activities indulged in by the fun-seeking
middies were many and varied. Among the most

training were our cruises on Lake Michigan.
These will long be remembered for their good

.life, which was a, new experience to most of us.,
' Our first cruise-took us to . Chicago where we
embarked on a very sizeable vessel.' It seems that
many years ago, the pleasure liner EASTLAND
capsized in Chicago Harbor, carrying some'eight
. hundred passengers. to a watery grave. The hull
was salvaged, and turned over to the Navy. , Six
feet of concrete were placed in the hold, the super-
structure was remodeled so as. to resemble. that of
a fighting ship, and the re-christened .WILMETTE
was pressed into service as a training vessel. .
The object of this cruise was to apply the princi-
ples that we had learned in our academic work,
and the “Willie”, though far from being the essence
of modern naval power, served its. purpose well.
As the first section of our company piled up the
gangway, the aroma coming from twenty-five cent
cigars filled the air. It seems that the first com-
pany, had tried to teach some members of ship’s
company this “new” game called “blackjack” and
from all indications, it looked as if ship’s company

We felt the “Willie” surge under the terrific

whether the person in question was an idiot, a
moron, or some other facsimile. In arriving at a
. decision, this man did by no means debate with
himself in a mild tone of voice. The first company
to make the trip used cotton in their ears only when
firing the gun, and to the rest of the regiment, they
advised the use of cotton at all. times whether we
were receiving instructions or actually firing the
gun, due to the fact that the former created an
atmosphere equal in violence to the explosion of the
gun.
This instructor never seemed satisfied with our
efforts. When the sight setter was not making
errors in addition, the first loader was taking his
eye away from the breech, the latter being an
equally serious offense. However, when time came
to fire the guns, we found that we had developed
into a very proficient guncrew, that was due solely
to the efforts of our instructor. Though we were
bitter towards him at first, it became apparent that
only by such tactics as he used in handling us, could
we become well adapted to our jobs in the small
amount of time that was alloted this particular
activity. Our efforts were rewarded by getting
several hits on a microscopic target which was
placed at a considerable distance.
In addition to this siege of glory, we were “lucky”
enough to stand a few watches in the various and
sundry parts of the ship. One midshipman helms-
man who was having a very difficult time of keeping
the ship on its course, suggested to the midshipman

navigator of the
watch that
dead
in plotting
reckoning distances, he should use the formula
distance equals wave length times frequency instead
of the product of speed and time. It seems that the
Willie was leaving a perfect sine wave in its wake.
Then there was the Midshipman navigator who,
judging by his plot, was trying to convert the Willie
into an amphibious craft.
The chow was good, too. That is to say that the
creamed potatoes and Boston Baked Beans for
breakfast were very tasty; the hash browned pota-
toes and red beans for lunch had an excellent
flavor; and the baked potatoes and pork and beans
for dinner made an excellent combination.
A movie was the grand climax to each of oiir
three days at “sea”. Afterwards we retired to our
sacks which were dispersed throughout the various
parts of the ship. Some of us slung our hammocks
on the main deck above the boiler room for obvious
reasons, whereas others preferred the breezy atmos-
phere of the forecastle deck. Then there was the
midshipman who, after sleeping on his side in a
very loosely slung hammock, found it very difficult
to assume an upright position at reveille the next
morning.
Though glad to set foot on dry land at the end of
the day, we left Michigan City with a feeling of
confidence in our knowledge of handling ships, a
confidence that will be of great value in the days to
come.
An equally important element in our training
were the two days that were spent aboard Army
rescue boats and district patrol boats. The primary
purpose of these trips was to. indoctrinate the
middies into the art of boat handling and to give us
further instruction in Seamanship.


The sky was overcast as we raised our speed cones
to the yardarms emerging from the harbor, and
many a middie was petrified as they saw the white-
caps just beyond the breakwater. But ship’s com-
pany was well prepared for the occasion and green
looking midshipmen were methodically strapped
into life jackets as they were whisked back to the
fantail. But for those who took the tossing of the
seas, the afternoon was most eventful as we were
given almost complete charge of the boat. Ever so
often a boat would go astray from the formation,
but aside from that, the maneuvers went off with a
fair degree of smoothness. ‘

While off in a distant corner of the campus the
Notre Dame varsity scrimmaged back and forth,
all eyes focused on the summer football activities of
the midshipmen. Sparked by the influx of gridiron
greats from the major campuses of the country, the
midshipmen turned to under the watchful eyes of
their “diamond A”'overseers, and put'their all into
the desire to maim their shipmates, and uphold the
the United States Navy (Reserve). :
With a vigorous warm up of calesthenics pro-
ceeding each game, and topping the day off with a
sprint around the field, the physical training pro-
gram was more than enough to satisfy the whim of
any middie. Occasional tours of the tricky obstacle
course provided an outlet for any additional bursts
of energy that might have been present in the
individual’s makeup. In addition, it may be said
that the obstacle course served as a refreshing inter-
lude to the unending program of football and calis-
thenics.
Swimming comprised the other major outlet of
midshipman steam and we became proficient in
every stroke imaginable under the watchful guid-
ance of the “diamond A” who, incidentally, con-
vinced the people of South Bend that the “A” was

for aviation.-. Some of the strokes we learned were
the victory backstroke, which we laboriously prac-
ticed by the!hour, the breast stroke, the side stroke, •
and'the underwater breast stroke. Arid, to break .
the -monotony, every now arid theri. we played
Destroyers and Submarines which had a tendency
to liveri things up somewhat. Four laps, five laps,
the distance toll increasing each tirne until the final
. sprint to the; showers hardly made our pulses
; quicken.	' '
Extra'curricular’sports were the order of the day
for the “hardy” middies on their weekends, and
many and varied were the,past times they included.-
One of: the more glamorous activities was flying,
and many of us took the long trail to the airport for
lessons every weekend. Enticed by the vivid stories
of the devotees, we investigated the situation and
later, became a staunch supporter of this particular .
group. No casualties were reported. as we went: to ■
press and .many of our aggregation soloed before
leaving for parts unknown.	......
Golf was the other major weekend sport and the
participants included most of the unit’s officers
along with a large number of midshipmen and
members of ship’s company. The Notre Dame golf
course permitted the free, use of the course, and '
anyone who could beg, borrow, or steal a set of
clubs turned out—many of whom had never played
before. With V-J day, golf balls became easier to
get and the pleasant atmosphere of the rolling
course became the place to spend the weekend
afternoons.
On rainy afternoons we played volleyball and
basketball in Rockne Memorial, as many former .
college stars were intent on keeping their eye sharp
until their return to civilian life. Tennis was
another popular sport and the athletic office pro-
vided excellent equipment which was constantly
in demand. ‘
In spite of the very tight schedule that guided
our each and every minute, it may be said that the
midshipmen aptly demonstrated the American love
of sports, and in doing so, they kept themselves in
condition for future sea duty, whatever it was to be.

gives every Studebaker extra value
MOST of us have some special, personal reasons
for our preferences in motor cars. Yet there’s
nothing that has a greater bearing on any car’s
year ’round satisfaction than the quality of its
materials and workmanship.
Into every Studebaker goes the accumulated
skill of generations of home-loving, home-owning
craftsmen—fathers and sons working together
with the common purpose of producing cars
worthy of the finest reputation in the automotive
industry for surviving soundness.
Many have had the good fortune to enjoy Stu-
debaker operating economy through the war
years. Now, at last, the time is beginning when
the smart styling, the brilliant engineering, the
dependable long life and solid value of a new Stu-
debaker can be made available to more and more
of America’s forward-looking families. .

We are happy to have contributed to
Grumman’s outstanding production
records, but we take perhaps even a
greater pride in the fact that the in-
herent quality and design of Bendix*
Pneudraulic Shock Struts contribute
so importantly to the high performance
standards of Grumman and other lead-
ing plane manufacturers.

Design is being con-

meet ever increasing
impacts resulting from
added plane weights
and higher speeds.

wide range of sizes and
weights ranging
from less than
five pounds to
over 900 pounds.

The "built-in” precision of South
Bend Lathes, so evident in their per-
formance, has its source not only in
their design features, but in every vital
part. Each part has behind it the ex-
perience of nearly forty years of lathe
building, plus constant research directed
towards its improvement. Backing this
up in every manufacturing process are
rigid controls that prevent deviations
from established standards. These are
a
S O U T H BE N D

few of the reasons why South Bend
Lathes are better today in every way.
This "built-in” precision makes possi-
ble heavier cuts and feeds, easier opera-
tion, longer life, and greater accuracy.
It pays dividends to the users of these
lathes in better and faster machining.

ments in view of the advantages that

“Have a Coke”
It’s the
friendly
high-sign
There’s one American custom you run
into almost anywhere — the pause that
refreshes with ice-cold Coca-Cola. Have
a Coke is the same friendly invitation
in Costa Rica as in Connecticut. In many
lands around the globed Coca-Cola has
become a high-sign of friendliness—
just as it is in your own home..

of the November 1945, Class of the United
States Naval Reserve Midshipmen’s School
JT IS THE hope of Notre Dame that your, training period on
the campus has been as pleasant for you as has been the
entire relationship of the University and the Navy. These re-
lations extend, officially, back to the inauguration of the Naval
R.O.T.C. unit in September, 1941. Unofficially, they reach
back to the Christian concepts of our country's founding fathers,
’ which are so completely in accord with the spiritual, academic
■ and cultural objectives of the University. Notre Dame, with
your country and your Navy, is proud to share, in a modest
degree, the reflected credit of your participation in the- fight
to preserve these principles.	.
