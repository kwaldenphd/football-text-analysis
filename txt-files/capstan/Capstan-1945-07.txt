I
Dedicated in Memory
of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Late President of the United States of America
Commander-in-Chief of the United States Navy
• * * There are none of us who had not heard
those words, or felt their meaning.
On 12 April 1945 the world was brutally shocked by the
death of a champion of democracy and world hope, and of the
people everywhere. At Notre Dame, as all over the earth, a
sole physical reminder remained in the form of an Ensign flutter-
ing at half-mast. :
It was a far too infinite task then, as it is now, to eulogize the
person and the deeds of this truly great President. But he left
behind him a monument of ideals and world-philosophy which
will sing his praises for him. To we midshipmen and our gen-
eration, in whose hands will rest the future and the hopes of a
nation, these are an invaluable heritage. We will be ever grate-
ful and cherish them in our strivings for ultimate victory and for
that peace for which he so devoutly wished, and never lived to see.
To this man, who nurtured our Service and watched it grow,
and whose ideals in peace and war will ever be a standard and
a guide, we humbly dedicate this, the 8th CAPSTAN.
FOR ME, as your Commanding Officer, there
arrives the time to send a message of farewell
to you members of the Ninth and Tenth classes to
graduate from this Naval Reserve Midshipmen’s
School.
You will now join your brother officers in the
Navy, many of whom have gone forth from this
school, to fight against our remaining enemy, and
I am convinced that you, as those before you, will
do a good job. 1	. .
. , Recently we have witnessed the complete subju-
gation of our enemies in Europe. Even so, the
road ahead is shortened only by one-half and the
remaining road to ultimate victory will be neither
a smooth nor an easy one to travel. Another ag-
gressor who would deny, to mankind the Four
Freedoms for which democracy fights, is firmly en-
trenched in his lair in the Far East. He must be
"	' \	’ I -
sought out and destroyed, and it will become your
duty, as officers of the Navy, to contribute to this
effort.
At this school, I think you have learned that the
Navy is exacting in its standards, and high in its
ideals. I have every confidence that you will up-
hold these standards and ideals, and that the final
report on your efforts will be “WELL DONE”.
In bidding you farewell, to each and every one
of you I say, “Good luck and happy landing.”
, W ELCOME to the Wardroom !
To you graduates of classes Nine and Ten, the Navy presents an
exciting future. Not too long after' you join the fleet, the remainder
of the Jap Navy will be forced to fight a decisive battle. The outcome—
victory for the Allied Fleet is a foregone conclusion.	’
But time for you individually to prepare for battle is short. Be dili-
gent to adopt the knowledge gained at Notre Dame to the practical
needs of the fighting forces.
We of the shore bound Navy are confident that you will justify
your training.	.	-
Good Hunting!

TECHNICALLY, Navigation is the art of sailing
the seas by the use of sextants, tables, charts,
plotting gear and heavenly bodies. To the Mid-
shipman, however, it is further defined with daily
quickies, P-works and frequent journeys to the
academic forest.
Stressed as it was in the Midshipman course,
Navigation became an everyday proposition and its
many texts and tables were a constant reminder of
how much there was to know and how little we were
getting. Facts and fancy both played a part—facts
in Dutton and Bowditch and fancy in three dimen-.
sions on a two-dimensional blackboard. More than
once a Midshipman or two were caught proverbially
banging their heads against a bulkhead in vain
attempts to visualize the factors of two coordinate
systems on a celestial sphere. It was easy enough
with the coordinator and once or twice we even
understood without it.
Piloting was more fun in a way. There, at least,
you could see where and how you were going.
Fortunately for some of us, a good soap eraser and a
few new strokes with a 2H were all that was necessary
to rectify any error in calculating courses and
distances. Whenever Hens-and-Chickens loomed
too close, a slight twist of the straight edge put us
in safe water.
Every now and then we had to stop and figure the
current and tide for our locality. All this was fairly
easy but as Midshipmen navigators we had other
subjects to take care of, too, and every one of them
required some of the time we should have used to
really understand Navigation. . It soon became
apparent that 'those Monday afternoon P-works
were really a weekly race with time.
Except for the enormous library required, celestial
navigation wasn’t too tough. If only someone had
condensed H.O. 214, 211, N.A., A.A. into a handy
pocket edition, we could have looked forward to the
daily Plan I operation with lighter hearts.
The superficial knowledge we gathered concern-
ing navigation-at-sea may have resulted from many
headaches but we all stand agreed that it will be a
mighty gratifying reserve when the stalwart young
men of Classes 9 and 10 take up their positions with
the fleet.

THE first Neanderthal who picked up a rock' and
tossed it at the fellow who stole his favorite wife
never dreamed he would cause a thousand Mid-
shipmen so many headaches during the ’ period
February-July 1945. His primitive weapon is
certainly a far cry from the projectile of a modern
16-inch gun but it is much to blame for the numerous
troubles encountered in Ordnance class. .
During the first weeks of indoctrination the
history of that first missile caused some Midshipmen.
a good laugh, but it was not very long before the
same men wished they were back in the glacial ages
with nothing more to worry about than the problems
involved in developing a good throwing arm. For
before they could finish making that wish they
found themselves knee-deep in what seemed an
interminable number of projectile types, powders,
and their myriad uses.
In the month that followed Midshipmen found a
formidable as well as an interesting challenge in
Ordnance. Though at first many thanked their
stars that the accelerated course could include only
the bare fundamentals, they were even more grateful
later when they found good use for the solid founda-
tion that had been laid for them. Artists, architects,
journalists, musicians, became as well acquainted
with the largest and smallest naval guns as the
fleetmen in their midst. Certainly some were
dropped by the way/ide while" others skimmed
through with a dozen lucky tokens in their pockets,
but the great majority began to get an inkling of the
tremendous work involved in planning and adapting
such a course to wartime standards. They began to
see the experience and foresight as gathered by
American military genius and applied for their
guidance. Through appreciation of x this they
gained a greater sense of application which prepared
them for the even more intensive second term.
. Perhaps at the end, when graduation finally
became a reality, the new Ensigns were not anywhere
close to being schematic wizards but with deter-
mination and new initiative they were ready for the
job at hand.	'.	.

OIGNAL IN THE AIR!”
A maze of corpens, turns, forms, pennants and
speed flags were brought into play and with them the
guide’s instructions were relayed from ship to ship
in the little YP fleet on Lake Michigan. This was
our Seamanship course put to a practical test—a
time when our greatest concern was to interpret
quickly and correctly in order to eliminate the risks
of collision. Undoubtedly, many of our future
decisions will be gauged by whatever experience we
picked up from these cruises.
Back in the’classroom, the main objective took the
form of P-works and quickies. One week’s work
merged with the next and a constant application of
shipboard terminology, codes and signals finally
gave us a composite picture of what Naval life must
be like for the Ensign.
First and foremost are the duties of an O.O.D:
Only in the Navy is a young officer given an oppor-
tunity in such a responsible position. Here at Mid-
shipmen’s School in four short months a fellow must
reap enough material to enable him to take his
place beside experienced men of. the sea. Knowledge
is part of it—a great part of it—but there are five
. other requisite qualities that define a top-notch
O.O.D. And these five are not to be had through
tests and teachers but through the experiences and
circumstances to come . . . Quick, wise decisions—
that is our goal.
Furthermore,1 it is essential that an officer be
acquainted with the history, traditions, and future
of the Navy. This also was a part of our Seamanship
course—a small but significant part. We learned of
the colorful past and of the broadening future—the
future in which we would belong. To some it
became a challenge; to others it was just another
part of a grueling course at Midshipmen’s School.
Rules of the Road, small-boat handling and
weather studies were all an inspiration to amateur
yachtsmen waiting for the day when they could put
to sea in private boats and apply all this knowledge
in a leisurely sort of way.
These and others parts of Seamanship added to
our confidence and. doubled our eagerness for
graduation and sea duty. Four months ago we
were called “green boots’-’ and that we were—but 1
now, mind you, now we have learned and we go
forth from Notre Dame Midshipmen’s School with
our chins high and our eyes searching the future’s
horizon for glory, opportunity and honor.

I understand, this is his Fiftieth Mission—-to the Fantail!

“Gentlemen,” said the ensign, “Damage Control
boils down to a mere matter of keeping your vessel
afloat so that the guns may continue to fire at the
enemy.”
Those were the words that’greeted us when we
entered our first Damage Control class. Since none
of us had any idea of the subject beforehand these
words did much to stem our fears of this unknown.
That was before we ran into terms of such unfamiliar
and foreboding meaning as “stability”, “pressure
compounding”, “curves of form”, and the host of
others that were to plague us through our cruise at
Notre Dame.
During indoctrination, that period of storm before
the storm in every Midshipman’s life, D.C., as we
had grown to call it, held no particular terrors.. All.
you had to do was know how to build a steam turbine .
. and qualify as chief motor machinist’s mate on
diesels and you could be sure of hitting the P-work
for a passing grade. Many of us wondered why these
“fundamentals” were taught us when, as we had
been told, damage control was the science of keep-
ing the vessel afloat.. The majority still wondered
months later when these matters were only “sure
points” on the final and we longed for the days
when you could do a damage control assignment
without a slide rule and a master’s degree in science.
'Stability was the new Goliath to be met and van-
quished before we could be stamped as a finished
product on the ensign factory’s assembly line. Armed
with slide rule we plunged into the task ahead. Dur-
ing the hard weeks that followed all the ramifications
of stability unfolded before us in flooding effect dia-
grams, booklets of . inclining experiment data, and
action reports that grew to haunt and plague all Mid-
shipmen who had previously thought damage was to
be rectified by the liberal use of a hammer and nails.
Counterflooding was next. Shoring followed and
here we learned how to reinforce weakened bulk-
heads and add strength to our damaged vessel. So
continued our damage control course with an, end-
less assortment of new and difficult variations to be
mastered. But eventually came finals and to our
own surprise we scraped through. Those mysterious
subjects that had seemed so ominous four short
months before were now only another potential bilge
, that had been successfully sidestepped.
The two hours a week we spent at damage control
drills constituted one of the most interesting side-
lights of the entire course. Movies for the most part
—their interest may be attested to by the fact that
no Midshipman (and Midshipmen are artists at it)
ever griped when the drill schedule showed a trip to
Washington Hall. Other drills took place in and
about the Navy Drill Hall, or the “Green Barn” as
we were prone to call it.
The gas mask drill was remembered by many for
some time afterwards by red-rimmed eyes and a gen-
eral sneezing tendency that we couldn’t control. We
were issued masks, told how to use them, and went
through putting them on and taking them off so that
no one could go wropg when the time came. On
being led into the gas chamber we quickly discovered
that when the straps on the gas mask were tightened,
according to instructions, the acute discomfort that '
comes with inhalation of a good whiff of tear gas
was not as apparent. One mistake proved to us that
a more careful check would evidence better results
I the next time we donned the masks. .
The gas mask drill was one of the more realistic
drills, but in them all we had an opportunity to put
classroom theory .to actual practice and found that
what we had been studying really worked.
Looking back, it may be said that damage control
came to most of us with difficulty; to a few with case.
Drills, lectures and P-works kept each and all on the
jump, however, and caused many a headache to dim
the vision of gold bars.

When the muster bell starts chiming, middies all start
double-timing
And they fly with frantic frenzy for the door.
But in silence, naught is spoken save for damn! when bones
are broken

the floor
And though dying, no one dares to question, what they’re
sprinting for.
But I swear that once I leave here I will never run no more!
Double timing I abhor.
When once you get braided, Your spirits, now faded

And soon simple seamen will think you a demon

With blood a good game ripples
As it cripples,
Kills and maims.

Is my head a mere stone or just worked to the bone?

But I’m straining in vain ’cause my overworked brain

But when the day is searing, then we know we’ll soon be

Midshipman, U.S.N.R..
Drum Major
Despite the omnipresent pressure of academics and
military duties a sorely needed Marching Band was
organized. In truth, a Regimental Band just had
to be. So, utilizing every available scrap of time,
Chief Musician Lloyd Anderman developed some
forty midshipmen into an excellent contingent of
musicians.
j	The Marching Band was always present when it
r .	', was needed. The task at hand was seeing that some
thousand left feet hit the deck simultaneously whether
marching to mess or “Passing in Review”. Let it
be said that this .task was performed remarkably well.
Chief Anderman, an old hand at organizing and
directing Navy bands, is the man responsible for the
excellent, performance of the band. The Chief was
:	once a member of the crew of the USS Yorktown,
.• “The Fighting Lady”.
Unlike the other midshipmen organizations, the
. Band did, not; make off-station appearances; how-
ever, its Notre Dame career was climaxed by a

The Glee Club, composed of sixty Midshipmen and
under the able direction, of Ensign E. L. Dahlstrom
and later Lt. (jg) W. R. Mead, was the most active
organization on the station. The sacrifice of a large
portion of their limited free time was not in vain,
for the results of their efforts were enjoyed and ap-
preciated not only by fellow Midshipmen but also
by the many townspeople who attended their special
programs and heard their broadcasts.
Specializing in neither secular nor ecclesiastical
music, the glee club developed a varied repertoire
suitable for many occasions. As a choir, they sang
at the'Easter morning sunrise service of the First
Presbyterian Church and made later appearances at
the Sunnyside Presbyterian Church, the First Meth-
odist Church, and the St. Paul’s Methodist Church.
On hand at the Navy Drill Hall on 15 April they
lent a fitting musical note to the . solemn memorial
service honoring our late president and Commander-
in-Chief, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Broadcasts from the studios of WSBT and special
selections for the Happy Hour featured an octet
composed of T. E. Brenner, H. C. Davis, R. F.
Doolittle, H. W. Eloe, W. Petlow, J. Howerton,
R. E. Hughes, and R. L. Sittig.

After diligently devoting three evenings a week to
rehearsing, the cosmopolitan group which makes up
the Midshipmen Dance Band opened at the Service
men’s Center on May 27. The appearance was re-
ceived with such a rousing ovation that frequent re-
' appearances were demanded by the patrons of the
“Center.”
In addition to its off-station “jobs” the band was
on hand for the Happy Hours and other Navy
shows to lend a rhythmic note to the evening’s
entertainment.
The band was under the able direction of Lt. (jg)
“Scoop” Dennis of the Seamanship department who
also doubled on the drums. Another outstanding
member of the rhythmic section was the pianist,
Lt. (jg) Bausewine, who was aboard the USS Helena
when she went down in the Kula Gulf. Midshipman
L. F. Maurer, who strums the guitar, was with the
Seabees who landed on Guam during the early stage
of the battle. Trombonist L. A. Reist, formerly a
Musician First Class, served aboard Men of War
during several major engagements. These and
others from flat-tops, cruisers, and widely scattered
Naval units both afloat and ashore gave willingly of
their free time to form and perfect a dance band
which will be long remembered by their fellow
Midshipmen.

“Gzn. Eisenhower has announced the cessation of
organized resistance in Europe. A thrilled and
grateful nation is justifiably proud of all who made
this accomplishment possible.
But this was total war—a global war. We are but
half way to complete victory. There remains to be
conquered the entire Japanese nation. Men are
still fighting and still dying and will continue to
fight and die in. the hard push to Tokyo.
The casualty lists tell the story, tragic yet glorious,
of the fighting men’s will to win unconditional •
victory no matter what the cost. We have a solemn
compact with these men. The road that lies ahead
demands from each of us a matching determination
and unity of effort that will shorten the time during
which such sacrifices must continue.
Today every man and woman in any uniform, and
every worker on the home front should rededicate
himself or herself to the task of providing all the fire
power that is needed to smash the remaining enemy.
To delay now in celebration of past successes would
be fatal to carefully laid plans. We cannot—and
must not—pause in discharge of our duties so long
as a Jap remains a threat to the life of a single soldier
or sailor.
Let each one of us get on with our job?’

Bob Hope knew he wanted to be a comedian from
the day his voice changed. It is probably the only
case on record of a man being stirred to comical
aspirations by the biological phenomenon of a voice
changing. And therein lies a story.
Possessed of a fine soprano voice when a child,
Bob, encouraged by his mother who was Agnes
Townes Hope, a star of the English operetta stage,,
flaunted the tony pipes for all Cleveland to hear at ;
home-made musicales. And on the momentous day
of which we speak, young Bob’s relatives were all
assembled in the house in Cleveland waiting for the
youthful vocalist to sing “The End of a Perfect Day.”
And he did, but somewhere in the middle of the not
too perfect “Perfect Day” his voice cracked.
Valiantly he finished the number, partly in
soprano, partly in tenor, entirely in laughter. It was
young Hope’s most successful rendition, judged from
the standpoint of pure entertainment. . And it did
something to Bob he will never forget. The sight of
all his relatives laughing at one and the same time
made him realize how wonderful a thing laughter
was. And he resolved to make mirth his life’s work.
Broadcasting the Pepsodent Variety Show from
Washington Hall on Tuesday evening, 29 May, was
in itself a big event for the Midshipmen’s School.
But the real importance of the day lay in the fact that
it was Bob Hope’s birthday. The occasion was
marked somewhere in the middle of the broadcast
by the swift exchange of a birthday cake, which
found its mark among the Midshipmen in the first
few rows of the hall.
. • .The show itself was a big hit. At times, Bob had
trouble with the sound effects but it all added to the
fun and laughter which characterized the whole
evening. During the regular broadcast, a special
off-the-script visit was paid by singer Bing Crosby,
who was ushered aboard with the Captain’s party.
Two or. three numbers, including our favorite Irish
. Lullaby, hushed the house for a few moments and
then the regular show was resumed. Among the
highlights were “Everytime” with Skinnay Ennis
and orchestra and “I Should Care” sung by Frances
Langford.

LET’S read what they said about
* this amazing new personnel and
cargo carrier in a Philippines dispatch
to “Yank,” the U. S. Army weekly.
Here’s the quotation:
“The Weasel is still getting to the
front in this tough sector after every
other type of vehicle has bogged
down in the rice paddies and swamps
1 ... To the infantrymen stretching one
day’s rations to three, the sight of
these little jobs, churning through
the bog past swamped trucks, is a
fine and heart-warming spectacle.”
Designed by Studebaker engineers
and built in the Studebaker factories,
the Weasel finds footing on all kinds
of terrain—sand, snow, mud, swamp
or solid ground. It clambers up and
down steep, slippery banks and
takes to deep water like a boat, pro-
pelled .from shore to shore by.the
movement of its flexible, rubber-
padded tracks.
Power plant of the Weasel is the
brilliantly responsive 6-cylinder en-
gine of the remarkably economical
Studebaker Champion motor car.
Studebaker is proud to add the ver-
satile Weasel to its list of war equip-
ment for our valiant fighting forces.

Whether it is the deck of a flat-top or a front line jungle clearing, the
Navy's new Grumman "Hellcat" fighter plane can land safely because
of Bendix-Pneudraulic Struts. These precision-built "land legs" com-
bine maximum strength with light weight. They (not the plane) take
the shock of the first contact of the wheels with the ground. Their .
hydraulic cylinders cushion the impact and help to make the "Hell-
cat" one of the "sweetest planes to handle" the Navy airmen have had.
Bendix* Landing Gear is outstanding for its rugged strength, pre-
cision and simplicity which makes its advantages readily available to
all types of aircraft.

Keeping the "Clippers” fit and mechanically perfect for flying is a job that
demands precision maintenance. At many of Pan American World Airways’
bases, South Bend Precision Lathes are used to service instruments, make
replacement parts, and machine a variety of work to original factory toler-
ances. Pan American, along with many other airlines, has found that South
Bend Lathes give them the dependable, accurate performance that is required
for the exacting service functions demanded in their base shops. ,

JT IS THE hope of Notre Dame that your training period on
the campus has been as pleasant for you as has been the
entire relationship of the University and the Navy. These re-
lations extend, officially, back to the inauguration of the Naval
R.O.T.C. unit in September, 1941. Unofficially, they reach
back to the Christian concepts of our country's founding fathers,
■which are so completely in accord with the spiritual, academic
and cultural objectives of the University.- Notre Dame, with
your country and your Navy, is proud to share, in a modest
degree, the reflected credit of your participation in the fight
to preserve these principles.
