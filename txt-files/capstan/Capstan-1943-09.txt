. we dedicate this book to
Commander Howard W. Gilmore
[2] .
“For distinguished gallantry and valor above and beyond the call of
duty as commanding officer of a United States submarine during her
fourth war patrol in the Southwest Pacific. Boldly striking at the enemy,
Commander Gilmore sank one Japanese freighter and damaged another
by torpedo fire. In the darkness of night an enemy Japanese gunboat
- close ranged and prepared to ram the submarine. Commander Gilmore
daringly maneuvered to avoid the crash and rammed the attacker instead,
ripping into her port side at 17 knots and bursting wide her plates. In •
the terrific fire of the sinking gunboat and heavy machine gun fire, Com-
mander Gilmore calmly gave the order to clear the bridge, and refusing .
safety for himself, remained on deck while'his men preceded him below. _
. Struck down by the fussilade of bullets and having, done his utmost
against the enemy in his final moments, Commander Gilmore gave his
. last order to the officer of the deck, ‘ Take her down! ’. The submarine
dived; damaged but under control she was brought safely to port by her
well-trained crew inspired by the courageous fighting spirit of their dead :
captain.”
our commanding officer
The Third Midshipmen’s Class at Notre Dame, like its two predecessors, has been fortunate in
having as its Commanding Officer a man whose long and varied Navy experience makes him a
capable and understanding leader of men.
Since 1915, when he was graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Captain
Henry P. Burnett has seen service on many ships in many waters. During World War I he was a
Communications Officer aboard the Pennsylvania. 'At various times between 1923 and 1930 he was
in the submarine service; in 1925, as a Lieutenant Commander, he was with a destroyer force in the
Pacific; in 1927 he was a member of the United States Naval Mission in Lima, Peru.
These years of varied duty, of handling men in a hundred different situations both dangerous and
difficult, have given him the tact and the firmness which, are necessary for the delicate task of trans-
forming civilians into naval officers in four short months. The discipline which he imposes has always
been strict, yet temperate; never deviating into slackness on the one hand or tyranny on the other.
During his long and honorable naval career Captain Burnett has done many praiseworthy things
in the service of his country; but far from the least of his contributions are the many young men whom
he has given such an excellent start in the Navy at a time when the need for these men is so great.

. “You will always have to fight to preserve what
-you will have won. You who are now offering
your lives for your country must live for your
country. You must have a voice in determining
the future, in shaping a peace that will be perma-
nent because it will be based upon charity and
justice.”
Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C.
President of the University of Notre Dame
[8]
a menace from . . . .
It is an honor and a great satisfaction to me as your Commanding Officer to send greetings and
salutations to the members of the Third Class to be graduated from the United States Naval Reserve
Midshipmen’s School as you are about to leave Notre Dame to assume your duties with the naval
forces of the United States. You are going out to the aid of our beloved country in its hour of trial
and greatest need. You cannot and you will not fail. .
Glorious in the past, never more glorious than in the present, the Navy welcomes you with open
heart; and it places its future largely in the hands of new officers like you, in full confidence that you
will surely cherish its traditions and its shining history of valorous service.
The best of luck, and may God’s blessing»go with you.	.	.
H. P. BURNETT,
Captain, U. S. Navy, Commanding
The following is an extract from an address given by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, U. S. N., Com-
mander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, to a group of newly commissioned officers: '	.
“Many of you . will be called to service at once—some of you in very remote parts of the
world. Always remember'that in accepting this commission, in taking your oath of office,
you are undertaking to carry a share of the weight of responsibility in the defense of this
. great and beloved country of ours. You may serve on battleship or torpedo boat; submarine
or plane; you may serve in any sea. You may be called on to.carry on an exacting routine,
or circumstances may offer you the opportunity to.perform some brilliant exploit that will .
make you a noted part of American naval tradition. No one can tell, today, how great a
privilege to serve your counrty it may later appear, that you are granted. But always re-
. member that as an officer of the Navy, your commission is merely the chance to serve. It ■
is the beginning of a more serious responsibility; a grave duty; a heavy obligation.” •
. I am confident that the purpose of your training here has been fulfilled and that as you receive
your commissions you are fit to echo a phrase famous in our Navy, “Sir, we are ready now.”
M. D. FAIRCHILD
Lieutenant Commander, U. S. N. (Ret.)
[9]
The Third Notre Dame Midshipmen Class has been fortunate in
having such a man as Lieutenant Commander Milton D. Fairchild as
their Executive Officer. Active duty with the Fleet, experience on the
staff of the U. S. Naval Academy, a genuine love of the Navy, combined
with his determination to have us the best officers afloat, amply qualify .
him for his position on this station.
Since his graduation from the U. S. Naval Academy in 1930, our..
Commander has served on many types of men-of-war. The bombing of
the destroyer KANE, while evacuating American Nationals from Spain
in 1936, gave him the unusual experience of war-in peacetime. Com-
mander Fairchild came to us directly from California where he had
served as administrative head of the Navy’s Diesel Training School.
Discipline when administered justly creates respect and admiration.
Those of us who have , had the chance to know and talk with our Com-
mander can attest to his sincere interest in our problems and willingness
to stand by us. In spite of his many duties we always felt welcome in
his home or office.

la
To begin with the beginning, as Dickens once
■ wrote, I 'was born. To begin in the middle and
. work towards the end, I was once a Midshipman,
an officer in a qualified sense.
My name is of little importance because there
were so many of us in our Company. You would
probably forget initials so I’ll give you my laundry
number, and let that do until the BuPers decides
in my favor and gives me a serial number that I
■ can print in the upper left hand corner of all my
future correspondence.
The Notre Dame Laundry Inc. alloted me No.
6384 as means'of identifying my skivvy shirts and
khaki trousers for three and one half months, so
for the sake of clarity and brevity that will be my
call number throughout “My Day’s Log”.
The day that I have entered could be anyone of
the 115 days that I have spent on board learning
how to become a naval officer in a qualified sense.
So after consulting the Nautical Almanac and
Plate II, I am taking the alegratic sum and the
mean draft and picking July 17, 1943, as the day I
will enter in the rough log. But while reading
over my entries keep in mind the routine was the
same for every day, perhaps on this particular day
the assignment in Seamanship was a little harder,
maybe ‘ I was feeling. pretty low after my last
Typhoid shot, or I had just been informed that I
made the tree. Nevertheless, I still contend all of
the days were basically the same—if it wasn’t one
thing it was another. And after reading through
the daily routine maybe you could answer the big-
gest question that has been on my mind ever since
I arrived at Notre Dame, May 31, 1943. “If all
of this is done in the name of an officer in a quali-
fied sense—what in the name of blazes will be ex-
pected of me when I’m a “regular”?
Mid Watch 0000-0400
0130—Awakened by an energetic soul with a
black and yellow band wrapped around his arm.
Half asleep I scribbled my
initials on the small paper
he was carrying.
0157—Started up to the
second deck of Morrissey,
still wondering if maybe I
hadn’t been a little too
eager to join the Navy in
the first place.
0159—Greeted the Security Watch with a snappy
“Ready to relieve you, sir”. Logged myself in,
and as. he rounded the corner to
bed, sank down in a hard chair and
tried to make myself comfortable.

Ordnance
ORDNANCE, the science of blowing up your
fellow man before he blows you up, was a
subject profoundly interesting to Midshipmen. It
is impossible not to take any interest in a 16-inch
gun, when you know that in a few short months
you may be looking into the muzzle of one, pointed
• at your Higgings boat with-unfriendly intentions
and malice aforethought. Midshipmen therefore
resolved-to master this fascinating science, so that
they could hold up their end of the little game of
TNT tag which Webster calls war.
The course opened with a study of explosives.
The instructor went over the ingredients of the
various types with as much unction as though, he
were describing his wife’s favorite cake recipe, and
told how many city blocks' an ounce or two of
such-and-such an explosive would wipe out. Then,
perhaps, he would fish a cylindrical chunk of
smokeless powder out of his pocket, saying that
:his particular grain was very old and had long
ago lost its volatiles, and was very unstable: at
vvhich point he would begin to toss the chunk of
aowder around in a very frivolous fashion, bang-
ing it against the desk or perhaps dropping it on
the. floor; while the innocent seamen (This was
' during Indoctrination) would stuff their fingers
■ in their ears, grit their teeth, and while awaiting
the inevitable explosion, wonder whether there'
would be enough pieces of them left for burial,
and wish that they had kissed their girls just once
more before they left home. Then the instructor
would tell them about a friend of his who was
always fooling around with some explosive or
other and would get his head blown off if he was
not more careful. And then, after hitting the
powder a final bang on the desk, he would hand
it to the seamen and tell them to pass it around
and look at it; which they did, handling it as
though it were red hot.
During the first Midshipmen 'term, Ordnance
dealt with the construction and operation of guns,
and some very complicated mechanisms were
thrown at the suffering students. They learned
that every gun has an amazing number of parts
. in it, each of which has a name; and that, as a
general rule, the smaller a part is, the longer
its name is. Instructors loved to talk about a
little chunk of metal found in one of the guns:
this little piece of steel is approximately an inch
long, arid has a completely incomprehensible narne
with seven or eight parts to it.
After absorbing such items as radial expansion,
A-tubes, frictionless bearings, gas check systems,
differential cylinders, and firing locks, Midship-
men went on, in the second term, to the study of
aiming the gun. This, they found is not merely a
matter of squinting through a'sight and squeezing
the trigger; it involves several complicated mech-
anisms; so complicated that the complicated
mechanisms of the first term seemed sirriple in com-
parison and Midshipmen after a discouraging scs- .
sion with the G. E. director found themselves yearn-
ing. for the good old days when all they had to
worry about was the DeBange Gas Check System.
They were told that nowadays range and de-
flection problems were solved automatically by
machines; but before they had a chance to re-
joice, they were also told that, in order that they
might appreciate just what these machines were
doing for them, they would be given a few problems
to work out by hand.
NOT EVEN The Commando Course contribu-
ted as much to the physical development of
Midshipmen as did Navigation. After four months
of carrying Bowditch, Dutton, charts, plotting
gear, tide tables, current, tables, nautical almanac,
and HO 214. around under his left arm, the puniest
of Midshipmen found that he had developed
phenomenal biceps. Bowditch in particular was
so crammed with weighty wisdom, that a crowbar
was required to pry him up off the deck after some
exhausted sufferer had dropped him there.
At first, many Midshipmen attempted to solve
the problem by leaving Bowditch in their billets
when they went to class;but they soon discovered
their mistake, and ever afterwards .voiced heart-
, felt agreement with that fourth-deck Confucious,
who first uttered the golden words, “Bowditch
weighs less than a rifle.”
The mental labor undergone in Navigation class
was just as great as the physical labor which was
required in order to get there. Midshipmen were
sadly disillusioned. They learned that a compass
needle doesn’t point North after all; that the North
Star is not always located directly above the North
Pole; that when you look at your watch and see
What time it is, it isn’t that time at all, it is several
thousand simultaneous different times, each of
them labelled with a different set of letters and
figured widely differing but equally complicated
ways. Finally, they learned that when you think
you have made a 4.0 on P-Work, you have actually
.made a 1.9; but when you think you have made
1.9, you are right.
The compass, that crazy instrument that is
wrong two ways at once, was perhaps the principal
headache. After struggling for an hour or two
with the P.S.C., deviation, variation, magnetic,
and true, despairing Midshipmen wondered why
they couldn’t throw all the calculations overboard
and just muddle through, the way Columbus did.
Little sayings and songs, such as “Can Dead Men
Vote Twice” and that lovely little ditty, “From
Compass to Course, Magnetic to Gain”, were
provided by helpful instructors, so that their stu-
dents could remember which correction corrected
what error, and how it did it. Midshipmen learned
the lyrics by heart, but could never figure out
what they meant, or else got them a little twisted,
J\avi^ation
as “Can Two Dead Men Depart by Course Al-
lotted?”.
Most of the Navigation lessons involved plotting
the course of some hypothetical ship whose captain
had an insane passion for zig-zagging and for get-
ting his ship into dangerous waters. This captain
would steam along, zig-zagging happily, with
nothing ahead .of him except open water, one
hundred fathoms deep; but alt at once he would
look to starboard and see three minefields and
two reefs, with a terrific rip-tide running amongst
them. Chuckling with glee he would change
course to starboard at once and head straight for
the obstacles, and then sink back in the hypothe-
tical easychair on his hypothetical bridge and
relax, while a roomful of sweating Midshipmen
figured out his E. P.’s and danger bearings for
him.. After a lengthy session of vainly trying to
find the danger angle of a mine field, most Mid-
shipmen discovered that they were in complete
sympathy with that famous old Navy phrase
(uttered, perhaps, under similar circumstances,)
“Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!”
(Seaman^nip
UPON the Seamanship Department fell the un-
enviable task of hammering into civilian heads
all the useful pieces of sailorly information which
were not covered by the other departments.
Early in the course came a long list of definitions
from the Bluejacket’s Manual—definitions of those
outlandish terms which sailors use when they don’t
want anyone to know what they are talking about:
“scuppers”, “cat pendant”, “partners”, etc., etc.
These definitions played a part in P-works, of
course. On one memorable, occasion the following
question appeared: “Where would you expect to
find a jackass aboard ship?” It is impossible to
calculate how many midshipmen there were who
(not knowing that a jackass is a canvas plug stuffed
with oakum and used to prevent water from com-
ing in through the hawse pipes—not even knowing
as a matter of fact, what “oakum” and “hawse
pipes” were) who were faced with the horrible
temptation of answering, “on the bridge”, or, “in
the wardroom”. Apparently they all resisted the
temptation; nobody was shot the next morning.
But there were many other blunders, innocent
ones, to keep the instructors in a good humor. One
valiant guesser, when asked what a “spar sus-
pended horizontally from the mast was” answered,
“A Flag Officer”. Then there was the midship-
man who was asked, “Who is The Chief of Naval
Operations?” The poor devil, who had probably
been thoroughly lectured on some previous
occasion for failure to “sound off” when answer-
ing a question, was very careful to “sound off”
this time. A little too careful, in fact: he sprang
to attention and said, “Admiral King, sir, Mid-
shipman Smith”.
Midshipmen were also made acquainted with
the Organization of the Navy and the Chain of
Command; they spent much time speculating on
hypothetical cases, as when an Ensign runs a
landing barge up on a mud bank and is bawled
out by his immediate superior, and so on up the
ladder, until the whole affair ends with the Presi-
dent telling the Secretary of the Navy to be a little
more careful next time.
It was at this point that they learned of their
own humble position in the Naval Organization,
and first heard that dubious phrase, “Officers in a
qualified sense”.
Communications, visual and radio, made up a
large portion of the Seamanship curriculum.
There was the Blinker drill, with the little light
flashing on and off for the first five minutes of
every class and the first part of every P-work.
This little light seemed to have a hypnotic effect
on most midshipmen. They would stare at it in-
tently for a time, concentrating desperately, and
then suddenly fall into a sort of trance and feel a
delicious sensation of rest creeping over them,
while the light winked on and off unheeded, and
the Blinker Tree began to grow prodigiously.
There were also the flag hoist drills on the Drill
Field, in which cruiser 4, stationed in the south-
west corner of the field, was informed that a tor- -
pedo was mowing down the long grass to star-
board in zone three. Nonchalant in the face of
such danger, cruiser 4 acknowledged the signal,
and nothing more was heard of the torpedo so it
must have missed.
On the same field semaphore drills were held,
and midshipmen, already sufficiently depressed,
began displaying bodily entanglements.
IT WAS generally agreed that Damage Control
was the toughest course in the curriculum. It
had to go some to beat Navigation, Ordnance and
Seamanship, but it had what it takes and came
romping in, a winner by several lengths.
It began with an indoctrination course in
Engineering Drawing. Midshipmen had to draw
blocks, starting out with simple parallelepipeds
and gradually (but not gradually enough) working
up to horribly distorted shapes which looked like
a California architect’s conception of the House of
Seven Gables. It was necessary to show in the
drawings, not only all the visible lines, but all the
invisible ones as well; and Midshipmen discovered
that there is nothing which makes you so cross-
eyed as trying to look at an object three ways at
once.
All this, however, was but a preamble to the
course itself. Damage Control is the art of keep-
ing a ship afloat and in a fighting condition after
it has been hit by a few assorted enemy projectiles.
In order to patch up the various holes, fractures
and contusions which occur in the plating and
frames of the ship when such projectiles hit it,
something more than a tack hammer and a sheet
of galvanized tin is necessary. As a matter of fact,
so far as the Midshipmen could see, a degree in
engineering, with a minor in mathematics was the
qualification for patching up a medium-sized hole
in a Higgins boat; while to repair any ship larger
than a Higgins boat, a man must know every
rivet in the ship by its first name; be able to in-
tegrate mentally a stability curve within five
seconds; and completely understand the General
Theory of Relativity.
The Department was notorious for the problems
it dished out. One instructor publicly confessed
that whenever a nightmare, woke him up in the
middle of the night, he immediately got out of bed
and wrote down a problem for the next P-work.
Mixed in .with four or five ordinary problems,
each of which involved an impossible amount of
. brain strain, would be a whimsical little problem
like the following: “A ship has a designers’ length
of 403 feet. Its dead rise is 5.5 feet, its displace-
ment in salt water is 1500 tons, and the height of
its mainmast is 50 feet above mean low water,
what is the ship’s displacement in fresh water? ”
damage Control
The hapless Midshipmen had a vague suspicion
that fresh water displacement was the same as salt
water displacement; but they knew that no Damage
Control problem could be that easy. So, they
spent the rest of the period trying to correlate the
designer’s length, dead rise, and height of main-
mast above mean low water; gnawing their finger-
nails down to the first knuckle and twitching
spasmodically at regular intervals. When the bell
rang, they handed in their papers and trudged
back to their billets, feeling sure that their next
week-end,. like the last one, would be spent under.,
the auspices of the Damage Control Department.
By way of entertainment and relaxation, the De-
partment, once each week, provided a moving
picture. The pictures were held in Washington
Hall, that insomniac’s paradise, and were very
sober and serious in nature; nothing light and
giddy to bore the audience with its frivolity.
They featured, in serial form the building of a
ship, and Midshipmen awaited each new episode
with breathless anticipation. “What part do you
suppose will go on this week?” they asked each
other eagerly.

ON THE thirty-first day of May, Anno Domini
Nineteen hundred and forty-three, observant
citizens of. the thriving municipality of South Bend,
Indiana, may have noticed open trucks, crammed
to the bursting point with the flower of American
young-manhood, steaming at standard speed to-
wards the verdant campus of the University of
Notre Dame.
Class Number Three was reporting for duty.
Truckload after truckload of embryonic ensigns
was disgorged upon the greensward, and there the
future officers sat, wearied by long train trips from
Florida, from California, from North Dakota and
South Carolina. There they sat for about five
minutes, that is; at the end of which time they
were called to attention by an Officer. It was a
long, long time before they sat at their ease again.
The Officer gave them a little talk. “You are
the lowest form of animal life in the Navy”, he
said. “Some day you may, by hard word and
diligent application, attain the rank of Midship-
man; which rank is not much better than your
present one. Until that time, however, keep your
insignificance constantly in mind.”
Then he divided them alphabetically and sent
them to their various halls “on the double”.
In the ensuing weeks they were destined to hear
many repetitions of that harsh phrase, “on the
double”, and to learn that, while in Navy, they
had to run at top speed to wherever they were
going, and then stand in line for half an hour or
so when they got there.
First they stood in line to turn in their orders
and be assigned to their billets; then they stood in
line to draw their bedding; and then they stood in
a gigantic line at the stadium to draw their uni-
forms. Loud were the lamentations as they tried
to force size 3 crew hats down,over their skulls, of
to roll up endless trousers legs. “Don’t worry, it’ll
shrink when it’s been washed a few times,” said a
Supply Officer to an unfortunate seaman whose
T-shirt was draped around him like a 1903 bathing
suit. “Don’t worry, it’ll stretch after you’ve worn
it a while,” said the Supply Officer to another poor
wretch, whose T-shirt was slowly strangling him
to death.	' '	-
When they had all been uniformed, they were
herded into the already familiar “column of threes”
and marched to their halls; a melancholy horde,
with trousers legs dragging on the ground, sleeves
dangling to knees, hats perched precariously on
the uttermost pinnacles of heads, and a miscel-
laneous assortment of raincoats, civilian clothes,
and athletic shoes falling out of laundry bags at
ten-second intervals.
It is said that one man got a perfect fit in every
detail of his uniform; the. lucky fellow was a 4-F
civilian who, while standing around watching the
proceedings, had been herded into line by a
zealous Officer. The error was soon discovered,
and he was set free two weeks later.
Thus the first day passed; in the succeeding days
of Indoctrination the luckless Apprentice Seaman
of Class Number Three were so rushed around, so
hurried and buffeted and chased from one end of
the campus to the other, that they found it im-
possible to distinguish one day from the next, if
anyone had asked them what the date was, they
couldn’t have told him. So confused did they be-
come that it sometimes seemed to them as though
Reveille sounded in the middle of the night. But
out of this welter of hurry and confusion certain
prominences protruded, and made lasting im-
pressions on the innocent and permeable minds
of the apprentice seamen.
There was the Physical Examination, wherein .
one encountered the attractive piece of leg art
pasted on the x-ray machine in such a manner
that the x-rayee had to twist himself into the re-
quired contortionist’s posture in order to feast his
eyes on the masterpiece. And the amiable Pharma-
cist’s Mate who stuck ah implement as big as a
tire pump, and much sharper, into bare arms;
drew out a pint or two of blood, and then said,
“Tsk, tsk, too bad; we’ll have to try again.”
Also in the Medical Department were the fre-
quent “shots”, which brought protection from
tetanus, typhoid, yellow fever, smallpox, and. lost
statical stability. The Pharmacists’ Mates seemed
to be engaging in a friendly competition to see
which one could make the most punctures per
minute. One foolhardy A.S. stopped to scratch
himself, and was pierced eleven times before he
got moving again. On the first shot-day, when
two shots and a smallpox vaccination were given,
the mates successfully employed an automatic re-
coil system. Two of them stood facing each other;
when a victim came between them, one stabbed
him in the left arm; the victim naturally recoiled
to the right, and in so doing, was impaled on the
other needle, which was held in the battery posi-
tion by the other mate.
Calisthenics, morning and afternoon. Many an
A.S., roused at 0550 and knowing that he could
look. forward to nothing but fifteen minutes of
jumping-jacks, knee-bends, and push-ups, medi-
tated wistfully upon suicide, like Hamlet; and,
more resolute than the melancholy Dane, was
prevented from shooting himself only by Article
61 in the regulations of the school, which pro-
dently makes “possession or discharging of un-
authorized firearms” a class A offense.
If the morning sessions were bad, those of the
afternoons were worse. The tender-hearted powers
that-be saw that all seamen were well limbered up
by two hours of close-order drill before the exercise
period: but, strangely enough, this limbering up
did not seem to help much. After half an hour of
imitating the violent twistings and jumpings of the
Chief on the platform—a tireless machine with
lungs of leather, a torso of steel, and arms and legs
of Grade A rubber—the panting and groaning
A.S. got as a reward sarcastic comments from
some Officer, who would say, “Come on, mister,
where do you think you are, at a lawn party? Get
on the ball, or I’ll run you around this field till
1800!” Although he was in the last stages of ex-
haustion, the A.S. always felt that if he had a
baseball bat in his hands, he could muster up
enough strength to clip the Officer a good one on
the head with it.
Executive Drill. During the course of many
dusty hours on the drill fields, the seamen gradu-
ally learned to perform an “about face” without
tripping and falling down; and to march in reason-
ably straight lines for reasonably long intervals.
As their feet moved mechanically beneath them,
their minds wandered far away to the South
Pacific, and they pictured themselves at the helm
of a P.T. boat, racing across the blue water straight
towards a doomed enemy battleship, while sun-
tanned 'maidens stood on the white sands of a
nearby beach and excitedly cheered them on in
Polynesian. But just before the deadly torpedo
struck home, they were abruptly awakened by a
rude shock; their errant minds returned to the
dusty drill field, and they realized that “to the
rear, march” had been given, and they had col-
lided violently with the wheeling man in front of
them. And then, of course, up sauntered the
Officer with a vinegar face and snarled out his
“Well, mister, just what do you think you're doing?
Wake up and get those commands, or I’ll have
you polishing brightwork every Saturday for the
rest of your life.” Never had the blue Pacific, the
white sands, and the brown-skinned beauties
seemed so far away. . . ■
plement the squadrons of mosquitoes which were
attracted by the beams of the latter.
As Security Watch they sat, again in the dead
of night, at the desks in the passageways, and
propped their eyes open with their fingers, and at
the prescribed intervals sleep-walked on Routine
Inspections, and printed a faltering “All Secure”
in the logs.
As Mates of the Deck and Assistant Mates of the
Deck they feverishly studied the Fire Bill, trying
to master it before an Officer came to quiz them.
At five minute intervals they paced along the
passageways, bellowing “Now Hear This!----------”
(followed by some routine announcement, which
everybody already knew by heart; the important
announcements somehow were never heard, or
else were heard ten minutes after the announced
event had taken place). Once in a while, if their
post happened to be on the fourth deck, far from
any Officer, they emitted a “Now Hear This!” of
-their own, as, for example, “Now Hear This!
Uniform of the day is crew hat, shoulder boards,
and drill shoes! Carry Bowditch!,” or, “Now
Hear This! There will be no calisthenics this
morning! Breakfast will be served to all hands
in their bunks!” '	. .
They made Routine Inspections of all rooms,
and left slips of paper reading “dirty sink”, “dirty
baseboards,” “dusty bed frames”, or simply (the
work of an anonymous genius whose post was on
a fourth deck) “Cleanliness is next .to Godliness”.
And around 2400 they roused Seaman J. P.
Jones of room 606 from his slumbers and told him
that he had forgotten to log in, and must report
to the battalion office immediately.
There were two bright moments during the
twenty-four hours of duty of these mates and as-
sistant mates: one came as they were about to be
relieved; the other, as they sat at their desks at
dawn and watched the mob of half-asleep seamen
stream past them down the ladders and out to the
parade ground for morning calisthenics.,	.
Watch. Sooner or later they all had watches.
As Roving Watch they, in the dead. of night,
patrolled the boggy shores of the lake, carrying
a nightstick and a ponderous searchlight, and
desperately clubbing to death with the former im-
On Saturdays, Inspection. Standing in motion-
less ranks for several hours (it seemed), while a
terrifying display of stripes—enough to equip a
whole army of ensigns—moved slowly down the	I
I

[182]
lines, throwing piercing glances from heads to feet
and back again. As the dreadful stripes drew
near to him, each horror-stricken seaman sucked
in another cubic centimeter of air, expanding his
chest to its extreme limit, and held his breath. If
perchance some of the stripes halted in front of
him in order to survey him more carefully, he had
to keep holding his breath, although his eyes were
ready to pop out. Every Saturday the breath-
holding record of the world must have been
broken at least four or five times; it is a pity that
there was no one present to act as timer.
After this ordeal, another which was just as bad:
Room Inspection. The cry would go out, “Now
Hear This! Inspecting party on board; all hands
stand by! Absolute silence will be maintained
during inspection!” , In every room, the two
occupants came to parade rest. The one who
was Room Captain and would get the demerits
if anything went wrong, was twitching nervously;
his room-mate, who had nothing to worry about
this week, was the picture of nonchalance.
Bangs and clatters were heard at the other end
of the passageway, as the Inspecting Party pulled
open steel locker doors and peered inside. The
banging and clattering drew nearer. The nervous
Room Captain glanced everywhere in the room,
to make sure that all was shipshape. A towel was
hanging slightly askew; he tiptoed swiftly over and
straightened it. The tap had leaked, and there
was water in the wash-bowl; he inched over to it
and dried it with his handkerchief. (The bangs
and clatterings were much closer now). He glided
back to his starting point and fell into parade rest
again, with a sigh of relief; everything was ready
now. But then he happened to glance at the deck,
and there lay a piece of white string, which had
magically escaped the furious swabbings and
scrubbings of the night before, and which now
stood out like a battleship in a bathtub. Should
he go over and.pick it up? If he didn’t, he’d get
a count for Dirty Deck; if he did, and was caught
before he got back to parade rest, he’d get five
demerits. .
The bangs and clatterings were very close now;
you could even hear the voices of the Inspecting
Officers as they said “Dirty medicine cabinet”,
“Windows not squared,” “Bunks improperly
made,” etc., etc.
After a moment of indecision, the Room Captain
could stand it no longer. He stepped forward;
the deck squeaked loudly under his feet. He
swiftly bent over to pick up the string, and just
then in came—no; it’s all over now; let’s give it
the happy ending, and say that he got back to
parade rest just in the nick of time, and that it
was someone else who was cleaning dummy rifles
in the Drill Hall on the following Saturday after-
noon.
After the Inspection ordeals came blessed-relief
in the form of Liberty; and the members of Class
Three coursed through the town, their natural high .
spirits elevated even further by moderate doses of
the heartening elixirs provided at Sweeney’s.
Surrounded by throngs of admiring young ladies
at the Service Men’s Center; The Country Club,
The Indiana Club, and other centers of festive
merriment, the dazzled seamen forgot the dreary
routine of the week and became again the stalwart
heroes of the P.T. boat; and the glorious delusion
lasted until the late bell for calisthenics rang on
Monday morning.	.
Ultimately Indoctrination came to an end, and
Apprentice Seamen were transformed into Mid-
shipmen, those hybrid creatures who are “officers
[183]
in a qualified sense”, as Naval Regulations tact-
fully put it. At the beginning of the regular term
some changes were made. Competitive sports and
The Commando Course (that crowning example
of man’s inhumanity to man) took the place of
afternoon calisthenics; the number of executive
drill periods was reduced; shoulder boards and
golden anchors blossomed on new Palm Beach
uniforms; payday rolled around every once in a
while, and Midshipmen were kindly permitted to
look at and even to feel their money before it was
confiscated by courteous tailors and laundrymen;
and Navigation, Ordnance, Seamanship, and
Damage Control now loomed horribly in the fore-
ground. They had been bad enough during In-
doctrination; now they were impossible. Tons of
information were shoveled into skulls already
loaded far beyond the Plimsoll mark for South
Bend in summer; trees bloomed luxuriantly every
week, and the monster Restricted Probation
reached out and snatched many a Midshipman
just as the poor wretch was running for the bus
station. But in the distance, like the pot of gold
at. the end of a rainbow; commissions were glim-
mering; and the Midshipmen kept plugging
away, although they knew that by all rights they
should have gone to an asylum weeks ago.
Tough as the regular terms were, it was In-
doctrination which was the real test. It was in
those three short weeks that civilians took the icy
plunge, and came out Navy men; it was then that
the Navy was inoculated into them, like a tetanus
shot. It was a strong and a sudden dose, but that
was unavoidable. Later, when those who survived
the inoculation looked back on the first three weeks,
they realized that in spite of the apparently aim-
less hustle, the travelogues at the Drill Hall, the
incessant marching, the ironclad routine, the
• rigorous discipline, all of which seemed so un-
reasonable to a civilian—that, in spite of ail this,
a great deal had been accomplished in a very short
time; and that they had learned three valuable
lessons, which would profit them all their lives:
first, to make the best possible use of every minute;
second, to be in the right place at the right time;
third, to keep their mouths shut and do what they
were ordered to do, no matter how unjust they
felt the orders to be, or how impossible the tasks
assigned.

Captain Burnett Choir*
BEST KNOWN for the weekly broadcasts over the South Bend
station WSBT, the Captain Burnett Choir also presented one
evening concert for the midshipmen, provided the musical entertain-
ment for several of the drill hall get-togethers, and took a prominent
part in the “Happy Hour” show. Ensign Hardy, Welfare and Recrea-
tion Officer on the station, rated it the best midshipmen choir so far
produced at Notre Dame.
Midshipman Fran Dale, leader of the choir, brought with him ex-
perience gained as student director of the glee club, band, and orchestra
at Duke University. Midshipmen Glen Welch and Bob Lively acted
as accompanists. The a capella choir was under the baton of Mid-
shipman Tom Kerr from De Paul University. The choir had a com-
plement of seventy-five members, many of whom were featured as
soloists.
Midshipman Harvey Bullock and Hal Liebow prepared the radio,
scripts and announced the programs.
3)rum and J^u^le Corps
IT WOULD be difficult to visualize chow formations or those Satur-
day morning inspections and reviews minus the Drum and Bugle
Corps.
Ensign Richard Tainter, Navy bandmaster for more than twenty
years, lost no time in whipping the thirty-five experienced musicians—
buglers, drummers, and trombonists—into a -smart and versatile
military band. A short week after the beginning of the indoctrination
period our steps were lightened by such stimulating marches as
“Semper Fideles” and “You’re in the Navy Now”. The duties of
drum major were in the very capable hands of Midshipman Galen H.
Frantz, who as a student directed the band at Manchester College,
Manchester, Indiana.
In addition to their regular duties, members of this organization
willingly sacrificed precious time for performances at several civic
affairs in South Bend. Visitors on the campus and midshipmen alike
were fully aware of the sparkling and efficient work done by the
Drum and Bugle Corps.
3)ance (Bana
NO ONE could question the popularity of the
Midshipmen’s Dance Band. It was more
than a group of college men sitting in for a jam
session—a great deal more. The band quickly
earned a reputation for being one of the hardest
working outfits on the station.
Ensign G. A. Hardy organized and managed
the band. Midshipman Frank Tinker acted, as
director. The band possessed a complete reper-
toire of dance music, but it featured special ar-
rangements of famous swing numbers, just what
the medical officer ordered for book-weary mid-
shipmen. In addition to playing for the U. S. O.
Tea Dances each Saturday afternoon, the band
was on hand to give out with a few solid licks at
nearly all of the special evening programs presented
in the Drill Hall.
• ■ ■ - .. \
Of the fourteen musicians in this organization
the outstanding soloists were Midshipmen Camp-
bell on trumpet, Henline on trombone, and Tinker
and Duda from the sax section. As an added at-
traction, Midshipmen G. T. Bunch and his
“Scuttlebutt Quartette” sang with the band.
[188]
WHEN the call for extra curricular activities
was passed through the halls, more than one
hundred apprentice seamen turned out to offer
their talents and experience toward the publica-
tion of a class book. Of these men thirty found
time at odd moments to see the job through. This,
the third class book of the Notre Dame Midship-
men’s School is the fruit of our combined efforts.
Those men constantly popping out of nowhere
with candid cameras represented our staff of photo-
graphers. The man who was always sketching in
the margins Of his seamanship notes may have been
one of our cartoonists or artists. The odd-looking
fellow sitting off to one side gnawing on the stub
of a pencil was probably one of our writers trying
to make the dead line. These were the men who
made up the Capstan staff.
Working quietly in the background were the ad-
vertising and business men. They, convinced
business men that advertising space in our book
was a good investment and they took your money
just when you were running short. But to them
fell the responsibility of paying for the Capstan.
[ 189 ]
“ANYTHING GOES,” was the order of the
evening. For more than two hours the
Drill Hall resounded with continual applause and
laughter as officers, midshipmen, and their guests
expressed delight and satisfaction. Our “Happy
Hour”, the midshipmen’s one chance to reveal his
true feelings with no. holds barred, was a tre-
mendous success. It was all in fun, but the officer
who did not find the crowd laughing at his ex-
pense at least once during the evening could con-
sider himself lucky indeed.
It was an event anticipated by all for many
weeks, and the members of the Happy Hour Gang
gave it their best. Any midshipman with a knack .
for'entertaining was certain to find a spot in this
show. Master of Ceremonies Harvey Bullock was
able to mold the great variety of performances
into a fast moving, well balanced program, which
would have done credit to professional showmen.
“What. . . school . . . are YOU from?” drawled
a queer looking ensign in a drape-shape uniform.
It was Midshipman Somers and the Fourth Bat-
talion presenting their impressions of a class under
“Rodney, the Recognizer” which held the au-
dience in a sustained panic of laughter. The
Third Battalion’s contribution, “Ninety Day
• Nightmare”, was a wild combination of burlesque
and slap-stick comedy which more than lived up
to its title. The Second Battalion’s skit featured
the “Battalion Rockettes” fresh from the drill field
and three months of grueling training under a
certain company commander well known around
the station for his New England snarl, “Look
sharp, mistah.”
“My Son, My Son”, rendered by the First
Battalion’s little theatre group climaxed the show.
In this skit an irate Mrs. Moor presented to the
assistant senior watch dog of the station a letter
from her son, Eldridge, in which he said that the
midshipmen were not happy here. The officer,
however, through the medium of a few typical
scenes of life at the midshipmen’s school soon con-
vinced her that it was impossible for anyone to be
unhappy at Notre Dame.
The musical portions of the show were well pro-
vided for by the Captain Burnett Choir and the
Midshipmen’s Dance Band. “Spotlight Bands”
by the Dance Band featuring imitations of Tommy
Dorsey, Glen Miller, Benny Goodman, and other
great name bands proved, to be the musical hit of
the evening. The entire show was under the di-
rection of Ensign G. A. Hardy, Welfare and Re-
creation Officer of the station.
Z)ke ^bramatic Club
As by tradition at Notre Dame Midshipmen
School, the Dramatic Club kept activity coming
throughout the school term.
Planning skits for the Happy Hour, setting the
stage for a three act murder riot and announcing
for the Captain Burnett Choir were just a few of
the many things this club did.
Midshipman Harvey Bullock did a grand job as
M. C. for the Happy Hour. In addition to this
mirthquake, he set the stage for the Choir each
Monday evening for their
weekly broadcast over sta-,
tion WSBT.,
As for the play this class
presented “Arsenic and Old
Lace”. This three act mur--
der farce about two old ladies
who poisoned “old lonely
bachelors” was directed by
Midshipman Jack Thomas-
son. Outstanding personali-
ties in the cast were Midship-
men Chris Smith, Borthwick,
Russell, Gardiner, and Zum-
, mack. Two battalions
watched the action each
afternoon it was presented.
In addition to the actual
dramatization of the show,
there was the necessary work
of costumes, stage settings,
properties and the added
hours of work just about
exam time.
THERE WAS a bell. A haze. A maze of shoes,
shirts, shorts and staggering bodies. Again a
bell—but at a distance. Suddenly the sharp re-
port of 1-2-3-4 eroding the nervous system, cell
by cell. The haze began to lift and' Mr. Middie
found himself doing the “old” jumping jack in an
uncoordinated series of complex convulsions.
. Thus we were instructed in the meaning of the
term “calisthenics” and its place in the Naval rou-
tine (0555 local uncivil time). And under the
genuine enthusiasm of Chief Ahearne, moulder of
morning muscles, we were inspired to greater,
calisthenic heights each dawn, Monday through
Saturday—and the rains rarely came.
We did enjoy though the fine athletic program
under the supervision of Lt. Brown, who in true
democratic fashion gave us our choice of Nucom,
baseball, touch football, tennis, track or volley-
ball. For the benefit of those who had never been
nearer water than the backyard well there was the
“sub” squad. And for the benefit of those not
raised in trees, there was the commando course.
Touch football attracted the numerous ex-grid-
iron greats among us, the caliber of the games
showing their influence. The other men, of John
Q. Public ability, had to suffer the consequences,
coming from games in various shades of black,
blue, red, and even white in small areas. As a
matter of fact, there were a couple of rules for the
game, and they did use a football—so let’s call it
football anyhow.
For the V—for Victory chassis that adds appeal
[ 202 ]■
to a suit of skin-tight whites, the novel game of
nucom was offered. We heard the game was in-
troduced by a body rub manufacturer trying to
drum up business in those dark depression days.
After all, grunting a 16 pound medicine ball
around for an hour certainly isn’t the most tender
of activities. The game is a sort of heavy weight
brand of volley ball, but its enthusiasts claim it is
superior to the original because of the marvelous
sedative effect it can have on a middie’s muddled
mind. A few drives taken on the skull is guaran-
teed to relieve the most highly strung of his stringing.
Not all the middies felt so ambitious, though so
many turned out for the great American sport,
baseball, a patriotic gesture, we have been led to
understand. Nevertheless, company competition
was at its flood tide in the endeavor, due perhaps
to the greater opportunity for blowing off steam
and general Bronx jeering. Scuttlebutt had it
that Big League scouts, en route to various old
age homes in search of talent, would stop and gaze
on our games with mouths open and watering at
the raft of such youthful and goodly material.
The track season was highlighted by the track-
ster’s coach luminary, Chief Quinn running away
with the mile trial in the A. A. U. meet at Soldier’s
Field, Chicago. Thus inspired by such exertions
the galloping gobs spend many minutes each week
chasing their chief around the oval getting in shape
for the meet that never came. Apparently these
little red ration stamps, which the Navy seems to
be so short on, were required even for track meat.
[ 203 ]
a
However, there was some tough competition in the
inter-battalion event; the second battalion winning
only after the last event was run.
The commando course was the scene of most
laughs. Remember that first day when you found
yourself face to face with a very high and very flat
wall, which object was to be put beneath you?
And the first maneuvers to accomplish same,
something like this: 1st attempt—knees buckled
and knocked nose; 2nd attempt—knees buckled;
3rd attempt—knees knocked; 4th attempt ....
5th ..... “The nurses were swell in sick bay!”
Then, after conditioning'to that, a long hori-
zontal rope was introduced to be traversed with
body parallel to same, ape fashion, as a kind of
toe developer. We think they borrowed the idea
from a zoo. But there is no complaint forthcoming;
it did accomplish its purpose. Our toes are in fine
shape now. But the final obstacle of the course,
on the home stretch, was the most irritating. It
was only with great, difficulty that we avoided
tripping over our tongues, at that point hanging
several feet out.
And so we have been put in fighting trim at
Notre Dame. We take leave fully able to keep
our chins off our chests, our chests above our belt
lines, and our belt lines much reduced. Sometimes
it took some uncomfortable effort—especially in
the hour of dawn—but we are glad for it on remi-
niscing because we are off to the wars in a state of
physical health. For which, thank you Lt. Brown.

Jjberty,
TIME, for Class Number Three, was measured
from one Liberty to the-next. No sooner did
Midshipmen secure to their rooms at 1800 on Sun-
day (which marked the end of one Liberty— than
their thoughts turned to 1430 on Saturday (which
marked the beginning of the next).
But the path to a week-end liberty was strewn
with many obstacles, prominent among which were
Trees, Restricted Probation, Watches, and Extra-
Duty Squad. Midshipmen had to sidestep very
carefully to avoid these snares for the unwary;
many luckless sufferers were of the opinion that it
couldn’t be done.
As Monday and Tuesday rolled by, a few fell by
the wayside: some were assigned demerits and
extra-duty hours for some horrible crime, such as
appearing in ranks with shoes not polished to the
degree of brilliance. On Wednesday, those who
had been fortunate enough to get an invitational
letter from someone’s Aunt Susie in Chicago might
be seen feverishly drafting their Shore Leave
papers, which had to be printed exactly in the
prescribed manner, down to the most inconspicuous
[210]
aBUHasssK
comma. Thursday came, arid then Friday: That
was the day which tried men’s souls. It was then
that the Trees came out, and Midshipmen, with all
ten fingers crossed, tried to push their way through
the crowd in front of the bulletin board and get a
look at the fatal lists. A sound of mingled groans
and cheers perturbed the air as Midshipmen gave
vent to their emotions upon finding, or not finding,
their names among the spreading boughs of one or
more trees. Midshipmen who had been models
of righteousness all week, and who planned
wonderful things for the week-end, only to find
themselves lodged in the branches of the Damage
Control tree when the goal was so near, were
sometimes known to give way under the strain.
It is reported that one individual, who had been
put on one tree or another for three weeks in a
row, went rushing up and down the passageways
with hair all mussed and an insane gleam in his
eyes, screaming “Give me Liberty or give me
Death I” at the top of his lungs.
At last came Saturday. Morning classes, then
the Inspection ordeals, then perhaps an afternoon
class, which dragged on interminably. But at last
the hands of the clock reached 1430, and the ring-
ing of the bells proclaimed liberty throughout the
station. Shortly thereafter busses bulging with
[ 211 J
Midshipmen labored into South Bend and un-
loaded; Midshipmen dispersed in a hundred dif-
ferent directions; some to the Service Men’s Center,
some to the movies, some to certain oases where
cooling and healthful beverages might be obtained.
The sidewalks of the city were dappled with the
brown of palm beach uniforms. Back at Notre.
Dame the station was deserted, except for the
luckless victims of Extra-Duty, who were sadly
patrolling their beats, mournfully shifting the rifle
from one shoulder to the other to relieve their
muscles and break the monotony.
Night came on, the hours went swiftly by, and
Midshipmen reluctantly discontinued their joyous
activities in order to catch the last bus back to the
.station and log in at 0059. But after breakfast next
morning they were released again, and continued
where they had left off; dining, dancing, and con-
versing raptly with beautiful women.
All too soon there was, another bus to catch; and
promptly at 1800 each Midshipman loped into his
room, in time for the check-up. He sat in his chair
with his feet on the desk, vacantly gazing into space.
In his nostrils still lingered the scent of Enorme
Odeur, the perfume which so recently had been
wafted to him from behind the ears of that lovely
blonde. .He heaved a sigh. He had the .next
week-end completely planned already; now if he
could only get by that Damage Control on Tuesday
and the Ordnance on Wednesday—
[214]
U. <S. 0. <Skow^
MIDSHIPMEN could always tell a USO show
was coming whenever they were teetering
precariously on the brink of Restricted Probation,
whenever assignments were piling up in heaps even
larger than usual, whenever there was a series of
important P-works in the offering—in short,
whenever every spare minute was needed for
grinding away at textbooks a USO show would
be announced, with attendance required. And,
muttering a brief prayer for divine guidance in
the Damage Control exam of the morrow, Midship-
men would fall in and march to the Drill Hall,
where the festivities were to take place.
The Drill Hall is a building of mammoth pro-
portions. Eagles have been known to nest high
up in the beams under its curving roof, and a
daring amateur ornithologist who once climbed
up there to get a couple of eagle eggs was forced
to descend before he had accomplished his pur-
pose, because the high altitude gave him a nose-
bleed. Sound waves from the Hall’s public ad-
dress system go up into these dizzy heights and re-
bound from rafter to rafter, not returning to earth
for months. During an Ordnance drill in Mid-
August some Midshipmen claimed to have heard
faint echoes of the speeches made during the last
graduation ceremonies. And the length and
breadth of the Drill Hall 'rival its height. An
officer at one end who wishes to communicate
with an officer at the other end must either tele-
phone or send a dispatch rider on a bicycle.
It is therefore evident that when a performance
is going on at one end of the building, there will
be Midshipmen sitting at the other end who can
neither hear nor see what is going on.
As the Midshipmen filed in on USO night and
filled the hundreds of rows of folding chairs, a good
fifty percent of them were in this predicament.
The overhead lights were extinguished with the
entrance of a Master of Ceremonies to the plat-
form. All that the Midshipmen at the other end
of the Hall could see was his derby hat, rising above
the. rows and rows of heads which loomed in front
of them and blocked the view. The Master of
Ceremonies began to speak; all that the Midship-
men in the back rows could hear was a faint
buzzing noise, like a hungry mosquito; but the
front rows burst into uproarious laughter. Then
the various acts came on. Perhaps a sextette of
lovely dancing girls, with charming smiles and
rationed costumes: The front rows howled ap-
proval, but all that the back rows could see was a
shapely arm which now and then appeared above
the massed heads in front of them. Then per-
haps a juggler, and at last the back rows saw
something: three white balls, a cane, and an old
shoe, which magically rose and descended again.
The back rows' couldn’t see where these objects
were coming from or where they were going, but
they didn’t care: They began to feel some of the
enthusiasm of the front rows, and started to cheer
lustily until the finale.

Take this book for better or for worse, but your
best enjoyment will come when leafing through it
after we have won this war.
THOSE who dared put another obstacle in front
of graduation came out for the Capstan. The
innumerable hours of picture taking, name check-
ing, and ad solicitation were not willingly sacri-
ficed in time of study needs. But of course most
of the newly commissioned officers will remember
the Capstan staff, choir, and bugle corps for their
ability to get out of twenty-four hour watches and
the athletic periods, (obstacle course). Never-
theless, there has been an attempt, vain or other-
wise, to provide Notre Dame’s third Midshipmen’s
class with an enjoyable remembrance of those de-
licious meals, extra duty squads, tree lists, executive
drill, watches, shots in the arm, U. S. O., cleaning
the billets, sounding off, P Work, South Bend
weekends, carrying Bowditch, and those char-
acters of Happy Hour fame.

c4ppreciation
TT IS not possible to publish a Capstan without the extra help and advice
of many generous people. Whether you accept this book or not, there
are those who deserve our appreciation for all they have done.
First of all, the staff would like to thank all the officers and midshipmen
for the trouble they went to in the picture-taking process. Those appoint-
ments did not always come at the most opportune time and the retakes
were probably more discouraging.	;
We particularly wish to thank our officer advisors, Lt. Haralson F. Smith,
and Lt. (jg) Kenneth G. Pearce for their cooperation and needed guidance.
Lt. (jg) P. T. Sprinz is to be thanked for his advice and help in obtaining
pictures and information.
Mr. Ray Moran, our publisher, offered much of his time and energy
toward the betterment of this book. Moffett Studios of Chicago gave us
extremely prompt service for such a short working period.
The Waves in the Administrative Office are to be thanked for their typing.
J. P. Haller (V-12) deserves a vote of thanks for spending so much of his
time taking Midshipmen pictures.
It is the work and inspiration of people such as these that make our class
book possible and this is but one small way that we may show our apprecia-
tion.
[ 228 ]
. Of ihank?
A brief word of thanks to our advertisers
. . . with whose support this book was pub-
lished ... with whose support this war will
be won.
Today—our advertisers are working for
Uncle Sam ...
Tomorrow—they will be working for you
again. Give them your whole-hearted sup-
port now and in the years to come . . .

SOUTH BEND LATHE WORKS
SOUTH BEND 22, INDIANA

Fighting ships are huge machines composed of engines,
turbines, pumps, hundreds of precision instruments
and automatic controls, all of which must be kept in
order at all times. Maintenance and repair are always
important. But when it becomes a case of "fix it or
sink,” grave responsibilities fall upon the ship’s ma-
chine shop. Tool equipment must be equal to the
emergency—accuracy and speed are absolute require-
ments. The Navy expects machines, as well as men,
to deliver unfailing performance.
It is significant that South Bend Lathes have been se-
lected for service in the machine shops on board many
of the Navy’s fighting ships. Providing these lathes is
one of our many wartime jobs.

THE MINNEAPOLIS-MOLINE
WAR RECORD
Minneapolis-Moline is proud to have its Como Plant re-
ceive the Army-Navy "E” Award.
We are proud o£ the more than 900 men and women of
MM who left us to serve in the Armed Forces. We are
proud of our loyal MM dealers who are helping farmers
produce Food for Freedom with limited quantities of farm
machinery by keeping their machines in good repair.
Even before 1938 Minneapolis-Moline was working on
the conversion of a farm tractor to serve our Armed Forces.
This vehicle was the first vehicle that the Armed Forces
called the "Jeep”, so named by Army men at Camp Ripley,
Minnesota, in 1940. Minneapolis-Moline produced this
for the Armed Forces long before Pearl Harbor.
Minneapolis-Moline was one of the first 100 firms in the
United States to set up a Labor-Management Committee to
help increase production.
Minneapolis-Moline was among the first to advertise na-
tionally the need for getting all scrap into the big scrap and
has consistently followed up this program.
The United States Treasury Department reports that Min-
neapolis-Moline was one of the first 100 large firms whose
employees regularly invested 10% or better in War Savings
Bonds and Stamps through the Payroll Deduction Plan. For
this Minneapolis-Moline proudly displays the Treasury "T”
Minute Man Flag. MM was one of the first to tell farmers
nationally of the urgency of investing every possible dollar
in War Savings Bonds and Stamps.
Minneapolis-Moline was one of the first 45 firms in the
United States to be awarded the United States Maritime "M”
Pennant, the Victory Fleet Flag and Maritime Labor Merit
Badges for its employees by the United States Maritime
Commission in recognition of Minneapolis-Moline’s out-
standing production achievements in helping build victory
ships.
MM has contributed to the War Production Fund of the
National Safety Council to help stop accidents that have
killed or injured over 11,600 workmen every day since
Pearl Harbor. More than a year ago, Minneapolis-Moline
was awarded the Governor’s Safety Award Pennant for a '
well established safety program in every plant.
Minneapolis-Moline and its employees have regularly
supported every worthwhile cause and endeavor that helps
assure final and complete victory.
Minneapolis-Moline manufactures all the farm machinery
and tractors allowed under Government Limitation Orders
for which materials can be obtained, and many quality prod-
ucts for our Armed Forces so that complete victory may be
ours sooner.

More and more Flying Fortresses are powered
by Studebaker-built Cyclone engines
Clear-eyed, clean-hearted young
Americans are up there in those Fly-
ing Fortresses—writing new chap-
ters of a free world’s destiny. Many
of them were carefree school boys
only yesterday. Today, they’re pour-
ing cringing fear into the souls of
once boastful “supermen.” To these
gallant youngsters—and to their ex-
pert crews below that keep them fly-
ing—we of Studebaker pledge our-
selves to go on producing more and
still more of the mighty Wright Cy-
clone engines for these devastating
Boeing bombers. The same skill—
the same Studebaker plus—which
have gone into every Studebaker car
and truck—are today going into the
equipment we’re building for victory.
We’ll “give more than we promise”
in the best Studebaker tradition.
Meanwhile, civilian needs must and
will wait . . . until Studebaker com-
pletes this wartime assignment . . .
until the finer Studebaker cars and
trucks of a brighter day can be built.
Awarded to Aviation Division
Big Studebaker military trucks stand out in all
the major war zones—Besides producing
many Flying Fortress engines, Studebaker is
also one of the largest builders of multiple-
drive military trucks. We’re proud of our assign-
ments in arming our Nation and its Allies.

Congratulation^
"A combination of circumstances makes the Navy unusually welcome
to faculty and students at Notre Dame. First, the record of Notre
Dame’s cooperation with the armed forces in the Civil War, the Spanish-
American War, and World War I makes her eager to be of further
service. And the bond thus established has become even closer during
times of peace. Now it may be said that’the type of officers and men
assigned to the campus in the R. O. T. G., V-1, and V-7, are so repre-
sentative of the best traditions of the service that the units under the
command of Captain Henry P. Burnett and his efficient staff have been
accepted as part of the Notre Dame family."
