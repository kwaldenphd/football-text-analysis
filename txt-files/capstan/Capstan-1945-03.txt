USNR MIDSHIPMEN’S SCHOOL
(1 / fhen the treachery of Pearl
Harbor left us a broken
fleet, when every battle was a
losing battle and every action a
retreat, there were a-few un- .
daunted, courageous men to fight
with what they had, to lose
battles and retreat when they ,
must, so that behind them the
forces might gather, and a nation
might arm.
We dedicate this seventh Cap-
stan to those men who fought
their way from defense to offense;
to those who battled the Japanese
from the Philippines to Port
Moresby—and back again. ..

Few men.—and even fewer Americans—have so influenced the course of
world events as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States
and Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army and Navy. Never
before has an American commanded such a fighting force; never before has
an American assumed such responsibility. Not alone must he coordinate
the armed forces to the accomplishment of one end, but he must also con-
trol such incalculable domestic forces as economics, production, morale; all
the harvest of dragon teeth sown by the careless hand of War. Upon this
burden is tossed- one more—perhaps the heaviest of the lot—the burden of
state affairs, the relationship of the United States to foreign nations. His is
the task not only of securing such cooperation with our allies as will win the
war, but of maintaining such cooperation to win the peace. In this man’s
hands a majority of the American voters have, for the fourth time, placed
their problems and their trust.








You members of this Seventh Class of the Midshipman School at Notre Dame, in the past four
months, have learned that the Navy is. exacting in its standards, high in its ideals. There is now
’ placed on your shoulders the responsibility of upholding these standards and these ideals.
You will find yourselves in grave and responsible positions. You will- find yourselves facing
dangers, andfighting opposition designed to wipe freedom, honesty, and decency from the face of the
.earth. But'regardless of what you find or face, I feel confident that the highest traditions of the
Navy will be. safeguarded in your hands.	..
Good luck to you all.
J. Richard Barry
Captain, U. S. Navy
The naval career of Captain Barry; embracing
thirty-nine years in the service of his country, is
one of color and versatility including duty aboard
practically every type of ship under the American
flag and in nearly every water on_ the face of
the earth. ■ '	,
Captain Barry was appointed to the Naval
Academy in 1905 and upon graduation four years
later was assigned to the battleship Missouri. Later
he was transferred to the destroyer Drayton and
then back to battleship service on the Navy’s first
dreadnaught, the Michigan.	,	‘
• - During World War I, Captain Barry assumed
command of the Pampanga, a former Spanish gun-
boat sunk by Dewey in the battle of Manila Bay.
This gunboat was subsequently raised and placed
in commission by the U. S. Navy. After extensive
duty in China and far eastern waters, he was made
Captain of the Yard and Aide-to the Commandant
at the Naval Station at Cavite, P. I. >
Later he served, aboard another battleship, the
North Dakota, and from there was transferred to
. duty with the Navy Department in Washington.
His next command was the destroyer Reno. Then,
after a tour of duty at Annapolis as instructor in
Seamanship and Flight Tactics, he served on the
staff of the Commander of the. Train Squadron of
the Atlantic Fleet.	. ' _•	.
Returning to shore duty in Washington, Captain
Barry graduated from the Naval War College and
became executive officer of the light cruiser
Trenton. In 1938 he was made commanding
officer of the Trenton after an intervening period ’
of duty ashore as executive officer of the Naval
Training Station, Newport, Rhode Island. Under
his command the Trenton became the flagship of
the European Squadron. He came to Notre Dame
from Colombia, South America, where he served
for two years as Chief of the U. S. Naval Mission
to that country.
Welcome aboard to Commander.
Hutchinson, new Executive Officer, who
succeeded Lieut. Comdr. W. P. Burleigh,
USNR, temporarily serving as Executive
Officer after the retirement of Commander
Thomab C. Scaffe, USN (Ret.).	.
This is the first shore assignment for
Commander Hutchinson, who has served
mostly on destroyers since his graduation
nine and one-half years ago from the U. S.
Naval Academy, Annapolis.
His tour of sea duty includes both the
Atlantic and Pacific, his ships having :
participated in bombardments of Guadal-
canal and Munda airfield on New Georgia
island, the invasion of southern France, •
and aided in convoy, duty. Comdr.
Hutchinson’s last ship was . the destroyer
MACOMB,, of which he assumed com-
•' mand for . seven months duty in the
Mediterranean.	.	, .

It has been a challenge and a responsibility	f
. rarely enjoyed—to share in the vitally impor-
tant task of training you young American men to
become Naval Reserve Officers, prepared in the . . I
technology of ultra-modern Naval warfare.
You graduates go forth as Ensigns, deter-	f
mined to. press a hard and victorious fight	[
against all enemies. You Ensigns are thoroughly	i
indoctrinated in the firm truth—THE SEC-	|

Deciding to try something new in this

blondes, brunettes, and redheads from
every state in the Union, solid proof of the
achievements of Notre Dame Midshipmen,

shoulders of Mil ton Caniff, creator of
“Terry and the Pirates” and “Male Gall,”
fell the task of selecting the most beautiful
of the beautiful. That Mr. Caniff was the
right man for the job is well evidenced by
the next few pages of feminine perfection.

We gratefully acknowledge our debt to Lt. Cronin,
through whose able fingers ran all the threads that bound
? 'this Capstan together. And to those officers who guided
and directed our efforts in the various fields of our
activity go pur thanks; to: Lt. Pence, art; Lt. Pearce,
advertising; and Lt. Wagner, photography. x
An old Arab story tells of a huge boulder that was started from some place in the Middle East ■	■
along the road the pilgrims took to Mecca. As each Arab came to the stone he lifted it and threw
it as far as he could along the road. After many centuries the boulder reached its destination.
Sometimes it seems that the Capstan got to the printers much the same way.
Those harried, midshipmen you may have noticed around the school .were worried not over
finals but deadlines. Those thoughtful ones were planning a new layout. The frantic ones were
. tearing their hair over the lack of pictures from the photographers. The fiendishly chuckling	I
ones were struck with the idea for a devilish cartoon. And you couldn’t have missed the mid-	I
shipmen photographers who popped up from under the table to snap you enjoying your Saturday
afternoon stew, who blinded you at inspections,, and who were always on the scene of a mishap or
accident just hoping it would happen again.	• ,
‘	J	■ -	■ •	.	.	:
Of course the Capstan staff didn’t spend all its free time on the Capstan—it just seemed like that.
There were times when we shrugged our shoulders at our-storm-struck. work room and dashed off
to Sweeney’s—but, somehow, we always came back, with an inspiration more or less. Finally,
somewhere along the line,-it happened, and the thing was done.
So here’s where we give-it one last fling. From now on it’s your problem.	.	i

Whose idea it was, I cannot remember. If I could find the man I would—but
that is another story; and I am supposed to tell you now what happened when I
was assigned to interview an average midshipman as he came out of a final exam.
I picked my way carefully through the throng of dazed, stumbling midshipmen
until I came on one who was walking cheerfully along and whistling gaily through
his teeth. This, thought I, is the man.	■
Accosting him, I introduced myself as a representative of the Capstan, explained
my purpose, and asked for his cooperation. He replied that he would be glad to
do anything he could and the interview proceeded as follows:
Q.: How did you find the test? .	.	■
A.: Oh, it could’ve been worse. •	. ■ .	'
Q,.: Then you did all right?	-	’
A.: Yeah, I think I hit it.	•
Q.: Then to what do you attribute your success? Study? Nowomen? Noliquor?
A.: Well, I wouldn’t say that. No—I have a system. .
Q.: A system? .Tell me. It may be of inestimable value to future.generations of
midshipmen. Now, what.is it? (At this point we were settled in his room, relax-
ing with a cigarette.)	‘	.
, A.: Y’see, whenever there’s something I want especially to remember I think of
something it reminds me of.	.
Q.: Oh, metynomics.	. .	.	■	-
A.: What? .	.
Q,.: A sort of mental crutch.
A.: Oh, yeah—yeah, that’s it. Y’see, take the first question on the test fr*instance.
It was something like: What man, men, or midshipman said, “Surrender be damned.
I have not yet begun to fight?”	'	. ’
Q,.: But that was-—1	.	'
. A.: Please! This is my system! Well, this instantly reminds you of the famous
picture of the old sea battle, the one where the battle is raging furiously, the ship
is slowly sinking, the men are in rags, and at the top of the foremast a tattered
marine, one arm wounded, and bleeding, is doggedly loading and firing his musket
into the crowded decks below. An immaculately clad officer steps out of his cabin,
freshly shaven, not a Hair out of place, as the opposing captain shouts: “Do you
surrender, sir?” The officer shouts back: “Surrender be damned. I have not yet
begun to fight.” And the tattered, bleeding marine looks down.and mutters:
“There’s always some son of—. •	'	.	.
Q.: —a gun who never gets the word” (I hastily interpolated). But how does
that get you any nearer the answer?	.
A.: That wasn’t the'way I heard it. Well, the marine reminds you of brass
buttons, brass buttons remind you of a bell hop, hops remind you of beer, beer
reminds you of—oh, no, that’s another one.. Let’s see, bell reminds you of liberty,
liberty reminds you of what the governor of North Carolina said to the governor
of South Carolina. Which reminds me, how long is it till liberty? ।	'
Q.: Three days, 12 hours, and 23 minutes. But, go on.
A.: Oh, yes. Well, that reminds you that you haven’t got a date for Saturday
night, which reminds you of 1492. And there you have it.
Q.: Have what? .	.'	■'
A.: .The answer. Christopher Columbus.	'
“Oh, yes—yes,” I muttered. And at this point I must admit, your interviewer’s
mind got up, creaked in all its joints and hobbled off on a pair of crutches of its own'

Things certainly have been dull around here . . . what with finals three.weeks away and nothing much to. do
but sit and wait and hope for the best. However, I’ve tried to keep busy and make good use of my time, especially
the weekends which give me a chance to catch up on all my back work; you already know how much effort it takes
to get through here successfully.	• •
In your last letter you seemed to be somewhat worried about my getting a Tittle conceited over my zoot
uniform and not behaving myself on the weekend. Gosh, Honey, that should be your last worry in the world.
You know there’ll never be anyone else but you.	-	.
Just as a sort of clinching argument in my behalf, I’d like to outline one'of my typical weekends for you . . .
say this last week. I just hope you aren’t as bored hearing about it as I was undergoing it, because it was really
a calm one.	-
• The first thing we did when liberty was declared, the four of us, my roomate and two other guys, was to go
into South Bend and stop at “Sweeney’s” (That’s one of these places where all the high school kids hang out, like
“Hart’s Malt Shop” back home) for a milk shake to fortify us for the afternoon. It was pretty nice in there, sort
of like being a football hero again the way all those young girls were looking at us, so we. took our time and hung
around for a while. Telling an elderly lady about my plans for the future. We left Sweeney’s at about 1700 and
went out to see some of the sights of South Bend.
After walking around and just looking things over for about half an hour, we went into the Stratigon, which
specializes in palatable dishes and had a really good steak dinner. That was probably the best part of the whole
evening, eating that delicious meal. Of course, it would have been a lot better to have had you there, but we’ll
just have to dream about things like that.
■After dinner I left the other three fellows, as they had dates, and went up to the Service Center to watch the
dancing. Standing there, watching all those guys and girls enjoying themselves out there on the dance floor really
made me miss you. I’ll have to admit that the temptation to grab one of the hostesses and do a little rug-cutting
myself was pretty strong, but the thought of you was enough to keep me on good behaviour. However, after about
. an hour I did run into an old Navy friend that I’d met at the Air base in Dallas and we had a swell time talking.
about mutual friends and old times. It was pretty crowded and noisy up at the center, so at about 2100 we wan-
. dered down to the park and shot the breeze for a long time. Needless to say, you were number one on our topics
of conversation. After we had just about talked ourselves out we went up to the Blarney Inn and had a couple of
cokes, then parted for the evening. By then I was getting pretty sleepy.
Since we have to be in our billets by 0100 and the last bus leaves for Notre Dame at 0030, I decided that I
' had better do some good Samaritan work and go hunt for my roomate as he drinks a little and sometimes forgets
he has to get back to the school. So, as much as I dislike going into those smelly, smoke-filled places, I started
making the rounds of bars looking for Jack. After trying half a dozen places, I finally found him taking it easy at
the Bowl-Mor, not at all worried about getting back on time. To make things worse, he had a girl with him who
had a pretty possessive attitude and didn’t want him to leaver her. It took quite a bit of persuasion on my part,
but I finally made them both realize that we had to get back so we started out the door. However, just as we
were leaving, ! ran into some of the townspeople that I’ve met up here and they insisted on holding us up for
another thirty minutes. We hemmed and hawed and tried to get the idea across to them that time was fleeing, but
they just couldn’t (or wouldn’t) get the idea. I finally told them outright that we had to be back in twenty min-
. utes, or else, so they very generously offered to take us out to the school. We wasted another ten minutes or so
saying good-night to them at the.car and finally had to run to get in before the 0100 room check. That was the
end of my “wild” liberty in South Bend.
' Well, I hope that you are how sufficiently reassured that your “Angelrpie” is really an angel aind will stop
worrying-yourself into a head of gray hair. Honestly, Darling, you mean too much to me to let another girl even
distract my attention. The way I feel about you I’d rather go to a movie or read a good story than go out with
, someone else. As far as drinking goes, you know I never touch the stuff. It always gave me a stomach ache.
Write soon, Dearest, at times when the going is rough your letters are all I have to keep my morale up. As
ever,' .	.

Into a mind filled with metacenters, vertical sliding wedges, coamings, and plotting
boards, one word infiltrates through the cobwebs of new found knowledge and blasts the
battered and .dazed Midshipmen into galvanic displays of hidden power, “Liberty!”
Tossing aside textbooks and breathing quietly when passing, the extra duty lists, they jam
the busses and fill the air with cries of “horizontal parallax be damned, it’s Saturday in
South Bend!” Five thousand mothers chain their daughters to the furnace, bolt the doors,
and wait with loaded guns for the week-end to pass. Liberty has come to Notre Dame.
Each week-end, like Theseus in the Labyrinth, footsore and weary Midshipmen trudged
through the winding streets of South Bend from Sweeney’s to the Emerald Room, swayed
back to the Stratigon, danced their way over to the Bowl-Mor, staggered into the Hoffman,
and here dozed peacefully on the upholstered floor before being poured on the 0030 bus.	|
Then too, there were others to “Hold down the Fort” at the Service Men’s Center; as well	|
;
as our lochinvars who strode forth in search of a fair damsel—Oh! Blissful youth.	I

A dance band sounds like something far removed
from the world of a midshipman, but snatches of
tunes emanating from- Morrissey ; Chapel several
days each week set all the hep-cats in that “makes.-
you-wanta’-dahce” mood.
The band was handicapped by a late start in
organization, t lack of practice rooms, and con-
flicting schedules. But it coordinated very quickly
and functioned like a veteran organization.
Under the direction of Lt. (j.g.) H. N. Duda, who
also doubled on sax, the band enlivened many dull
mid-week evenings for the Midshipmen on the
station.
Station activities also found the band bn hand to
keep the situation strictly on the “jive” side as the
band was one of' the main attractions for the
“Happy Hour”, given just before graduation.
The Midshipmen making up the band had a
collection of interesting backgrounds behind their
playing. Midshipman Runyon was. at one time a
featured trumpeter with Stan Kenton’s famous
band. John Welsh, also of the trumpet section,
was leader the of dance band at his V-12 school.
Midshipmen Caskey, ’ Gilman, Goodwin, Farwell;
and Campbell had all had experience in both
civilian and other Navy bands prior to coming to
Notre Dame. The band was as truly cosmopolitan
as it was good.

[198]
. Probably the most outstanding extra-curricular:
activity of the Class VII Midshipmen was the
Midshipman Choir of approximately fifty voices.
Appearing over the air on Station WHOT, at
various churches in South Bend, at the Happy
Hour, at all formal exercises, and every Sunday
evening at the divine services held in the Drill
Hall, these Midshipmen added to their own enjoy-
ment as well as to that of all who heard them sing.
This Choir, for it actually was a choir in every
sense of the word, was probably the best to come
from the Notre Dame Midshipmen School. It
rendered a variety of muscial numbers,. ranging
from-the traditional Navy Hymn, to the beautiful
Bortniansky’s “Churubim Song”; with negro
spirituals, sea chanties, and well-known religious
anthems thrown in for good measure.
For the full 16 weeks the Choir was under the
direction of Midshipman Robert W. Leppien.
Midshipman Leppien had experience at directing
church choirs and his college glee club, and sang
with the Bluejacket Choir from Great Lakes.
Three men were featured as soloists with the
choir, Midshipman E. N. Doe, G. E. Jackson, and
the director, R. W. Leppien. Midshipman J. N.
Grabner was the pianist until Class XI-S gradu-
ated, the job then fell to Ensign Donald Irving who
from the beginning was the officer in charge of the
choir. To Ensign Irving goes the credit for the
choice of music, the spirit of the club, and the
enjoyment the members had while singing with the
group. A fine job well done.

IN the forbidding tropical under-
growth of the Pacific islands,
Studebaker’s amazing new Weasel
personnel and cargo harrier is now
in. action with our armed forces—
advancing, as it has been doing in
Europe, over terrain that seems im-
possible for any mechanized mili-
tary vehicle to negotiate.
Designed to glide forward swiftly
and stealthily in mud and swamp as
well as on sand and snow, the
Weasel floats like a boat in lakes and
rivers, as its powerful Studebaker
Champion engine propels it from
shore to shore.
This new “Champion” in invasion
warfare not only transports men and
supplies but also serves to carry
wounded back to hospital areas. It’s
geared to clamber up seemingly im-
possible grades on its flexible rubber-
padded tracks.
Built by Studebaker, powered by
the famous Studebaker Champion
engine, the Weasel is one of a num-
ber of Studebaker war production
assignments which include Wright
Cyclone engines for the Boeing Fly- *
ing Fortress as well as heavy-duty
Studebaker military trucks.

.Battling the sea with blasted hull and crippled gear,
many a wounded ship, has been brought safely into
port through the heroic efforts of its crew! Such a feat
calls for cool heads and fast work-—for skilled hands
and the right tools.
Fighting ships are huge machines composed of engines,
turbines, pumps, hundreds of: precision, instruments
and automatic controls, all of which must be kept in
order at all times. Maintenance and. repair are always
important. But when it becomes a case of "fix it or
sink,” grave responsibilities fall upon the ship’s ma-
chine shop. Tool equipment must be equal to the
emergency—accuracy and speed are absolute require-
ments. The Navy expects machines, as well as men,
to deliver unfailing performance.
It is significant that South Bend Lathes have been se-
lected for service in the machine shops on board many
of the Navy’s fighting ships. Providing these lathes is
one of our many wartime jobs.

THE MM WAR RECORD
Minneapolis-Moline is proud of its wartime record of achievement. As of
July 4, 1944, according to the best available information, MM was the first in
the entire United States to win all of the following awards:
?	Victory Fleet Flag and Maritime “M” Pennant (Minneapolis Plant}
now with five gold stars each denoting six months of high production
achievement.
Army-Navy “E” (Como Plant) to which two additional stars have
been added for continuous meritorious production.
Army Ordnance Banner (Minneapolis and Hopkins Plants).
As of above date, Minneapolis-Moline was one of 23 companies in the United
States to have earned five consecutive, awards from the U. S. Maritime Com-
mission for continued high quality and high productive achievement. MM was
one of the first 45 firms in the United States to win the Maritime “M” Pennant.
In addition, MM was one of the first 100 firms to set up a Labor-Management
Committee. The United States Treasury Department reports that MM was one
of the first 100 large firms whose employees invested 10%
or better of income in War Savings Bonds. For this,
MM proudly displays the Treasury “T” Flag. MM was
awarded the Governor’s Plant Safety Award for a well-
established safety program in every plant and has con-
tributed'regularly to the war production fund, of the.
National Safety Council to help prevent in-
dustrial accidents. Minneapolis-Moline and ' ’
its employees regularly support every worth-
while endeavor which will help bring final and
complete victory.

JT IS THE hope of Notre Dame that your training period on
the campus has been as pleasant for you as has been the
entire relationship of the University and the Navy. These re-
lations extend, officially, back to the inauguration of the Naval
R.O.T.C. unit in September, 1941. Unofficially, they reach
back to the Christian concepts of our country's founding fathers,
which are so completely in accord with the. spiritual, academic
and cultural objectives of the University. Notre Dame, with
your country and your Navy, is proud to-share, in a modest
degree, the reflected credit, of. your participation in the fight
to preserve these principles.
