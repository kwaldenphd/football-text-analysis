To Admiral Ernest F. King, Chief of Naval Operations, the second class
of the Notre Dame Midshipmen's school respectfully dedicates this book.
;zw»*

Today, May 27, 1943 more than 1000 midshipmen are being commissioned
Ensigns USNR. Way back in February when we emerged from the crowded,
tarpaulin-covered trucks we were ignorant and\naive to the ways of the navy; but
now, , we feel confident in the knowledge, we have gained at Notre Dame. After
wearing navy blue for four months it is not difficult to imagine ourselves as weather-
beaten and experienced salts who have stood our watches with the best. Yes, we
are really navy-wise.	• • .	•	.
'	But before any of us were born, or even anticipated for that matter, a young
man had left his home in Lorain, Ohio, and had completed four years at the Naval
Academy. In 1901, future Admiral Ernest J. King was graduated fourth in his
class of sixty-seven. His schooling was augmented by patrol duty during the Spanish
American War. The Chief of Naval Operations for World'War II was receiving
the foundations of his practical experience aboard the USS SAN FRANCISCO,
off the Atlantic Coast and in the blockade off Cuba.
The career of the Chief of Naval Operations is the embodiment of naval tradi- .	:
tion. In 46 years of professional experience Admiral King has been assigned to
every type of duty; from instructor at the Naval Academy to GOMDESDIV during
' the World War; from Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief, Atlantic
Fleet, to COMSUBDIV; from Commander of the USS LEXINGTON to Chief
of the Bureau of Aeronautics. .
Notable among his assignments was that to a submarine division as command-
ing officer in 1922. A year later he was given command of the Submarine Base at
New London, Connecticut. And then to complete his education he went to Pensa-.
cola in 1927 where he qualified as a naval aviator.	.	'
In our civilian days we knew little about Admiral King, except that he was
Chief of Naval Operations. When we came to Notre Dame we realized that he
was the man who in the1 final analysis would decide our naval fate, and accordingly
a new interest in him prevailed. We read about him and Idoked at. his pictures .
and tried to decide for ourselves what he was really like. .	. <
We learned that Admiral. King is the possessor of the Navy Cross, won while
he was on Atlantic duty during the World War, and the-Distinguished Service '
Medal and Gold Star awarded “for exceptionally meritorious service’’ as officer in
charge of. salvaging. operations of the submarines S-51 and S-4. In addition to
. these, he has received numerous decorations which mark the high spots of his pro- -.
fessional duties.- .	-	1	■ . . '	..	/	'
Our Chief of Nava! Operations has had a truly glorious career and it will be a
challenge to us all to keep.faith with it.	.	.	:	'

. The task of transforming civilians—the attor-
neys, the musicians, the editors, the fresh-from-
collegc youth—into Navy officers equippe'd to fight
the most far-reaching war in history is no easy one.
To Captain Henry. P. Burnett has fallen this task.
And although this is but the second class to have
been commissioned at Notre Dame, we, as the
products of this transformation, will testify that
“Our Skipper” has fulfilled his responsibilities in
the finest Navy Tradition.	K
Born in Shelbyville, Kentucky, in 1893 Captain
Burnett entered the U.S. Naval Academy at An-
napolis in 1911. At 49, he can look back on more
than a quarter century of leadership on Uncle
Sam’s fighting ships—destroyers, battleships and
seven years of submarine duty.
Today Captain Burnett is concerned.with train-
ing officers for these fighting ships at a time when ■
the future of the nation may well depend on the
quality of such men.	•
For what we are certain shall be considered a
job well done—we salute “Our Skipper”.	-
To Lt? Comdr. Richard Wagner, U.S.N. (Ret.), the “exec”, fell the arduous
task of station and school administration.
That the administration was so efficient can be attributed to the fact that Mr.
Wagner was the newly appointed Executive Officer when the school was appointed
a Naval Reserve Midshipmen’s in October, 1942, and initiated .much of the pres-
, ent routine.	. -	. ■
A 1927 graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy, Mr. Wagner served with the fleet
in numerous capacities until he retired following an accident several years ago.
Recalled to active duty in 1940 he helped organize a New York Midshipmen’s
School. He was transferred to Notre Dame in September, 1942, one month before
the school was elevated from an indoctrination station.

Memories are the “riches” of life; impressions, fun and laughter, trials and tribu-
lations, associations; on these one builds character, citizenship and ideals.
Your course has not been easy. With backgrounds as varying as the elements
you tempted the “alchemists of old” to teach a PhD. the mysteries of cam thrusts
and metacenters, a Master of Arts in English that “b-o-a-t-s-w-a-i-n” is pronounced
“bosun”, a B.S. in Economics that.ground “taykal” should be moved, an M.A. in
Music that only “two guys” on board ship rate “whistling”. BUT we found that
with a little salt, lots of pepper, some vinegar and all spice, you’d throw in the grit
to make a potion that would knock Tojo and Hitler off the map any day.
As a “plank owner” of all Midshipmen’s Schools, it has been my privilege to
help thousands of V-7 college men become Ensigns. You’ve done us proud; the
only Reserve Officers with the Medal of Honor are former V-7’s.
As you leave today, I am leaving too for another job, but wherever we go the
officers of all the Midshipmen’s Schools will watch and pray with me for your sue-
cess. We’ve had our heroes in history—you men are making history now.
’ Good Luck and.may we all rally round “The Capstan” for the last “speed-run”.
Lieutenant Commander Richard Wagner, U.S.N. (Ret.)

Russians Dancing at 0555
Some day in the not too far distant future, many of
we midshipmen now at Notre Dame may be in very
tough spots as we pursue our naval careers.
Perhaps the situation may be a lonely life-raft
tossing on the broad Pacific, perhaps it may be just
a continuous routine of lashing winds, soaked clothing
and poor food,on a watered and trembling destroyer.
Nostalgia will assail us. We will think back on our
training at Notre Dame—our golden days ‘neath the
Golden Dome. Yes, we'll think back on many things,
among them these:
Up at 0550 and out on the parade for calisthenics.
Easily distinguishable whites were the uniform as
often-times the moon was hidden and starlight wasn't
sufficient insurance we wouldn't do deep knee bends
on another man’s stomach.
Jerseys were also worn so that men who sought
warmth by hiding in snowdrifts could be detected
and made to fall back in.
Birds, awakened in their deepest slumber, chirped
profanely at us and with soft clucking noises urged
their young to go Lack to sleep as we had never
been known to harm any of them.
After fifteen minutes of such fun we were dismissed
despite our protests for "just six more push-ups, to
make it an even hundred." As we ran reluctantly to
our halls, we gibed and catcalled the less hardy of
our shipmates who had frozen in a scare crow stance
midway in a jumping-jack.
Back in our billets we loudly agreed that the exer-
cise was the best thing in the world for us, meanwhile
making a mental note to stop in and see how much
our pneumonia had improved since yesterday.
Leisurely ablutions followed. With only four men
in a room containing a big wash-basin, it was a simple
trick to shave two at a time, and besides the onmi-
present wind closed those gashes quicker than any
styptic pencil yet invented.
Talking in ranks was prohibited, but few could
resist the temptation to conjecture what new goodies
were to be placed before us as we formed for
breakfast. Morning meals were so varied it would
be impossible to list this gourmet's dream come true.
Let it suffice to say that once in a while, not all the
time, mind you, we had cinnamon rolls and corn
flakes. Who could ask for anything better?
Familiar now to the easy-going pace, we lolled
over breakfast for six or seven minutes, until finally
the urge to clean up our little homes became too
strong and off we went to make things spic and span.
Class formations were a delight to all.
Instructions were exciting and informative. We
would sit entranced as our instructors dramatically
related how the firing pin impinged on the cap, or
how free surface effect was minimized by compart-
mentation.
After an hour or two of these intellectual pearls,
we would return to our quarters, and marvel with our
Checking Up on Our Pneumonia
[136]
The Kickapoo Valley Track Team
room-mate on-the clarity and cogency of the lecture.
As we crossed the threshold we saw we had
visitors during our absence. All left written evidence
of their presence, and if we only had a typewriter
on the desk, the scene would be just like a city
editor's desk ten minutes after the OWI press re-
" leases come in.
There would be a little note from the company
officer saying he had dropped by and would we
please come to his office and initial a demerit list.
There would be three or four official memorandums,
the most important of which told of the dire con-
sequences in store for any man found eating in the
public cafeteria between 11:30 and 13:30. One of
the chiefs, the MJOD and the OOD all wanted to see
us at once.
But before we could get off on these important
errands, the mate announced the uniform of the day
had been changed, we were to fall out in inside in-
formation immediately and the watch bill was to be
signed before noon.
Mid-morning marches from the classroom building
to our halls were the best sport of the day. Drummers
who discarded inhibitions and played "ragtime, jazz
time, swing, any old thing;" officers and chiefs lining
the walks to call encouraging "hip, hip" in practiced
discord, combined to make the return informal and
carefree. We were certainly the happy group as
we skipped back from classes.
After hearing the wise advice, delivered succiently
in half an hour, that all men should have haircuts for
captain’s inspection, we returned to our rooms and
awaited noon chow formation.
Afternoons were even better than mornings. When
we first arrived on the ship there was nothing to do
in our liberty period except have pie and coffee in
the cafeteria or, disgusted with inactivity, seek refuge
from ennui on one's bunk.
A month was all we could stand of that and finally
we prevailed on company officers to have an athletic
program instituted. Organized entirely on a "volun-
tary" basis, this athletic program enjoyed a huge
success. Even those individuals who were not fortu-
nate enough to land on one of the competing teams
asked that they be drilled for an hour just to keep in
condition. Their request was willingly granted.
Evenings, devoted mainly to study, had a touch of
sadness about them—soon another glorious day would
be gone and we would be that much nearer the end
of our stay in our garden of Eden.
When taps would sound we climbed mournfully
into our bunks, resigned to wasting more than seven .
hours in sleep.
So when that day of the life-raft or arduous duty
comes, and we recall that which has gone before,
we’ll finally pray, "this is bad, O Lord, but thanks for
letting us see that things could be worse."

DRUM AND BUGLE CORPS
That extra something at chow formations—call it
military smartness, the added snap in our marching—
was furnished by the Drum and Bugle Corps.
Organized by Bandmaster Richard Tainter, the
corps started playing one week after the indoctrina-
tion program began and was soon established as an
integral part of the campus routine. The corps also
furnished the chief attraction for hundreds of Notre
Dame students and visitors who crowded the chow hall
entrances each evening to watch formation and to
hear a Navy band play with all dignity a tune whose
more popular lyrics start "You’re In The Army Now".
Midshipman Fred Graff, who directed the band at
Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh before
he came to Notre Dame, directed the corps of 30
musicians—buglers, drummers and three trombonists.
Came pleasant weather and outdoor Captain's In-
spection. The drum and bugle corps then made it
easier for midshipmen to stand "at attention" while
their shoes and haircuts underwent careful scrutiny.
[159]
HAPPY
"I was hanging'by my toes from a .yardarm taking
blinker at 50 words a minute".
The speaker was'an apple-cheeked midshipman,
promiscuously promoted to a double striper and the
listeners—more than 1500 strong—fairly rocked the
Drill Hall in unrestrained delight as this salt from the
shores of dear old Cripple Creek, Colorado, ex-
pounded on the dangers of the high seas and "Why
you birds gotta learn your blinker".	'
But it was all in fun. It was the "Happy Hour” show
—two hours packed with music, swing and burlesquish
drama that had officers for the villains and was com-
plete in everything but "Hearts and Flowers".
By its program containing no less than 22 acts,
"Happy Hour" had all the appearances of a loose
get-together, a mixing up of all kinds of talent; but
it ended as a well-knit, hilarious comedy with generous
portions of "good" music by the Captain Burnett Choir
and solid jive by the Midshipmen’s Jam Band.
High point of the comedy was "Sweeney’s Sham-
rock". _ The stage was rigged with a bar . and two ,
midshipmen whose imitations of two of the better
known officers of the school were about as subtle as
HOUR
a 16 incher on a battleship—but twice as funny.* The
Sweeney number was written by Wilbur Stegman who
clinched his composing talents a few minutes later.with
a rendition of his self-written "Cactus Jack".
Almost anti-climatic (but still thoroughly enjoyed by
all) was the sad satire entitled "A Midshipman's Mid-
summer Night’s Dream”, "Red Rommel, the Fox", or
"The Howards and the Virginian". A midshipman was
peacefully awakened at 0900 by a buxom house-
maid armed with a breakfast menu and the latest
comic book—to make sure he maintained the highest
literary standards, no doubt.
A more likely situation came about, however, with
the entrance of the company officer, decorated with
a wide yellow stripe on his sleeve, an alarming shock
of red hair, and a Southern accent that smacked
suspiciously of New England. The dream scene was
polished off with another of Midshipman Stegman's
ditties, "Mistefer Reed", written too late to appear
on the written program but ranking with "Cactus Jack"
as one of the show's high spots.
The twelfth company's contribution to "Happy Hour"
was "The Batty Office"—scene, Any Old Battalion
[160]
Office and time, any old time. Featured in this skit
were Midshipman Pooshups, Midshipman Shots and
Murderous Midshipman, who had been the ungrateful
recipient of a room slip—("room in gross disorder")
because his roommate's shoe lace was found hanging
from a shoe.
Midshipman Dale Richards was in charge of the
dramatic groups for the show and Midshipman John
Shaw combined the duties of master of ceremonies
and first baritone of the midshipmen's quartet. Stanley
Sandberg and Roger Spross headed the production
staff.
The show was directed by Ensign G. A. Hardy, who
with Midshipman Berl Olswanger created a few popu-
lar specialty numbers for the jam band including
"Spotlight Bands", an excellent imitation of the musical
themes of several of the nation's leading swing
organizations.
Ensign Hardy also. directed the Dramatic Club
whose crowning achievement was Clare Boothe's three
act play, "Margin For Error" which was presented at
Washington Hall on May 24 and 25. Midshipman
Gale Richards, who figured prominently in the “Happy
Hour" show was president of the dramatic group.
[161 ]
CAPTAIN BURNETT CHOIR
The midshipmen heard them for the first time at the
"Happy Hour" show. But for months the Captain
Burnett Choir had been well-known to thousands of
residents of the Northern Indiana district by virtue of
weekly broadcasts over South Bend station WSBT.
These broadcasts have given the school an enviable
reputation in things musical and have provided choirs
. of future classes with a real mark to shoot at.
Leader of the choir was Robert Sprecher, formerly
tenor soloist for the St. George Episcopal Church in
New York. Donald Jones, assistant, was president of
the Dartmouth College Glee Club and was baritone
soloist for the choir, while Wilbur Stegman, a Kansas
product, handled many of the tenor solos.
The broadcasts were announced by John Shaw and
scripts were handled by Stanley Sandberg.
[162]
SWING
Closest link to civilian life of all midshipmen activi-
ties was the Midshipman Dance Band, known less
formally around the station as the "Jam Band".
The band started as a five-piece unit but soon de-
veloped into an organization of’thirteen pieces—four
sax, four bass, four rhythm and leader Ensign G.A.
Hardy.
The band gave informal "sessions" each Friday
afternoon at Morrisey Hall and at the station dances
BAND
earned itself the reputation for being the best swing
outfit in the vicinity.
Feature of the band was pianist Berl Olswanger
who was a member of George Olsen’s band before
he enlisted. Other members of the band, who also
hqd professional "swing" experience before joining
the Navy,^ were midshipmen Szura, Fribourghouse,
Buccello, Jackson, Bauer, Faucette, Campbell, Daly,
Graff and Sybil.

I
SPORTS
The time was 1630.
We had our feet comfortably plopped on our
desks and were enjoying our first cigarette in hours
when "that bell" rang.	.
"That bell" usually marked a happy occacion, but
this time the mate of the deck sang out with almost
sadistic pleasure, "formation for voluntary athletics",
and wouldn’t we please hurry out to the parade
grounds. (He didn't really say "please".)
Most of us hurried to formation muttering uncom-
plimentary things about Mr. -Webster whom we felt
should get himself a new definition of the word
"voluntary”, but pretty soon we forgot all about Mr.
Webster's shortcomings, and before we could realize
it, we found ourselves liking this athletic business—
even if it was strictly "voluntary".
Some of us played a game called nucom, which we
learned, is like volley ball only a guy could break his
good right arm serving because this "volley ball” had
been stuffed to a 16 pound capacity. Morrisey Hall's
Company Five waltzed off with the nucom champion-
ship of the regiment by such a wide margin that we .
would have sworn Mr. Austin was proselyting his
athletes if we hadn't known that fris company, too,
was arranged in alphabetic order.
Mr. Austin’s boys from Five did a pretty neat job
in the basketball race, also, and scuttle-butt had it
that even the Notre Dame basketball coaches had
that hungry look in their eyes when they watched
Ensign Austin's five drub the boys from Company 9
in the final play-off at the field house.
Of course there were some boys who looked for
something less gentle than batting a medicine ball
around the drill hall or wiping the floor at good old
Rockne Hall in a hot company basketball competition,
and for such tastes, the program offered hors
d'oeuvres of touch football, a main course of boxing,
a generous sprinkling of wrestling and a dessert of
Judo, which made the old Jap past time of jui jitsu
look like a convention of the Park Avenue Boy Scout
Troup 77.
Came spring and we discovered that the Notre ’
Dame football team didn't use all 31 fields on the
campus for spring practice. Scene of our spring
workouts was the Navy Drill field which was just big
enough to make a guy plenty tired after he had
been ordered to do a length of the field for moving
in ranks. It was so big, in fact, that two midshipmen
who were ordered to take that tour first went to the
Navigation department for a pelorus and to the
dining hall for a packed lunch before starting the
trip. They never did get back.
But not all of us spent our time running around the
drill field. There were "A” and "B" leagues in soft
ball just as there had been in basketball, volleyball
and nucom. Rumor had it that midshipmen were
made eligible for the "A" team if they could run
around the base paths twice and still had enough
energy to march back to the hall—supermen all.
Then there was touch football, which, according to
the rules, was a lot like the real thing, but we substi-
tuted the Marquis of Queensbury rules—no fair kick-
ing a man AFTER he's down.
The prize for athletic stick-to-it-iveness went to the
track squad who first put on their running pants when
February snows still made the campus look like the
head on a beer_mug. Track squad coach was Chief
Tom Quinn, a track star in his own right and an opti-
mist of no mean proportions. Therein lies a story:
It happened on a Saturday morning when it was
so cold that even the sparrows hung around their
nests. Things weren’t too bright for the boys from
the first battalion anyway. They had only Captain’s
inspection and an ordnance exam to look forward to.
So with track star and optimist Chief Quinn leading
the way, the batallion set out on a cross-country
jaunt that routed back of the chow hall, past the
drill field, around the Notre Dame Stadium, and back
(as the order goes) on the double.
This little voyage was a substitute that day for the
. activity that was really the "cream" of the athletic
program—in popularity, at least. Morning calis-
thentics they were called—designed to build muscles
and to bring home the fact that all good little mid-
shipmen are out of bed at 0550.
That was our athletic program at Notre Dame. It
started out cit the uncivilized hour of the day and
finished on the lazy hour. But just between us—we
liked it.	_

LIBERTY
There was much of hustle and bustle in a first-deck
Lyons room that Saturday afternoon which marked
the end of indoctrination period.
Three of the four denizens of the oversize closet
clustered about the mirror preening in new dress blues.
The desired full length view was obtained by stand-
ing for the head and shoulders, and climbing succes-
sively on a chair and the wash basin to complete the
picture with- the midriff and lower sections. They
descended with "oohs" and "ahs" of appreciation.
Midshipman Blotz, the sartorially indifferent occu-
pant, sat on his bunk muttering imprecations.
“Classroom security watch from 2200 to' 2400. In
the whole weekend for a measly two-hour watch.
And I thought I was smart when I beat the draft."
While in this mood, Blotz rejected the half-loaf of
freedom offered him until 1930"and decided to eat
one of the steaks featured Saturday evenings.
Feigning deep concern, his roommates attempted
words of solicitude. Everybody concerned knew it
was just good form.
"Too bad, Blotzie, but as long as you're not going
out will you lend me five bucks.”
"That's tough, fellow, but you can look up our
drawing marks when you 'phone from the Ordnance
Department. You'll find them under the second
blotter, or in one of the desk drawers."-
The liberty bell sounded and Blotz found himself
alone with the mate, who eyed him suspiciously.
Blotz, feeling deserted, offered no information.
After evening mess he mustered.
“Ready to relieve, sir."
Listening patiently to the warning of the ASOOD
that saboteurs might strike tonight, Blotz thought:
"Whoinell would want to get in that place?".
At tattoo, mindful that a smart appearance is half
the battle with enemy agents, he performed the self-
improving ritual which was now a habit.
The night quartermaster looked skeptically as Blotz
reported, seemingly doubtful of his ability to tour a
building and use a telephone. Finally, however, Blotz
was accepted," entered in the log as Blottz.
The first tour proved uneventful as did all the others.
The only excitement came when the OOD, check-
ing on his watch, was heard crunching through the
snow a hundred yards away.
Knowing who it was, Blotz and his partner, one of
. the many Johnsons from Morrissey, decided to impress
him with their vigilance and skyrocket that aptitude
grade. They hid in the shadows until the victim was
within -six feet and then bounded out, bellowing in
unison:
"Halt, who goes there?"
After a few backward jumps, the officer recovered
his composure, and told them to carry on.
At 2400 relief came. Blotz happily gave his
lantern, nightstick and best wishes to his successor and
doubled back to his hall.
As he entered he heard the first of the revelers re-
turning and enviously listened to snatches of their talk. '
"When I ran across her at Sweeney’s she was
drinking beer, and then when she tried to switch to
Scotch, I said ..."
Blotz sympathized. Scotch on the dough you get
here!
Just after he turned in, one of his roommates barged
in, glad to find a pair of ears for his tale of woe.
"I was dancing all night with her at the Indiana,
see, and just as I was going to ask to take her home,
some ensign walks up with her coat, and says 'shall
we go now'?"
The other two entered just before checkup. Al,
the Kansan who affected a soft drawl when out in
company, screeched of misrepresentation on the part
of a young lady, who Cinderella-like, departed at
midnight with the explanation she was already late
for the graveyard shift at Bendix.
Bob, a married man, had little to say other than the
picture he took in was one he had seen before.
At breakfast formation, surveying a yawning and
red-eyed regiment, Blotz was convinced.
"Yeh, I had a fine time last night", he told his next
interrogator, "I was on watch—the best weekend *
I've had since I've been here."

INDIANA
The expression of individuality which we were first
allowed to exercise—without official disapproval—
was much in evidence at the “Get Acquainted with the
Navy" dance given at the Indiana Club by the U.S.O.
for the new midshipman class. All sorts of dancers
showed their skill. And no matter his ability each A.S.
reveled in the opportunity for relaxation and perhaps
a few mournful memories'of “civvies" instead of the
unfamiliar and uncomfortably warm G.l. uniform.
The Navy outnumbered the fair sex, which gave
them a chance to look over the field before braving
the swirling mass for the sake of closer acquaintance
with swaying hips and perhaps a provocative smile.
Needless to say, the Navy soon became acquainted—
and all too quickly it was time to join the struggle for
coats with others worried about the 0100 deadline.
Confusing memories of just how we managed to find
such a cute girl, and whether it was dll a line, assailed
us as we bounced out to Notre Dame determined to
take full advantage of our liberty “next time".
Armed with the self confidence of real Navy men,
we proudly escorted our dates to the next formal
dance at "The Indiana.” "Dress blues at last—this
will really be something!” we thought as we headed
for the nearest unoccupied table close to the refresh-
ment bar, after hurrying through the necessary for-
mality of the reception line.
A newer and better opinion of feminine beauty in
South Bend gradually eased out your previous doubts,
when your girl proved to be at least civilized and
you found she was good company. As the rust of
social inactivity wore off .on the dance floor you really
began to get in the groove and tried out some of the
old steps and flourishes.
Gold braid was much in evidence and seemed to
have the lion’s share of the beautiful gals, you mused
—looking forward to that great day when you too
would command not only men but also the admiring
glances of the fair sex. It was surprising that Mr.
------------- and even Lt. ---------------were human
after all and really seemed to be enjoying the dance
as much as you were. Most of your mates had
brought dates and familiar faces were everywhere
you looked—not many stags either.
The problem of getting more than one.drink an hour
without completely deserting your date was finally
solved when you discovered that a sizeable tip to a
particular waiter turned the trick. From then on it
was a struggle between a week-old thirst for liquid
refreshment and for a more intimate .acquaintance
with your date.
[190]

NIGHTS
An announcement that the "upstairs rooms" were
open suggested a reconnaissance cruise. It developed
that there was a relatively deserted club room above
with comfortable chairs and an adjoining billiard room
in secluded darkness. Just when you and the girl
friend had settled down in a corner of the billiard
room—"why do people want to play ping pong at a
dance anyway?" you said with a groan as group of
couples invaded the room and broke up your rendez-
vous with a dream.
Out on the dance floor again and swinging to a
catchy tune, contact with reality almost vanished and
before you realized it the dance began to break up.
Well, this dance had really lived up to expectations
and that rather indefinite desire for companionship
had centered on a particular individual.
Gone was the prospect of a lonely Sunday, for now
you had an invitation for Sunday dinner and an after-
noon alone with Sally. It hurt too, to leave her with
just a quick goodnight and rush for the last bus to the
station. But you looked forward to more good times
in South Bend with her—and hoped you didn’t hit a
watch many week-ends. The Indiana Club and Sally
were good fun.
[191 ]
A. $32.00 Question
RADIO NIGHT
Instead of being confined to their rooms to prime for
their weekly quizzes on this particular Friday night,
the midshipmen found themselves assembled in the all-
too-familiar drill hall. As if navigation, seamanship
and ordnance hadn't done a complete job of testing
them, they were selected as guinea pigs for some
kind, of a radio program—a quiz program it was,
when already the word "quiz" was appearing in their
young navy lives with disturbing frequency.
"Will you take your money or shoot the works?"
was the manner in which WGN's Johnny Neblett
opened the show. The response of a drill hall filled
to capacity with Midshipmen was a rousing "Shoot the
Works" and the 30 minute program was underway.
With this cue, two curvaceous young ladies, a blonde
and a brunette, took their mobile
mikes and began the process of
selecting candidates for the possible
$32Jn crisp cash. It was the regret
of the temptresses that "we can’t
hold hands with all these gorgeous
midshipmen at the same time". Of
course, with pay day a mere for-
mality, the $32 loomed as a small
fortune to the already quiz-filled
audience.
The questions, sent in by listen-
ers, were the essence of the unex-
pected so far as this group of oft-
questioned, oft-baffled midshipmen
were concerned and included everything from the
naming of news agencies to the selection of rhyming
synonyms for "chubby hubby" and "sassy lossy".
Nevertheless, the first contestant, a startled mid-
. shipman from Kansas City, was inspired by the young
lady who took station on his lap to the extent that
he came through with the $32 question. A third girl
then sauntered up with an armful of currency and
paid off on the spot.
Inasmuch as St. Patrick's Day was approaching,
a set of questions concerning the Irish had been
submitted. It soon became painfully apparent, how-
ever, that the midshipman selected to answer them
was not an Irishman by any manner or means. The
Irish in the regiment still maintain that the guy "must
have known” and that probably
the presence of his wife who was
looking daggers through the bru-
nette on his lap caused d lapse of
memory.
The principal shortcoming of the
quiz, of course, was that there were
too many would-be contestants and
too little time. However, according
to observers those deprived of the
chance of replenishing their coffers
were able to concentrate on their
seamanship and ordnance after-
wards to an extent that the con-
testants could not.
[192]
a
From Beethoven to Boogie-Woogie
CAVALCADE OF MUSIC
It was a miserable night in the opinion of those Mid-
shipmen from below the Mason Dixon Line as the regi-
ment mustered for its second USO show. They were
convinced that a snow storm on April 19 was unreason-
able, even in Indiana. The show would have to be
much better than pretty good to bring any pleasure
their way.	-
Whether these Midshipmen realized it or not, the
seven artists of the show probably were no more
grateful for the belated dose of winter than any one
else. However, according to Godfrey Ludlow, violinist
and master of ceremonies, the prospect of entertain-
ing a Navy audience overshad-
owed any depressing effect that
nasty weather might have had.
“Whenever we see Navy on our
schedule, we're thrilled", he de-
clared, "there's absolutely no
comparison between Navy audi-
ences and others that we’ve
played before on this tour."
The concert had been organ-
ized in New York in November of
1942 and had been on the road
ever since. They had played to
aviation cadets in Texas, the
army in San Diego, and blue-
jackets on San Francisco’s Treasure Island. In the
space of five months they had been received by
various crowds of service men in Oklahoma, Utah,
Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Nebraska and several
other western states. This was their 199th performance.
Other artists on the program were Cynthia Earl—
piano accompanist; Mary Gale Hafford, violinist;
Sergei Radansky, Russian tenor; Sigurd Rascher, saxo-
phonist, and Phyllis Olivia, Spanish dancer.
With all apologies to the more seasoned artists—
it was Phyllis Olivia, the Spanish dancer, who brought
down the house. Miss Olivia, as Irish as the shillalah,
hails from Long Island. From her
repertoire of swirling skirts she
brought forth native Spanish
dances and peasant ballet to
capture her first in popularity.
Midshipmen were of the opinion
that this dancer was both delight-
ful to look upon and possessed
of considerable talent.
With a touch of salt and a
flare of patriotism the program
came to an end with everyone
• joining in "Anchors Aweigh",
and “The Star Spangled Ban-
ner."

The Twenty-Eighth Studies Etiquette ' *	Posed With Permission of O.O.D.
1’94]
NAVIGATION
Navigation, according to Dutton, is the art of de-
termining a ship's position at any time and of con-
ducting a ship safely from one position to another.
That, however, is only Dutton’s opinion.
Midshipmen of the good ship U.S.N.R.M.S., Notre
Dame, embryonic navigators all, proclaim vehemently
that navigation is a subtle art of torture, designed by
some sadist, for the purpose of driving potential en-
signs crazy. And well might they have that opinion.
. Starting innocently enough with symbols of bouys,
lights, radio beacons and other navigational knick-
knacks, the course was well received by all. A stock
appraisal heard in the vicinity of the classroom build-
ing during the first week was:
"This is a cinch. I'm gonna hit it for a 4.0."
When a sufficient state of mental softness had set
in, the trap \Was sprung. Running fixes came out of
nowhere, Tide Tables, looking like a dime-novel, but
which require complete mastery of calculus and ana-
■ lytic geometry for understanding, suddenly became
the most important volume of the dozen texts issued.
And so it went. G.H.A., declination, azimuth and
"red right returning."	.
Not content with bewildering midshipmen with as-
sorted slogans and rules concerning the franchise
priveleges of those deceased, instructors made doubly
sure of their prey on P-work days by assigning a list
of necessary equipment which only took from reveille
until 0953 to assemble.
Usually the.first ten minutes of an examination were
spent recuperating from the fatigue which resulted
from carrying Bowditch and all his associates smartly
under the left arm.	.
Typical P-work.was a serial account of the adven-
tures, meanderings and hopes of the U.S.S. (censored),
which erratically steamed at ten, twenty and 27.9
knots on wild courses that delighted the fanciful mind
of her bibulous master.
A cautious navigator, despite tippling, he was con-
stantly determining his position, the sun’s G.P., and the
bearings of Barnegat Light at 30 second intervals.
All to no avail. After every exam midshipmen would
angrily exclaim:	'
"The goofy so-and-so went right over Long Island.
What does he think he’s in, Amphor?"
Patience and understanding of the instructors was
a by-word among the halls. Smiling kindly they
would enter the room and blandly ask if there were
any points bn the day's assignment they could clear
up. Deluged with questions, they picked the cream
and gave the inevitable answer:
"We'll take those up in a few minutes, but first
break out paper arid pencil for a little quickie—just
to keep in practice, heh heh."
As the term drew to a close, a marked discontent
was noted among the fledgelings. They were tired
of expending all their energies and wasting their
talents on the second deck of the classroom building.'
They longed for the real thing, to see old Barnegat
herself.
Perceiving this feeling, one instructor, never known
to ladle out praise without cause, and for that matter,
never known to ladle out praise, finally broke down
and paid his group a tribute.'	.
"You fellows are going to be quite a surprise to
the fleet.: Why, from what I've seen here, you're go-
ing to be able to show these old-timers methods of
navigation they never dreamed existed."
And we surely will.

SEAMANSHIP
Far from the smell of salt air and the sound of wind
through the riggin', Midshipmen at Notre Dame learn
the trade secrets of mariners in an all-purpose course
entitled Seamanship. Anything that isn't included in
any other course at the Midshipman school will turn
up invariably under Sea.	.
Public enemy of the course is the blinking infernal
machine above the blackboards. Here, Midshipmen
spent many a dazed and harried minute in-attempting
to follow the too fast blankety-blank blinks. Shouts
of delight sounded forth when the blinker went on the
blink. It goes without saying that Midshipmen are
suspected by the department as being responsible
for the aforementioned breakdown.
Blinkeritis is a peculiar disease, common in Seaman-
ship classes. Victims have found that they become
hypnotized by the blinker, and gaze in rapt fascina-
tion at the darn thing without so much as writing down
a single word or letter. This glassy-eyed condition
continued until instructors decided to collect the papers.
The tree has been found an excellent antidote.
Seamanship drills, held in Navy drill hall, will live
fondly in the hearts of all Midshipmen. It was there
that they endured some of the happiest hours while
at Notre Dame. There future ensigns learned the
ropes, and how to tie them. Each knot had its par-
ticular utility and it meant a summary court martial if
the knot were used for any other purpose. Time and
again an instructor, brandishing a knife, would wade
into a group of men knee deep in knots and cut one
of them loose from his own handiwork. Such is an
instructor’s cross.
Signal flags, hoisted in halyards throughout the drill
hall provided interest, even though sometimes unin-
telligible. Each group clustered at a particular flag-
bag would attempt to outrace other flag-bag groups
thus setting up a danger zone around any such group.
The-intricacies of semaphore were explored and
found, acceptable to most Midshipmen. Many of the
more advanced students sent such amazing signals as
Uncle, Roger and Nan without the slightest hesitation.
Some even tried figure 8’s, but by far the most popular
signal among all was the attention signal given at the
beginning of the message. Next in popularity was
the "front” signal which required even less effort than
the former.
Somehow that position reminded us of a fan dancer
preparing for her a-peel, and hot at all like a sema-
phore drill. But whatever we thought we kept to
ourselves, and raised our reluctant arms as the far-
away voice of the instructor droned on.
More involved than a simplified income tax blank
were the International and Inland Rules of the Nautical
Road. It all started when a staff of foreign lawyers
sat down in 1899 and decided how they would con-
fuse each other. The above rules was their answer.
Particularly painful were the lights required for the
various types of vessels, underway, with way on and
not underway. It had been suggested by a certain
Midshipman in a quiz that a vessel with all green
lights was a Christmas tree. Another, when seeing
two red lights in a vertical line called it a stop sign.
Topic of many a lush pun were the "black balls or
shapes" as displayed by vessels in various stages
of undress.
Although the pathe through Seamanship waters had
many an obstruction buoy in the way, we managed to
navigate safely.
DAMAGE CONTROL
' i	’ ‘
■J ■	'
>	A part of the training at any midshipman's school is
:	concerned with the four requisites of a watch officer,
i	The first and most important of these is forehanded-
. i.	. ness. Now if, dear reader, you wish to retain your
j	confidence in the practical results of being forehanded
J	then you should read no further and turn to the next
•'I	page.
1	The following story as told by an officer of the
J	_ navy cannot be questioned. It is about that same
.'i	_ officer, and for the sole purpose 'of enlightenment
rather than entertainment. .	•
•j	The story has its real beginning on May 27, 1943/
H	when a fellow named Blotz was commissioned Ensign,
!;	DV-(G), at the naval training school, Notre Dame,
f	' Indiana. In the four preceding months he had under-
'	gone the marked transformation from civilian to
naval officer.
; .	Now, eight weeks later, Mr. Blotz was on the bridge
■	of (destroyer No. 333 standing his first watch as
i	O.O.D. It was in those quiet hours just after midnight
' and he was mentally engaged in determining his
actions should his ship suffer damage below the
?	waterline. Just as he had been instructed to do at
Notre Dame, he was spending his less busy moments	j
anticipating any mishap.	'
The forehanded Ensign Blotz imagined two compart- '	■
ments flooded by water from a gaping hole in the
hull, port side and a few feet forward of the raft body.
It was a wonderful hole to practice with because it
gave Mr. Blotz an opportunity to drag in all his
knowledge of damage control, every effect of flood-	j
ing, principle, and formula that had made his four
month cruise through Notre Dame a stormy one—that	i
is, every one which he could remember.	।
. “The first things to do,” he thought, "are to establish	■
the flooding boundaries and to determine the weight	j
of the flooding water. But then, it would be easier
to determine the flooding boundaries because, as I -
remember that damage controfcourse at Notre Dame,
there are no formulas involved. But I wish I had
Plate II, you’ll remember Plate II, to calculate the .	-
weight of water in those two compartments.
"To neutralize the effect of the flooding I could
pump the water out or shift weights, but either would	'
consume too much time. The only remaining alterna-
five is to counter-flood a starboard compartment near	.
the stern. But, hang it all, I sleep in the only available	:
space, the one on the platform deck just abaft the
engine rooms. And besides, I think the cook used our	!
last remaining fire hose to make stew for the crew
tonight.
"The only thing I can see is to plug the hole and
form a bucket brigade to get the water out. If this	■
doesn’t turn the trick we can always send out an SOS •
and take to the lifeboats—that is, if all of them weren’t
left ashore when the hull was conditioned for war-
time cruising.	.
"Oh, why couldn’t the Bureau of Personnel have
given me recruiting duty as I asked for back at Notre
Dame. After two weeks of damage control in mid-
shipman's school'I could have told, them that I would
make a poor O.O.D. They could have looked at my
marks and discovered that for themselves."	,
Thus ends the story of one brand new ensign who	.
attempted to put his knowledge of damage control to
practical use.	‘
If, after hearing this experience, you still think, you ’
can neutralize the effects of an underwater explosion,
then why don’t you drop around to my recruiting sta-
tion for a chat. !	_ '
You see, I am Ensign Blotz.
ORDNANCE
Midshipman Blotz dozed restlessly . . .
King Mark XIV, high regent of Firelocknia (latitude
and longitude unknown), straddled himself comforta-
bly on his mushroom stem and assumed his most philo-
sophic pose.
“I tell ya, boys, fame—it’s wonderful. It’s just like
I said all the time. All a guy's gotta have these days
is the proper publicity—and bingo, he becomes a
public figure overnight. Ya can't go half way on this
publicity angle either. Remember when that adver-
tising salesman from Naval Ordnance came around to
see me about buying some space in that big red book
of his. I could have bought maybe only one page like
that piker, Mark V, but not me, I’m smart. I take five
pages of pictures, and four pages of plates in techni-
color. Strictly Disney stuff, that technicolor, but it
paid off."
Now King Mark XIV was not a modest guy even for
such a finely-machined hunk of steel. So all this talk
caused no little disturbance to Prince Dimwit De Bange
who was trying to catch a few quick winks in the
next chamber.
"I wish you and your bunch of lugs would go easy
on the gas for a few minutes so a guy could get some
sleep. That's the trouble with you, Mark, too much
gas—ever since you got your picture in Naval Ord-
nance. What you gotta learn is to take your fame
in stride."
"Quiet, Dimwit De Bange," Mark answered, "be-
fore you cause a blowback. Just to show you who
really rates at Notre Dame Midshipmen's School, I'll
read you a letter a midshipman sent me, personal-
like. And he says he knew so much about me they
put him on some kind of a tree every week:
'Dear King Mark: (I want you guys should notice
how he says King like he's supposed to—that’s real
navy etiquette.) This letter is written in sincere appre-
ciation for all the good times you. made possible for
us during our three months course in Ordnance at
Notre Dame.'
'You realize, King Mark, that before we began
this course, none of us knew a 16 incher from a cap
gun. But pretty soon we learned a lot of things. We
learned that a score has nothing to do with football—
even at Notre Dame, and that they wouldn't serve
potatoes on a spanning tray—even with all the po-
tatoes we get at our chow hall."
"But you, King Mark, you’re different. None of us
had any trouble learning about you. It was just like
learning about Washington, Lincoln and General
Grant—pure hero worship. I’m sure, therefore, you
won't be surprised to note that we voted you official
"Glamour Guy” of our class. And you didn’t get that
honor because of your well-insulated firing pin or be-
cause of your super, super primer retaining catch.
No sir, King Mark, you got that honor because of your
lost motion spring. The sentiment was unanimous that
at Notre Dame where there is so little lost motion
(especially among the midshipmen) that we should pay
special tribute to a guy with a special lost motion
spring."
"I guess you've gathered by now, King Mark, that
we think you’re a pretty good guy, but we’re thinking
of the next class too. For their sake, next time you
send in your pictures for Naval Ordnance, could you
manage to lose the diagrams of about 99 relating
parts. It won’t make the midshipmen mad. No sir,
it won’t . . .”
ZING . . . Brrr-r-r-r-r-r.........
"Reveille! All hands hit the deck.’?
Blotz jumped. “What a horrible night!"
THOSE CLASS SCHEDULES
"Formation for the first period." "Second period
drill formation." Such were the calls which initiated
the train of events that began with grabbing for your
raincoat and culminated in receiving a work party for
J	scratching your ear in formation. The connecting link
between the two consisted of two mad dashes—one
:•	was down the eight flights of stairs, where it seemed
I	that every other midshipman was doing his best to
'	.	trample on your newly polished shoes; the other,
which was somewhat similar to an off-tackle smash,
J	was along the cement walk which led to your re- ,
;|	spective plan.
i	As you battled slowly toward plan No. 3 it seemed
ill	that the other 1037 midshipmen were bent solely on
ii	having you go with them to plan No. 1. If you didn’t
’I	mind picking up your books a few times or gathering
up the navigation equipment which some 200-pounder
i'l	had sent flying, then it can be said that you usually
]]	reached plan No. 3 with no trouble at all—just in time
.d	to see your section marching around the corner.
Then apparently to make things more difficult, a
new order was passed—"starting with the first class
j	formation tomorrow morning no midshipman will break
q	through ranks already formed nor will he run across
-the grass." It was really a very nice order, except
that it left us no path to run to plan No. 3, or any
other plan—that is if you discount the overland route
via St. Mary’s Lake.
!	It wouldn't have been so difficult had there not been
a three minute time limit. None of us could-see any
logical reason for selecting three minutes, instead of
five or. even ten, until we heard the story from a
veteran member of the ship's company. It seems that
a Fordham (or was it Slippery Rock) track star visited
' the midshipman’s school at Notre Dame at the request
of proper authorities. He climbed to the fourth deck
of Lyons Hall, donned his track shoes and got set for
a running start to plan No. 3. By stop watch his time
was 2:57. Because we had to carry Bowditch we
were given three additional seconds.
But these were only a few of the tribulations in the
daily schedule of a midshipman.
When we first received the schedule of classes,
there was great rejoicing over the ample number of
free periods. Some were happy because they saw
plenty of-time to prepare assignments; others, be-
' cause they recognized the chance to maintain their
civilian interest in current sporting news. Ah, yes—:it
was a fine schedule. All of us had three or four hours
each day in which we could do as we pleased—
we thought.
The first week we had to draw clothing and equip-
ment. Of course it couldn’t be done during class
periods, so some of us flunked P-works and others
found it necessary to Neglect their sporting page’s. It
was not too bad though because everyone thought
that after the excitement of the first few days, things
would quiet down and we would regain all those un-
scheduled hours. How naive and innocent we. were
to the ways of the navy.
Starting about the second week and ending during
our sixteenth week of naval training, various and
sundry formations were called during those periods
when we had no classes.
First there were shots. They could usually be
counted on to ruin about three otherwise perfectly
good hours. It would have been all right to have them
just before going to a class. But no, they had to be
given us when we had no other formations for the rest
of the day. We had to relinquish our free time to
overcome their effects.
Then there were battalion assemblies, usually called
about ten minutes after the beginning of the last study
period before a P-work or two. Most of them were
to instruct us in the correct manner of filling out official
forms previously distributed. By the time we had re-
turned to our rooms we had forgotten the numerous
instructions anyway. And besides there was that
P-work to study for. . So we hastily answered the
various questions on the form and dashed off to turn
it in to the M.O.D. If anyone was lucky enough not
to get demerits for making an error on it, then he got
them for omitting to write his room number in the
upper right hand corner.’ By the time'we had settled
down again the bell was ringing and the M.O.D. was
announcing “Formation for the seventh period." It
was then that we grabbed bur raincoat and fought
our way to join the formation that would take us to
the P-work we didn't study for.
[202 ]
BSBEHtt
And then one day at a general assembly an an-
nouncement was made. "On Mondays and Tuesdays
you are to attend the Washington Hall movies; Wed-
nesday and Friday afternoons you will have executive
during the first two periods (yes, we knew the instant
we heard it that we had P-works in the. last two
periods); and on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
you all will participate in voluntary athletics."
So it went—each succeeding week saw a diminish-
ing number of daily study and liberty hours. Each
week we realized how much free time the previous
week had afforded us, and wondered what new plans
were in store for us for next week.
More seriously though, a word of praise should be
given to him who devised the system that guides us
day by day. To have 1100 individuals in the right
place at the proper time eight different times a day
is certainly a feat to be lauded.
And we might put in a good word for those 1100
individuals,
too.

[209 J

We got off the train.
The little guy in the natty tweed topcoat hitched
his zoot pants and the fierce Indiana wind almost
carried him off his feet.
"Say, ’ya reckon it'll warm up a bit here. Man, I
ain’t ever been cold like this. How do you Yankees
stand it?"
The scene was the, railroad station in South Bend,
Indiana, where they have four months of White
Christmas and where sunshine is a military secret.
The "Yankee", who was such a big hulk of a guy
that it made you glad he was on our side when you
looked at him, half smiled.
"Dintcha hear, sailor? This ain't cold. They tell
me on the destroyers in the North Atlantic, you don’t
dare stop when you're walkin’ on the deck lest your
feet freeze right in their tracks. And if that doesn't
happen, when you get inside they have to douse you
with a bucket of cold water just to thaw you out."
"I ain't a sailor, yet," the little guy answered.
"Man, if it stays this cold, I reckon I'll plumb freeze
myself right out of this hyar navy. Why, just last
week I was playin’ golf in Houston with my sleeves
rolled up. That's weather."
Thus did the big guy and the little guy—the Yankee
and the slight Southern gentleman, see Uncle Sam’s
navy for the first five minutes;
But the next.five minutes was blackout, the strictly
non-military kind. The scene of the blackout was a
tarpaulin-covered stake truck that rattled plenty and
didn't match our new tan luggage. But it was marked
"USN” and the next time we saw daylight an officer
pointed to a snow-crusted dormitory and told us:
"Welcome, gentlemen, this will be your home for the
next four months".
THAT Fl
The face of the little Southerner plainly showed
disappointment. "Here I came all the way from
Houston to South Bend.. It's cold enough to be Alaska,
and I've been here for 15 minutes and ain’t seen one
guy who even resembles a football player”.
"Stick around”, answered the Yankee. "Two more
weeks of this weather and if you live, you’ll feel like
the Fifth Horseman.”
The conversation came to a sudden end when a
red-headed ensign who looked like he was covering
plenty of muscle under his bridge coat ambled over.
"Listen, Mister”, he addressed the Yankee (who
looked old enough to be his father,) "This is no tea
party. You’re supposed to be standing at attention
and there’s nothing in Navy Regs about lip movement
when you're at attention."
The officer turned toward the Southerner who had
his eyes shamefully glued to the sidewalk.
"And you, Mister,"he called in a voice that fairly
jolted our Dixieland friend. "Are you a cement ex-
pert? Get your eyes off the deck when you're at
attention. Let Uncle Sam take care of Notre Dame’s
concrete problems".
He was learning quickly.
He soon found out, for example, that the guy on
his deck who was bursting his lungs with notices
preceded by "Now hear this", was no relation of
Paul Revere. ‘ And when this same guy hollered “all
hands fall out immediately in front of the hall", our
Dixie pal knew this meant to line up, and to line up
in the navy means to do so with eyes open and .lips -
buttoned.
[210]

RST DAY
And without the common decency of telling us
where we were going, this ensign, who hod accused
Mr. Dixie of being connesieur de la concrete, said,
"Forward March” in a voice like he meant business.
It seemed we had marched hours and the campus
buildings did little to shield us from the wind. Suddenly
the stadium loomed up like the big huge saucer that
it is.	'
A smile, the first one in hours, spread over little
Dixie’s pan like a ray of Houston sunshine. "I told
you all they couldn't keep us here long without
meetin’ up with the football team. And they're
fakin' us straight into that stadium. Wonder what
Bertelli looks like?"
But before little Dixie could spell Kalamazoo, he
found himself in the stadium and in a little room that
looked not too much unlike the back room at Gimbel's
(Houston branch)/	.
Then the battle began. Little guy though Dixie
was he was able to withstand the barrages of socks
and underwear but he wondered at two articles of
clothing which he later found were "gear".
One of these articles Dixie held in his hand at a
comfortable distance away from himself because he
figured it might take a swing at him, and without
giving this officer the Southern hospitality of a salute,
he began his.plea.
“Suh", he said, "I’m Apprentice Seaman William
Jefferson Lee, and without taking the risk of exposing
a navy secret, I would like to know where we are
supposed to wear these?" .
’ "Step over into this corner," the officer said, "and
I will give you the lurid details." .
"First of all, you must understand that these are
.trousers, pants, or you might even call them dungarees.
Mr. Webster will tell you that such clothing is to cover
the lower limbs of your carcass with. In the navy,
we call them pants. There are 13 buttons on these
pants, but not because the navy could not get priori-
ties for zippers. Apprentice Seaman Lee, these 13
buttons are to remind you that we had 13 colonies
long before they ever thought of Texas. The middle
or Keystone button, you button first. That's Pennsyl-
vania, and as long as you've taken care of Pennsyl-
vania, you will not lose the other 12 colonies, but if
you don’t have all of the 13 colonies in place, you
will find yourself on report, for which we give no dis-
tinguished service medals.”
"Now, Apprentice Seaman Lee, I think you know
everything about the trousers. That other article
which seems to cause you concern is not a tossle cap,
it is a watch cap, and should remind you to always
keep that little grey stuff you have inside your
cranium on watch, on the alert.
That night Dixie lay in his bunk and in a slight
whisper so as not to disturb his room mate, he began:
"Deah God, this navy ain't such a bad place after
all. Ah guess Ah can get used to them Yankees and
if Ah try hard, Ah might even get used to this Yankee
weather—if they let me pull the watch cap ovah
mah ears.”
"But, God, if you should find a spare zipper up in
Heaven, put it in an envelope and address it ‘Ap-
prentice Seaman William Jefferson Lee, Sec. 45,
USNR Midshipmen's School, Notre Dame, Indiana,'
and drop it in the nearest mail box.
"Ah can sho use it." '

IN APPRECIATION
It is for you to decide whether or not. the efforts of our staff have
resulted in an accurate picture of our life during the past few months.
A few words thanking all those who have taken part in bringing this
class book to a successful conclusion is certainly appropriate—even
though inadequate.
We wish to express our appreciation to the officers and midshipmen
-of Notre Dame U.S.N.R. Midshipmen's School for their generous assist-
ance and constructive criticism. In our presentation of the work, worries,
and "welfare" of his midshipman class, Captain Burnett and Lt. Com.
Wagner and all of the battalion officers have been most co-operative.
Lt. Haralson F. Smith and Lt. (jg) Kenneth G. Pearce, the Capstan ad-
visors, have our hearty thanks for their generous supervision of our efforts.
Lt. (jg) Sprinz, Public Relations Officer, has been especially helpful
in the assembling of pictures, while The Notre Dame "Dome" has kindly
allowed us to use several fine scenes of the campus.
Ray Moran and Peerless Press for advice, guidance in editing and
for the printing and engraving of this Capstan. And Moffett's Studio ■
for the excellent pictures of officers and men.
The South Bend Tribune kindly gave permission to use reprints of
pictures from their pages.
In conclusion, we wish to thank all members of the Capstan editorial
and business staffs—writers, artists, photographers, advertisement so-
licitors, and editors—for the long hours unselfishly given to this record
of our stay at Notre Dame.

"A combination of circumstances makes the Navy unusually welcome
I	to faculty and students at Notre Dame. First, the record of Notre
i	Dame s cooperation with the armed forces in the Civil War, the Spanish-
|	American Warj and World War I makes her eager to be of further
;	service. And the bond thus established has become even closer during
|	times of peace. Now it may be said that the type of officers and men
J	assigned to the campus in the R. O. T. C., V-l, and V-7, are so repre-
•	sentative of the best traditions of the service that the units under the
j	command of Captain Henry P. Burnett and his efficient staff have been
J •	accepted as part of the Notre Dame family.”
I	Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C.,
