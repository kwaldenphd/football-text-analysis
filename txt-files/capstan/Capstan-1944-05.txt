We, the Fifth Class to graduate from the

cate this book to those former graduates
who have given their lives in the' service
of our country.
We further pledge ourselves to serve their,
and our,, country to the best of our ability.
Honorable Franklin Delano Roosevelt
President of the United States of America
Commander-In-Chief, United States Navy
IN THE future days which we seek to make secure, we look for-
ward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech ■ and expression—everywhere in
the world. t
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own
way—everywhere in the world.
The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world
terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every
nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants—everywhere in
the World.
The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world
terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point
and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position
to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor—any-
where in the world. ...
We are fighting today for security, for progress, and peace, not
only for ourselves but for all men, not only for one generation, but
for all generations. We are fighting to cleanse the world of ancient
evils, ancient ills.
—Franklin Delano Roosevelt, January 6, 1942
[5]
Il is a privilege to me, as your Commanding Officer, to send a mes-
sage of God Speed to you members of the -Fifth Class to graduate from
the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School, as you are
about to leave to take your places in our larger and ever growing Navy.
You will soon be fighting alongside of your brother officers who
have gone forth from this school. You will do a good job, as they
are doing, because you all have the spirit and the courage of Ameri-
cans. I know that when the report is made upon the duty you
perform in the service, it will be the same as that for your work at
this school, “Well Done".
Good Luck and Happy Landing.
J. Richard Barry
Captain, U. S. Navy
The naval career of Captain Barry, embracing
thirty-nine years in the service of his country, is
one of color and versatility including duty aboard
practically every type of ship under the American
flag and in nearly every water on the face of
the earth.
Captain Barry was appointed to the Naval
Academy in 1905 and upon graduation four years
later was assigned to the battleship Missouri. Later
he was transferred to the destroyer. Drayton and
then back to battleship service on the Navy’s first
dreadnaught, the Michigan.
During World War I, Captain Barry assumed
command of the Pampanga, a former Spanish gun-
boat sunk by Dewey in the battle of Manila Bay.
This gunboat was subsequently raised and placed
in commission by the U. S. Navy. After extensive
duty in China and far eastern waters, he was made
Captain of the Yard and Aide to the Commandant •
at the Naval Station at Cavite, P. I.
Later he served aboard another battleship, the
North Dakota, and from there was transferred to
duty with the Navy Department in Washington.-
His next command was the destroyer-Reno. Then,
after a tour of duty at Annapolis as instructor in
Seamanship and Flight Tactics, he served on the
staff 'of the Commander of the Train Squadron of
the Atlantic Fleet.
Returning to shore duty in Washington, Captain
Barry graduated from the Naval War College and
became executive officer of the light cruiser.
Trenton. In 1938 he was made commanding
officer of the Trenton after an intervening period
of duty, ashore as executive officer of the Naval
Training Station, Newport, Rhode Island. Under
his command the Trenton became the flagship of
the European Squadrdn. He came to Notre Dame
from Colombia, South America, where he served
for two years as Chief of the U. S. Naval Mission
to that country.
[9]
Good luck and God speed to you as you embark on a
venture with a Navy never more valiant or more glori-
ous. I feel confident that your contributions can only
be typical of its fine traditions and its great history!
T. C. Scaffe
Lieutenant Commander
United States Navy (Ret.)
Discipline tempered with justice and an under-
standing of the art of commanding men.'
That was our first impression of Lieutenant Com-
mander T. C. Scaffe, Executive Officer, when he
reported to the Notre Dame Midshipmen’s School
last March. Our first impression was borne out
by the future for Commander Scaffe “laid down
the law” to midshipmen and ship’s company alike
with a competence and fairness that won the ad-
miration and respect of the regiment.
Commander Scaffe graduated from Annapolis in
June, 1919, as a member of a World War I class—
the Class of 1920. His first duty was transporting
«	troops from France. The fall of 1921 saw his return
i	to Annapolis as assistant football coach. From
I :	1920 to 1925 he served on the battleship New
i	Hampshire, as executive officer on the destroyer
Flusser, and as chief engineer on the cruiser
Cleveland.
In 1925 Commander Scaffe served his first duty
as training school administrator when he and an-
other officer founded the first NROTC unit at
St. John’s College. This was an experimental unit
to test the possibilities and value of such training.
* Retiring from the Navy in 1927, Commander
Scaffe served as athletic director of Wofford Col-
lege until 1933. At that time he left Wofford to
accept a position with the Gulf Corporation in
Atlanta, Georgia.
With the approach of war, Commander Scaffe
was recalled to duty in 1940 with the rank of Lieu-
tenant. From that time until he reported for duty
here he taught engineering at the USNR school at
Annapolis and again acted as assistant football
coach during the four seasons he was there.

Largely responsible for turning raw recruits into
finished officers of the United States Naval Reserve,
the Executive Department of Notre Dame Mid-
shipmen’s School deserves no small recognition.
Although the company and battalion officers at
first sight appeared to be just so many whip-
cracking Simon Legrees, they gradually became
pretty tolerable chaps by the end of the indoctri-
nation period. And by the beginning of the second
term they became no less than father-confessors to
the midshipmen of Notre Dame.
Tougher than sharkskin and as painstaking as a
mother hen with an irresponsible brood were the
Executive Department officers. They drilled and
trained their sections, platoons and companies
through “Column left, Harch,” “By the right
flank, Harch” and all the intricacies of. the manual
of arms in the geared-up four months. The
Captain’s “Well, done” from. the regimental re- '
viewing stand was reward enough to the officers
who day after day directed and instructed executive
drill.
“Square that hat, mister,” and “Don’t edge up
on that pivot” were phrases which became quite
familiar to the midshipman. He “dressed it up”
and “looked sharp” and gradually assumed charac-
teristics that marked him as a polished naval officer,
as a result of his officer’s incessant instruction.
It was the company officer who was largely
responsible for developing in the individual mid-
shipman the traditional Navy qualities—loyalty,
discipline, initiative, reliability and spirit—which
make for good officers and good shipmates. The
executive department officers developed in the
midshipmen the qualities of leadership, being care-
ful that every man received training and experi-
ence in giving commands.
“Loyalty up begets loyalty down” is a shiboleth
in the naval service that could easily be called an
unwritten law. By their regard for the interests
of the men in their company, the Executive Depart-
ment officers imbued in the trainees a high sense of
loyalty. This quality will be retained by the
graduating ensign long after he has left the Notre
Dame Midshipmen’s School.

Hey Sir, where can we find the Navigation Tree ?
[29]
^avi^a tion
Navigation is the art of determining a ship’s
position at any time and conducting it from one
position to another, according to Dutton, but that
is purely Dutton’s opinion on the matter! In the
four months of running fixes, dead reckoning
positions, mercator charts, maneuvering boards,
tide tables, azimuth circles and computed altitude,
midshipmen at Notre Dame came to have various
other more descriptive and less complimentary
definitions for the word “Navigation”.
From the very first day when the innocent and
unsuspecting midshipman trudged off to Navi-
gation class loaded to the gun’nels with books,
tables, charts, small area plotting sheets and ,
plotting gear, he became the victim of a conspiracy.
Little did he realize, as his formation marched to
the classroom building, that for months previous to
his arrival the whole Navigation department had
been busy plotting against him. Reams of P-works
had been mimeographed; assignment sheets were
stacked in the storerooms as high as the national
deficit; maneuvering problems which would have
stumped the saltiest “four-stripers” afloat had been
devised; and, in general, instructors had racked
their brains for weeks preparing every type of
problem from the shortest great circle sailing
distance to Petropavlosk to the local hour angle of
Sirius.
This was the well ordered campaign of mental
gymnastics that awaited the navigation neophyte.
All the dexterity of a juggler on a tight rope was
required to avoid slipping 'on the icy ladder of
Rockne Memorial as he lumbered along as graceful
as a bull elephant, trying vainly to keep his armful
of books from slipping and trying to keep the com-
pass point Out of the anatomy of the fellow ahead.
It,was difficult to understand how a ship might
steam north in three different' directions at one
time. Yet there they were—compass north, mag-
netic north and true north. And deviation and
variation were not the only boogies to plague the
bell bottom lads of Notre Dame. In fact, navi-
gation appeared to be such a vicious cycle of errors
and corrections that even Diogenes with his lantern,
Alladin’s lamp and a ouije board couldn’t have
found the true course from Hens and Chickens
lightship to Sow and Pigs reef.
As he doffed casual tweeds for the Navy blue, the
young navigator found himself face to face with
compass error, gyro error, heeling error, clock
error, index error, watch error, refraction error,
dip, semidiameter, parallax, drift error, radio
bearing error, radius of visibility error, barometer
error, amplitude correction, altitude correction,
and, in fact, so many errors, he felt that navigation
had no truth in it.
Yet, in spite of all the resulting confusion, it was
surprising how quickly the young John Paul Jones,
who could not even pick, off a rhumb line on a
mercator projection, found the shortest, great circle
course from the U. S. S. Morrissey, fourth deck,
to chow formation in nothing flat.
Those midshipmen who came to Notre Dame
with the obsession to get a shot at a Jap were dis-
mayed to learn that the best they could ever hope
for would be a quick shot at Alpheratz in the early
twilight.
After his four months in Navigation at Notre
Dame Midshipmen’s School, the young ensign
felt quite competent to keep his ship off the rocks,
but dearly hoped his captain would hot require
him to plot running fixes against time. He could
still hear that dreaded, “Ten seconds to go . . .
knock off and pass your papers to starboard.”

Ordnance
One of the chief, sleep robbers for Notre Dame
midshipmen came in the form of a thick, red-bound
volume entitled Naval Ordnance, ably abbetted by
its partner in crime, Fire Control Notes.
It was ordnance that gave the midshipman that
blank, staring expression as he stood in chow lines,
mumbling the sixteen advantages of the Mark XIV
firing lock. It was ordnance that caused him to
miss “To the rear, Harch” in executive drill as he
pondered the seven structural subdivisions of a
turret. And it was ordnance that first made him
skeptical of the heroes in the State’s double feature
horse operas. How could the Lone Ranger , drop
an escaping horse thief at 500 yards with no re-
gards to deflection, drift, trajectory, horizontal and
vertical components, sight angles and the like?
Ordnance was full of surprises for the bell-bottom ,
lads of Notre Dame. The midshipman was sur-
prised to learn that a star gage had nothing to do
with astronomy, that small arms had no connection
with Saturday night liberty, that gas checks could
not be used in lieu of gasoline ration stamps, and
that a firing lock was not a wrestler’s pinning hold.
In the drill hall the midshipman got a first hand
acquaintance with torpedoes, mines, 20-MM gun,
40-MM gun, 3-inch 50-caliber gun, 5-inch 38-
caliber loader, Sperry gun sights and range keepers.
He will not quickly forget those long hours spent
in pursuing interior ballistics. Indelibly imprinted
upon his brain now are fire control definitions and
formulas which eternally escaped his memory on
one P-work after another. '
Fire control loomed like Nemesis itself to the
midshipman who stopped to draw a deep breath
after ordnance. It was a long step from common
projectiles to the Mark 37 rangekeeper and with it
came the realization that fire control was not just
so much pretzels and Hoosier on tap.
In his four months of middie training, the gradu-
ating ensign learned that to be a fire control officer
he must utilize not only the WOG’s “forhanded-
ness, vigilance, common sense and leadership,”
but a little responsibility and intestinal fortitude as
well. “Hang fire,” he came to learn, was the
greatest dread of the ordnance officer. When the
captain says “Open that breech, Mister,” he opens
that breech, Mister, knowing full well that as he
pulls on the lever and the Smith-Asbury breech
system begins to change the rotational motion to
translational motion, he may assume a motion all
his own-—straight through the nearest bulkhead.
All during his ordnance training one doubt had
harrassed the mind of the Notre Dame middie. His
fevered brain had probed the depths .of smokeless
powder, trinitrophenylemethylnitramine, cham-
brage, dual purpose gun mounts, the Elswick
interrupted screw plugs, frictionless bearings,
barbettes, radial-expansion, gun formulas, and
other such esoteric subjects, but still he had not
answered that one burning question. And he
restrained his curiosity until that final day when his
section filed into the classroom building for its last
lecture.
“You men have completed four months of inten-
sive study in the field of ordnance,” the instructor
began, “and you are competent to take your place
at any gun in your country’s Navy. Have you
any questions to ask as you leave this classroom for
the last time?”	.
His opportunity had arrived and the dubious
middie lost no time in snapping to his feet.
“Sir,” he asked, “is it true that the harder I pull
the trigger, the farther the bullet will go?”

Seamanship
menclature as Irish pennant, jew’s harp, Flemish
down, Spanish bowline, flying moor, norman pin,
Scotchman ring,, and wales planking.
Seamanship to the Notre Dame midshipman was
a maze of .corpen nines, rules of the road, running
bowlines, Knight's Modern Seamanship, and blankety
blank blinker. In the drill hall he was given in-
struction in flag hoists, how to heave a line, splice a
rope, walk a boat boom, send semaphore; and he
discovered all the intricacies of corpen, turn and
form.
As he began his midshipman curriculum under
the Golden Dome, the middie could have easily
felt that he had enrolled in a course in zoology when
he undertook seamanship. There was dog watch,
monkey fist, crow’s nest, cow’s tail, cat’s paw, camel
guard, fox yarn, horse latitudes, gooseneck, lizard
line, mares tail, pelican hook, rat line, sheepshank,
wildcat and a jackass. And confusing enough was
fish block, mackerel sky, perch staff and whale
back.
The midshipman could have as easily mistaken
seamanship for political geography with such no-
“P-works” and mimeographed notes were
omnipresent during the four months with a deluge
of questions to plague the waking hours of the
middie. “How often should the anchor watch be
‘ wound?” “Does the chain of command bear any
resemblance to ‘at short stay’?” “What is the
proper tip for a bell buoy?” “Would ‘broad on
the beam’ with ‘green over red’ indicate ‘sure
thing ahead’?”
Exceptions were found in the laws of general
seamanship. Consider the plight of the hapless
middie who, with a full comprehension of inter-
national and pilot rules and a firm conviction that
he was the privileged vessel, attempted to make his
way to Plan I. Despite his “one short blast
signifying intent to hold present speed and course”
it seemed that 1137 other midshipmen were bent
solely on herding him all the way to Plan III.
Here he concluded the General Prudential Rule
applied (along with a few shoves and body blocks).
International flags and pennants were a night-
mare to’ the average bell-bottom. “Sugar” and
“Prep” he always reversed/ And how could an
instructor expect him to remember “red fox in a
box”, “yellow dog”, “blonde in a blackout” for
Love, and “white on gore for pennant four”?
Orders to the wheel he invariably reversed in
drills and his commands to the annunciator would i
have caused grey hairs to sprout on his senior	/
officer. But in spite of his landlubber background	/
—whether he came from the Nebraska prairie,
Iowa corn belt, or metropolitan New York—he
emerged from the Notre Dame Midshipmen’s
School with a working knowledge of seamanship
and naval customs.	;
Moulding raw recruits into ensigns in the Naval
Reserve was a job which fell upon the Notre Dame '
seamanship instructors. Their success in the task
will be measured by the accomplishments and 'j
quick adjustments of the newly commissioned naval
officers whether ashore or afloat.

Indoctrination consisted of lines and projections
—imaginary- lines, phantom lines, hidden lines,
orthographic projections, isometric views and cut-
ting planes. The midshipman’s drawings were no
objets d’arte, but his work was incomprehensible
enough to enrapture any surrealist.
Later came other griefs—Diesel engines, steam
power plants, pumps, compression ratios, atom-
izers, critical speeds, splinter decks, compartmenta-
tion, access, stability and underwater explosions.
Such were the iniquities visited upon Notre Dame
middies in Damage Control.
In keeping with the tradition set by Farragut,
the * young middie soon adopted the admiral’s
“Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead” as his
watchword. Torpedo wakes and screaming Stukas
held no terror for the seaman. With his knowledge
of compartmentation, hull structures, collision mats,
armor, double bottoms and buoyancy, the gradu-
ating ensign felt he could have kept the Hesperus
afloat—with the aid’ of a slide rule, Archimedes’
principle and Plate II.
The science of Damage Control came into being
' with the advent of the Monitor and the Merrimac.
Little did the Civil War boatswain’s mate realize
that as he swung his sledge to straighten a sprung
armor pin aboard his “floating cheese box” he was
also opening up a new science which would plague
midshipmen for decades to come.
The days of John Paul Jones are gone forever.
No longer can any self-respecting captain lash his
sinking vessel to an enemy ship and storm over the
side to take her by hand-to-hand combat. Instead,
when his ship is converted into a sieve by enemy
gunfire, torpedoes and bombs, he must invoke more
dignified strategy and tactics to keep his vessel
floating and fighting.
Such was the problem facing Notre Dame mid-
shipmen as they undertook to master Damage Con-
trol. And even though a Mitsubishi plunked a
bomb right down his “Charley Noble,” the DC
officer was the man who must- meet the situation.
He might be asked to do anything from plugging a
Fire fighting and flooding received no small
amount of consideration in the instructors’ lectures,
movies and damage control drills. “P-work” was
a necessary evil that always harried the midship-
man’s week. Unpredictable was the word for them;
no one knew when they were coming and from
whence they came. They struck like Commandos
and wrought nearly as much damage. “What is
the difference between a ‘handy billy’ and the
campus goat?” “If a Light List is discovered,
should the navigator’s compartment be flooded?”
“What is the stability of dynamic curves found in
the South Bend USO?” “How soon after location
should a mean draft board be reported to the War
Manpower Commission.” Such were the night-
mares that ran through a midshipman’s mind.
Although the graduating ensign may have missed
the swashbuckling era of grapeshot and ringing
cutlasses by a century or two, he will find he faces
the same common enemy that his compatriots
found—the Old Man of the Sea himself.

Speculation ran high and scuttlebutt flew thick
and fast as the fifth class of Notre Dame Midship-
men School began to assemble during the first
week of February.
The new class was to be the largest yet for Notre
Dame. Most of the men would be from the V-12
program, with few civilians: Forty percent would
be from battle fleets asea (inside information from
a Wave in the disbursing office). Practically all
would be in the “general” classification and -the
class in its entirety would be’heading for amphib,
just as had 75 percent of the last class.
Such was the “straight dope” that the new bell-
bottom acquired from the fellow, ahead of him in
chow line, his partner on classroom security watch
and the seaman who occupied the end stool at
Sweeney’s bar on his first liberty.
Sun tanned “fleet” men from the South Pacific,
bringing with them citations and long months of
sea duty; civilians coming abruptly from a normal
life, homes, wives, to a new life of regimentation
and discipline; married and single, young and
mature, arrived; all with one object in mind—1 .
earning a commission in the United States Naval
Reserve.
From early until late the parade continued.
Assignment of alphabetized billets gradually or-
ganized the melee with the “specialists” in Badin
this time instead of Lyons. Confusing to the point
of perplexity for the assigning officers were 13
“Smiths” on the rolls. Even the Smiths were
confused.
Notre Dame stadium has. seen in its history
numerous spectacular phenomena, but nothing to
compare with the parade that emerged from the
Embarkation
Navy storerooms on those winter mornings. Loaded
to the “gunnels” with peacoats, raincoats, C.P.O.
-shirts, pants with those abominable 13 buttons and
other miscellaneous gear the seamen staggered back
to their billets to collapse in exhaustion.
Inspections were a part of the life of the seaman
after a couple of weeks and continued with him
throughout four months whenever weather per-
mitted. Room inspection or personnel inspection,
either could (and did) add up demerits.
The strength tests which greeted arrivals were
[216]

and ^ebarlcation
merely a prelude to the long-to-be-remembered
two hour periods which succeeded—calisthenics,
road work, “butts and muzzles”, and mass swim-
ming tests.
Watches came and watches went, but AMOD
seemed to last forever to the apprentice seaman
just becoming acquainted with the discipline and
responsibility required in the midshipmen school.
As thorough as a Bureau of Vital Statistics report
were some of the questionnaire forms Notre Dame
midshipmen filled out. Some were complete to the
point of revealing skeletons in the family closet.
Others were personifications of brevity.
But regardless of the length they had one com-
mon theme, a flair for the absurd. Credulity may
be the downfall of the Capstan, but according to its
Questionnaire staff, Notre Dame had among its
midshipmen some personages of no little distinction.
And that first personnel inspection 1 Rigid arms,
apprehensive faces, last minute flecking of imagi-
nary bits of lint, quick rubbing of already gleaming
shoes on the back of well-brushed trouser legs.
After five days of intense study, continuous pres-
sure, the ever-present quickies and P-works each
week, the middie began to regard liberty as a
rather vital commodity. South Bend’s Service-
men’s Center, dances, movies, the Oliver, Sweeney’s
and other recreational facilities gave him the needed
relaxation to return to his billet at 1800 Sunday
for five more days “on the rockpile.”
Despite the assertions to the contrary, the first
four weeks flew with startling speed. Then came
the sleep-disturbing indoctrination finals—dots and
dashes, sea frontiers, BuPers, signal flags, dog
legs, danger angles, calibers, black powder, iso-
metric view and dimensioning . . .
As any graduate would agree, his first “pay day”
was a misnomer. The day was on the eve of be-
coming midshipmen. The amount was $45. Ten
steps, beyond the paymaster’s desk deducted five
dollars for laundry. A few more steps (already
slower)—twenty dollars for the tailor. Insurance—
$19.50—or didn’t you pay all of yours either? The
net, needless to say, was negligible.
A brief, impressive ceremony in the Drill Hall
at which nearly 1000 apprentice seamen became
[217]
“gentlemen by the act of Congress” climaxed the
four weeks of indoctrination for Notre Dame
trainees, March 4.
And March 31 rolled around—graduation day
for the specialists—shiny gold braid in abundance.
Proud parents and prouder sweethearts and envi-
ous looks from still struggling generals.
It was snowing again as the second class of
specialists arrived—most V-12s this time, with the
balance from civilian life. Seasoned generals were
prolific with advice and admonitions.
Then Easter arrived. This old world was turn-
ing after all. Another week later found midship-
men cramming for mid-term exams. Only 47 more
days ... 40 more . . . 30 . . .
Anxiety arose and now the middies began to
count the days, then the hours, minutes, seconds,
until noon, May 31 ... 20 days, 4^80 hours, 28,800
minutes, 1,728,000 seconds (59 meals) ... oh boy,
oh girl, oh happy day!
And with a rush the last 10 days arrived. More
cramming for more exams and more bilgees. There
were more queries brought on by the proximity
of graduation. “What type of duty will we draw?”
“When will our orders arrive?” “How many days
leave will we get?” .
Then the great day arrived. Officers’ whites
were donned for the graduation ceremony. Wives,
sweethearts and parents arrived by the dozens. It
was truly a great day for the neophyte ensign.
In four short months he had learned a lot—not
so much about navigation, ordnance, seamanship
and damage control perhaps, but a lot about the
Navy way and naval traditions. And so another,
the fifth, midshipmen, class leaves Notre Dame,
braid glistening and tickets in hand—with countless
experiences to recall, but more to look forward to.
[218 ]

[219]
A day was only a day back in those musty days
of memory when midshipmen school was something
associated only with Annapolis. After getting to
USNRMS, Notre Dame, however, the middie
learned just how long a day can be and just how
much activity could be packed into a twenty-four
hour period.
Twenty years from now he will have forgotten
the monotonous grind of life as a midshipman.
“Now hear this!”, “Chow formation” and other
familiar phrases will just be memories, but memo-
ffouglt
wide awake and commenting bitterly on certain
people and their questionable ancestry.
0202—Fifteen minutes late logging in? Sorry
mate—must have overslept—All secure?
0203—Logging in as security watch. Heard
scuttlebutt that a surprise night fire drill was in the
offing. Madly scanned through Fire Bill. Let’s
see—immediate action, alarm boxes . . .
0230—All secure.
0330—Woke relieving watch, making very cer-
tain that relieving security men were awake.
0400—Finally relieved after having had to re-

0402—Logging out for more sack time.
0403—Oblivion—nightmares of landing craft
with long tentacles . . . “It’s a good duty—spot
promotions and rapid advancement . . .”
0600—Strange foreign noise sounding vaguely
like the chimes of Hades. “Oh God, it can’t be—
Shut off the alarm, dear. I’ll be right up.”

was still in that sack? Why I was just looking for
my slipper that dropped down behind the bedpost.
What, sir? Name and room number . . . report?

razor blade. Hiding it behind a dusty Bluejackets

ries never to be forgotten. His life at Notre Dame
was haunted by time and logs. He logged any-

sparkling scotch and sodas ...

located prized possessions with the ease of a
bloodhound.
0629—Sweeping out billet, tying tie, and getting
peacoat on, all in one motion.
0631—Returned to billet to locate white hat—
uniform of the day having been changed with-
out notice.
0634—Made chow lineup just in time to catch
the “Regiment, Battalion, Company—Right or
Left.” Received long verbal lashing from com-
pany officer as a result of being late for chow for
the third straight morning. With the familiar
words “considah yo’self on ree-poat” still ringing
in both ears, company shoved off.
0710—Having shoveled down the last of the corn
flakes, made way back to billet.
0715—Uniform of the day changed to Midship-
man caps with covers and rubbers-if-you-have-
them, as a result of violent blizzard now blowing
in from two points abaft Rockne Gym.
0718—Made beds. Dusted room, cleaned mirror

mate’s wash cloth.
0735—A 'Mustang? . TBF? Ready-now-zzzt.
“All right we’ll slow it down to a 75th this time to

0830—The “salty” class. As usual, couldn’t find
pencil and missed half of daily blinker session.
Didn’t get second half either after locating pencil.
As usual, attributed zero to poor sending.

Golden Gate Bridge. Took a running fix on' a
lighthouse bearing 070 with alt. qk. fl. ev. sec. hd.
rsvp pdq—which, to the nearest tenth of a mile,
placed ship at the corner of Hollywood and Vine.
Sensing the probability of an error in calculations,
back-checking revealed apparent lighthouse was a
spotlight on MGM set.. Realizing the utter hope-
lessness of the situation, gave the order to “abandon
ship” and took to the lifeboats thereby simplifying
the whole situation and insuring a 4.0 for the day.
1036—Arrived back in billet to find roommate
sobbing violently over a room slip containing four
bright red checks. Offered consolation by remind-
ing him that I would be free on Saturday afternoon
and would be only too glad to take care of his
girl friend for him.
1050—Uniform of the day changed back to pea-
coats and white hats. Sun now shining brightly
with temperature around seventy.
1105—Mail call brought only the weekly Church
Bulletin. Commented bitterly on the unfaithful-
ness of the women back home and resorted to read-
ing roommate’s daily billet doux over his shoulder.
1135—Racing down aft ladder after chow bell
rang nearly resulted in loss of right arm in the
usual mad scramble to cram three hundred mid-
shipmen through a six foot opening. Succeeded in
making formation on time despite stumbling over
the broken bodies of less fortunate mates, which
slowed up speed considerably.

utes, of pushups? Oh, my poor back!”
1330—Passed out in middle of 135th pushup. It
took two midshipmen to drag remains of bruised
and beaten body back to billet.
1420—Body just about recovered its natural form.
1422—Mate piped that company would fall out
for swimming at 1440. Suffered an immediate re-
lapse, but managed to crawl out of sack in time
to get to formation.
1450—’Decided water polo was much too strenu-
ous a game and acquired a convenient cramp in
right leg. Act proved realistic enough to merit a
rescue by a pool guard. The game looked much
more entertaining from the safety of a wall bench
and, in the sadistic delight of watching other mid-
shipmen getting half drowned, the cramp was
forgotten.
1600—Afternoon mail call brought a letter. The
excitement over such an unusual event was short
lived when letter turned out to be a sweet letter
from Alma Mater seeking funds from, its alumni
for a new dining hall. Cursed all alumni associa-
tions bitterly and carefully tossed letter into waste
basket.	’	■	.

of straight 4.0 men about the bulletin board made
them inaccessible to those vitally concerned with
their contents. The four men who did not make
the D. C. tree were ordered to report to the regi-.
mental office to arrange for a discussion with
Einstein, Steinmetz and John Kieran.
1219—Uniform of the day. changed to raincoats
because of sudden downpour of Indiana “dew” in
king-sized drops.
1220—Fell out for “muscle drill.” Failed in
weekly effort to get excused from athletics because
of dangerous ingrown toenail.

world’s record for haircutting speed by fully 3-5
of a second.
1700—Special liberty declared until 0100 fol-
lowed by general shouts of joy and several caustic
comments by bitter men who were on the evening’s
watch bill.
1705—Had shower over, dress blues on and hair
combed. All set for a big night.
1710—Called Sally at S. B. 3-0837 and arranged
to meet her at the Oliver in a half hour.
1740—Should have been at the Oliver, hut some-
how found self in Sweeney’s wrapped around
Drewry’s finest.

before leaving to meet Sally.

Canadian Club for friend and self. Was glad that
Sally was an understanding girl who wouldn’t
mind waiting a little longer.
1900—Hitting on all fours on third chorus of
Mairzy Doats. Beginning to fear Sally will not be
happy, but went on to fourth verse anyhow. ■
2100—Got into a highly intellectual discussion
about Chaplin vs. Flynn. Now changed over to
“boilermakers” being donated by a gorgeous
“Studebaker” blonde. Sally now only a memory.

Cursed the fickleness of womankind, and resolved
to tell off roommate upon returning to school.

began to mellow into perfection.

toward even worst enemy and roommate gone.
0040—Just got one foot on last bus running board
before it pulled out. Had considerable difficulty,
in getting token into coin slot. This was of course
due to unusually bumpy road.

No part of a midshipman’s life at Notre Dame
will be remembered more vividly from his four
months under the Golden Dome than the athletic
program.
Moans and groans greeted the announcement in
February by Lt. A. P. Brown, Athletic Officer, that
“We have a tough physical conditioning program
here at Notre Dame. We’ll make you work off
those excess pounds.”
But four months later, after being commissioned
ensigns in the United States Naval Reserve, men
recall the strength tests, push-ups, squat-thrusts,
“double time” and sundry other tortures devised
by the “muscle” chiefs with pleasure. Physical
fitness took on an added significance in the life of
midshipmen with a report from Lt. Comdr. Louis
B. Benjamin (MC) USNR, recently returned from
duty in the South Pacific where he went ashore with
the first wave of Marines at Guadalcanal. Lt.
Comdr. Benjamin wrote, “Officers and men who
would better serve your country at home and on
foreign soilj prepare yourselves to be physically
able to do so. Regardless of the hardships involved,
the end justifies the means.”
To make the job of physical conditioning as
interesting as possible, Lt. Brown and his assistants
added to the basic exercises of calisthenics and road
work such sports as softball, touch football, soccer,
volleyball, boxing, swimming and a never-to-be-
forgotten obstacle course.
The program, beginning in February, was
limited to indoor calisthenics and road work due
to inclement weather. And those first few days
were the toughest, as any middie will vow. But
relief came from liniment, the arnica bottle, and an
occasional visit to Sweeney’s Shamrock.	•
A brisk run from parade formation to the drill
hall began each athletic period. In the drill hall
calisthenics began with the familiar jumping jack,
continuing through the various blood, sweat, and
tear stages with push-ups, sit-ups, squat thrusts,
four-forties, wood-choppers and any other muscle
building ordeals the chief specialists might devise.
Consider the plight of the poor little five-foot-six
middie who invariably found himself squared off
with the Man Mountain Dean of Notre Dame for
the wrestling periods which always followed.
[ 224 ]■
. Alarck
If the hapless seaman had reserved enough
strength to lift his weary bones from the deck-at the
end of calisthenics period he found himself hurried
out for roadwork trying to keep up with a double-
timing column led by a P-38 with jet propulsion.
Warmer weather brought games to the athletic
program, and football, softball, soccer and volley-
ball were entered into with such vigor that a swing
shift of pharmacists mates was required in sick bay.
With spring came early morning calisthenics. At
0540 the reveille bell jarred midshipmen out of
warm bunks.
Swimming came in for emphasis in the physical
training of Notre Dame men. Abandon ship drill,
fire fighting, swimming with rifles, disrobing in
water, and safety precautions were included in the
regular one-two-three-kick instruction for the side
stroke, back stroke and drawl. Sub squads were
formed for the non-swimmers.
The obstacle course provided an interesting
method of combining skill and strength. Con-
structed with ropes, walls, ditches, logs and stumps,
hills and inclines, twisting trails and straight-aways,
the obstacle course brought into play every part of
a midshipman’s physique in crossing it.
Competition among battalions and smaller units
developed an esprite de corps which introduced a keen
rivalry into the sports program. Each unit at-
tempted to outdo the next with every participation
from rifle drills to strength tests. The second set of
tests given at the end of the training program indi-
cated a distinct improvement in the strength and
stamina of the graduating midshipmen.
As the newly commissioned fifth midshipman
class of Notre Dame takes its place in the ranks of
fighting men on world-wide battle fronts, it can do
so with confidence in its ability to meet all emer-
gencies. To the officers and physical instructors of
Notre Dame go the thanks of 1200 naval officers
who have received the physical development neces-
sary “to meet the enemy and to destroy him
wherever he may be found.”

a midshipman’s life at. Notre Dame, was charac-

What is an azimuth angle? Who is responsible
for the deck log? What type of projectile has a yel-
low nose and a purple and green vertically striped
body? What would you do if your LST^had a
torpedo in its bow? Such questions plagued us
during our waking and sleeping hours.
To supplement our classroom periods, there were
drills. In ordnance we acquired first hand knowl-
edge of the intricacies of the 20mm, 5 inch - 38,
mines, and torpedoes. In six easy lessons our sea-
manship drills taught us how to splice a line, heave
a line, walk a boom, moor a ship, and send and
receive semaphore. “Shooting the sun” became
less of a mystery when we were introduced to the
sextant during a navigation drill. And a damage
control drill provided us with the proper technique
for handling a hose.
Countless hours were spent in plotting running
fixes and learning the 999,999 duties of a watch
officer. Many more hours were consumed working
ballistics problems only to find that the problem
which took us a half hour to work out is done in-
stantaneously by machines aboard ship. We will
also remember the tons of fuel oil we shifted to
balance our ship in damage control.
Many times we were fully convinced that the sole
purpose of the Academic Department was to con-
vert us to walking encyclopedias. Their success will
be measured by our record as Ensigns, USNR.

His dormitory was a ship—the U.S.S. Morrissey,
the U.S.S. Howard, the U.S.S. Badin or the U.S.S.

deck. The walls were bulkheads. The halls were
passageways. And the head—well, it was not
what he thought it was.

For the next four months his life was a maze of
“On the double”, “up the ladder”, “off the

Although he found himself constantly on the
“rock-pile”, seldom was the time he failed to lay
aside his fire control problem to join a good “bull
session.” With no OOD around to interrupt their
conversation, there was always' some fresh scuttle-
butt, or women, or politics, or women, or sports, or
women, or Flynn vs. Chaplin, or some other such
esoteric subject into which midshipmen might delve
with all the flower of wit and repartee.
Waiting seemed to constitute a big part of the

To midshipmen at Notre Dame, Saturday
mornings meant little other than inspections—
room and personnel. At 1630 on Friday afternoons
“field day” received the midshipmen’s utmost
attention in preparation for inspection the following
morning.
Every microscopic speck of dirt was swabbed
from the deck, the furniture was polished to a
glossy sheen, windows were cleaned to spotless
perfection and beds were made with 45-degree
“hospital corners”, carefully eliminating those
omnipresent “Irish pennants.”
On Saturday mornings there was little time in
which to check the room for lint on the deck or
dust above the door. In less time than it took a
navigation instructor to say “quickie” the MOD
would pipe at the top of his voice, “Inspecting
party is aboard. All hands stand by.”
The room captain took his place near the door
and listened for the approach of the inspection
party. Their voices could be heard the entire
length of the passageway and it seemed as. if the
officers had found demeritable flaws in every room.
At that point the nervous room captain scruti-
nized his room and, to his horror, a piece of string
or lint always lurked beneath the desks. The
greatest decision of the day faced him. Should he
risk a quick move to retrieve the elusive object and
stuff it into his laundry bag? If he did not, he re-
ceived a count for a dirty deck. If he did and were
caught before he returned to parade rest, he
collected five demerits. The devil and the deep
blue sea........
Personnel inspections consisted essentially of
standing at attention for what seemed to be hours
on end. The sound controlman who slipped “Time
on My Hands” on the turntable used for marches
during inspection won the lifelong friendship of
. every midshipman who knew what it meant to
stand at attention and wait for an inspection party.
When the inspection time arrived, the average
midshipman was terrified by the display of gold
braid on the sleeves of the inspection party. It was
a source of pleasure to him when Captain Barry
passed by with his general approval. But not
until the chain of officers had passed deep into the
next company did he permit his tense muscles to
relax or allow his breathing to become normal.

Campus Scenes

Among the memories of our four months spent at
Notre Dame will be the campus scenes we faced as
we marched to class, chow, the drill hall, or just
marched for the sake of marching.
We will remember especially well the abrupt
changes in weather peculiar only to the Notre
Dame campus. The accompanying effect was to
present the campus in a variety of moods ranging
from a half inch layer of ice on the trees and shrubs
to the green pattern of a late spring.
The early part of our stay was characterized by
weather which sometimes made the problem of
stable footing one that resulted- in a lack of ap-
preciation of the scene.. These pages are an
attempt to portray the campus picture.

-Watches'formed a prominent part of the passing
parade of midshipman life. 0200-0400 roving
patrol, 2400-0200 classroom security, and 0400-
0700 drill hall security watches produced heavy-
eyed middies doing their best to keep their eyes
open during that fifth period seamanship class.
The watch muster at 1930 resulted in a long line
of bright sh(5es topped by the uniform of the day
and clean shaven faces. “Ready to relieve, sir!”'
was followed by the relief of MOD’s, AMOD’s and
sundry other individuals. The Fire Bill was com-
mitted to memory and the midshipmen regulations
were consulted to determine what, when, where,
and how. Despite the numerous rules, most of us
managed to keep off the JOOD’s report sheet.

(Present c4rm&
Shots, which for the first few weeks in midship-
man school made life hardly ■ worth living on
Wednesdays and often on Thursdays, came all too
frequently.
Protection from tetanus, typhoid, yellow fever,
small pox, and all binnacle lists was guaranteed by
the weekly inoculations.
Shots provoked no end of topics for conversation.
One question which never seemed to be settled was
“Which is worst—the initial pain or the after
effects?” The adherents of the “initial pain”
theory recalled the mental anguish that preceded
the ordeal. The “after effects” faction recalled
agonizing push-ups on already aching arms. But
on one matter both factions agreed—shots were
just plain bad.

jniYsioi mw
Most envied of all middies at Notre Dame on
those unfortunate days were fleet men who had .
undergone the pains of inoculations previous to
their arrival at Notre Dame. The newcomers
would vow that the “salts” regarded vaccination
day with a sadistic pleasure.
Even the pharmacist mates seemed to enjoy the
occasion with their “See, it doesn’t hurt—just
don’t step on the bodies on your way out!”

From reveille to taps, life at the Notre Dame
Midshipmen’s School was a round of melody and
rhythm. From the time it jarred midshipmen out
of their bunks until it tucked them in at 2200, at
chow and other formations, the now familiar bugle
was on hand. The middies marched to class and
back with the drummer’s ragtime, jazztime, swing,
any old thing.
On the shoulders of twenty-odd midshipmen fell
, this responsibility. The group played for forma-
tions and each man took his turn on bugle watch
or drum watch.
The organization was headed, by Ens. Richard
Tainter, a bandmaster since World War I. For
the first two months, the corps was under the direc-
tion of Midshipman J. W. Farmer, a specialist.
After his withdrawal the baton passed to Midship-
man R. E. Boakes, general candidate, who added
flash and color to the corps with his baton-twirling
ability.

^tid^kipmen Qlee Club
Good-will envoys of the Notre Dame Midship-
men’s School were men in the Glee Club. The
number of members was smaller than that of choirs
of former classes. But over fifty percent of the
Glee Club had three years college experience and
what was lacking in numbers was compensated for
in quality.
Though their fellow trainees did not see them
perform until the Happy Hour, the Glee Club had
been active since the beginning of the course.
Every Thursday evening at 1730 they sang over
Radio Station WSBT, South Bend, from the Notre
Dame studio located in Washington Hall. On
several occasions they sang in churches in South
Bend, and many of them were members of church
choirs in town.
For the first eight weeks the Glee Club was di-
rected by Midshipman Olin Ostendorf, after which
time these duties fell to Midshipman J. Holliday
Veal for the second half of the training period.
Midshipman Veal was student director of the Duke
University Glee Club and Choir, and was active
in choral work and operettas throughout his col-
lege career.
The feature soloist of the Glee Club was Midship-
man Earl Dahlstrom, baritone. Accompanist
• duties were shared by Midshipmen Robert Rahn
and Donald Irving. Midshipman Bernard C.
Banks was announcer for the radio broadcasts.

A dance band sounds like something far removed
from the world of a midshipman, but snatches of
tunes emanating from Morrissey Chapel at 1730
several days each week set all the hep-cats in the
vicinity in that “makes-you-wanta’-dance” mood.
The band was handicapped by a late start in
organization and by lack of practice rooms. But
it coordinated very quickly and functioned like a
veteran organization.
Under the direction of Ensign H. N. Duda, who
also doubled on the tenor sax, the band was fea-
tured at several tea dances in the Servicemen’s
Center.
Station activities also found the band on hand to
keep the situation strictly on the “jive” side. The
band was one of the main attractions for the
“Happy Hour,” and played for other special pro-
grams at the Drill Hall.
The midshipmen making up the band had a col-
lection of interesting backgrounds behind their
playing. Fred Lines in the trumpet section was at
one time with Johnny Long. Ed Jordon, lead
tenor sax man, is the brother of Steve Jordon of
guitar-playing fame. Dick Phelan was a bugler in
the Seabees before coming to Notre Dame. Mis-
shipmen Woodworth and Stover played with Navy
bands at other bases in the South and West. The
band was as truly cosmopolitan as it was good.

A highlight of our last weeks at Notre Dame was
the Happy Hour. An established program at the
Midshipmen’s. School, it was the long-awaited
chance for the midshipmen to “ride” the officer
personnel.
The Happy Hour, under the guidance of Ensign
H. N. Duda, consisted of skits of each battalion
plus several songs by the Glee Club and the toe-
tapping music of the Midshipmen’s Dance Band.
One of the highlights of the evening was Midship-
man C. E. Pitte as Lew Lehr, the comedian, in
the Second Battalion’s “Ensigns are the Funniest
People”. The skit included a wardroom scene with
Midshipman E. H. Mahoney as Ensign J. D. Wells,
Midshipman G. Nye as Ensign T. A. Cooper, Mid-
shipman E. Polokoff as Ensign C. H. Flowers,
Midshipman N. I. Rafferty as Ensign A. J. Higgins,
and Midshipman J. J. O’Loughlin as Ensign W. J.
“Kid” Patton.
The First Battalion skit presented take-offs on the
classwork—with a 15-second quiz conducted by
Midshipman J. Athy, the manual of arms, and the
discipline of Lt. J. R. Grandfield as portrayed by
Midshipman J. B.. Applebome. And the Third
Battalion took care of their share of the program
with Midshipman F. M. Treacy, as a singing com-
mentator, introducing portrayals of Lt. A. G. Pence
(Midshipman W. M. M. Thompson), Ensign S. W.
Rider (Midshipman E. S. Small), and Ensign S. R.
Mosher (Midshipman C. P. Swan).

“Deadline” was a word that came to be as
dreaded as “Muster”, “P-Work”, and “Double.
Time”, to those midshipmen who made their way
to and from the Capstan office between classes, dur-
ing liberty and all other such hours.
More than one 4.0 was sacrificed by staff mem-
bers to produce this, the fifth Capstan. Grades,
study hours, and even liberty were at times slighted.
With all apologies to Joyce Kilmer, it is not only
. . God who can make a tree; the Capstan staff turned
out like an Arbor Day celebration for tree musters
at times. Photographers, proofreaders, ad men
and even the editor, himself, found themselves
“swamped” on occasions with an incongruous
muddle of cutlines, rules of the road, layouts, parts
of a Mark XIV firing lock, rush proofs, running
fixes, rewrites and corpen nines.
But it is with no regret that the staff writes “30”
on this Capstan, even though certain little sacrifices
were required in its production.- The most poig-
nant memories the members of the Capstan staff
will retain as they leave the campus of the Golden
Dome is the pleasant association with officers and
midshipmen afforded by producing this publication.

3n cAppreciation
As the Capstan goes to press we wish to take this opportunity to
thank the many who have helped in its compilation.
A large vote of thanks goes to Lt. (jg) Vincent C. Conlan and
Ens. Charles L. Latimer, Jr., for the full cooperation and aid they
gave to this publication. Their work as editorial advisers was
invaluable.
Although Lt. Kenneth G. Pearce left early in our training period,
we tender thanks to him for setting up the business staff as an
efficient organization before he reported for sea duty.
Mr. Ray Moran, our publisher, contributed immeasurably with
his advice and cooperation during the many days spent on the
layout of this book.
Lt. (jg) Paul T. Sprinz, public relations officer, is due thanks for
the information and pictures he contributed. And we really appre-
ciated the typing done by the Waves in the Administration Office.
To Esquire go orchids for the use of their cartoons and we also
thank C. G. Conn, Ltd. for the art used on the inside cover and
page 214.
Last, but not least, we sincerely thank the officers and midship-
men for their cooperation when we needed it.

"Those engines sure hove the power!’’
THE brother of a waist gunner on
x a Boeing Flying Fortress wrote
Studebaker quoting him as saying:
“Those Wright Cyclone engines
that Studebaker builds are really de-
pendable and sure have the power.” .
Comments like that are fully ap-
preciated, of course. But Studebaker
men and women know that what
count most are the accomplishments
of the stout-hearted air crews and
rugged ground crew of our coun-
try’s warplanes and the achievements
of our fighting forces everywhere.
In fact, whatever amount of satis-
eftuMafar
BUILDS WBIGILT CICLONE ENGINES

faction the Studebaker organization
may derive from the extent and con-
sequence of its war work is always
tempered by the realization that
Studebaker is only one unit in a vast
American fighting and producing
team where everyone’s effort is im-
portant.
Studebaker takes pride in its as-
signments on that team. Huge quan-
tities of Wright Cyclone engines for
' the Boeing Flying Fortress—big mul-
tiple-drive military trucks—and
other units of vital war materiel con-
tinue to stream forth from the five
great Studebaker factories.

Hurtling at top speed over rough terrain, fighting

Dangerously close to the battle lines, gallant crews
of skilled technicians follow with their mobile ma-

any ailing tank and speed it back into action. And
there are not many jobs they can’t do in the field,
for their equipment has been carefully selected to
provide the utmost versatility and precision.
An essential tool in the mobile shop is the lathe.

is to supply South Bend Precision Lathes for these
indispensable units in America’s motorized army.

a child of Minneapolis Mol me
Current national publicity has obscured the fact that the first
war machine named “JEEP” was born at Minneapolis-
Moline and christened at Camp Ripley, Minnesota (with
apologies to Ripley—“Believe it or not”).
||S8gg Back in 1938 Minneapolis-Moline engineers were already
The Original Jeep on maneuvers In 1940
Six-wheel Jeep pulling anti-aircraft gun
Sergeant O'Brien at the wheel of new
four-wheel Jeep
’ experimenting with the conversion of a farm tractor to an
artillery prime mover; and in 1940, collaborating with Ad-
jutant General E. A. Walsh, Commander of the Minn. Nation-
al Guard, models were tested in maneuvers at Camp Ripley.
' This new MM army vehicle was not a crawler tractor,
truck nor tank, and yet it could do almost anything and it
knew all the answers. Because of this, it brought to mind the
Popeye cartoon figure called “Jeep” which was neither fowl
nor beast, but knew all the answers and could do most any-
thing. The National Guardsmen therefore named the MM
vehicle the “Jeep”. The “Jeep” name therefore is not a con-
traction of the term General Purpose (GP), and if it really had .
been, no doubt “Jeep” would have been spelled “Geep”. ‘
Since the original MM Jeep, Minneapolis-Moline has
designed several additional models of Military tractors in co-
operation with Army and Navy officials. Several models of
MM Jeeps are now being produced in quantity for the'Armed
Forces of the United Nations, and in use throughout the world.
