' Sn the Suture days which we seek to make secure, we look
forward to a world founded upon four essential freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech and expression—
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his.
own way—	.
The third is freedom from want—
The fourth is freedom from fear—
We are fighting today for security, for progress, and peace, not
only for ourselves but for all men, not only for one generation, but
for all generations. We are fighting to cleanse the world of ancient
evils, ancient ills.
T)ke (better World for which you.fight—and for, which some
of you give your lives—will not come merely because we shall have
won the war. It wilLnot come merely because we wish very hard
that it would come. It will be made possible only by bold vision,
intelligent planning and hard work. It can not be brought about
over night; but only by years of effort and perseverance and un-
faltering faith. \


Colorful, versatile and likeable, Captain J. Richard Barry, for thirty-nine years an officer in the United
States Navy, has’shipped on almost every type of vessel in the fleet, well earning the respect of all under
his command.
As commanding officer of the midshipmen’s school, Captain Barry is an inspiration to every trainee,
and his career is a mbdel for today’s new officers.
Entering the Naval Academy in 1905, Captain Barry graduated four years later and was assigned to
his first duty aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. Later he was transferred to the destroyer Drayton and then
back Jo the battlewagon service aboard the dreadnaught Michigan.
1 During'the first world war, Captain Barry assumed command of the Pampanga, a Spanish gunboat.
'He began extensive duty in China and other far eastern waters. He then was made Captain of the Yard
and Aide to the Commandant at the Naval Station at Cavite, P.I.
He later served on the North Dakota, and from there he went to the Navy Department in Washington.
After a tour of duty there, Captain Barry served on the DD Reno.	; ,
From the Reno he returned to Annapolis, this time as an instructor in Seamanship and Flight tactics.
’Immediately following his duty there, he served on the staff of the Commandant of the Train Squadron
of the Atlantic Fleet.
Returning to shore duty in_Washington, Captain Barry graduated from the Naval War College’ and
became executive officer of the Trenton, CL. In 1938 he was made Commanding Officer of the Trenton,
after an intervening period of duty ashore as executive officer of the Naval Training Station, Newport, R. I. '
Under his command, the Trenton became the flagship of the European Squadron. He went'from the
Trenton to Colombia, South America, where he served for two years as-chief of the U. S. Naval Mission.
to that country.	' •	"	-
Captain Barry reported to Notre Dame as Commanding Officer following his South American duty.
; Upon receiving your commissions, and weighing anchor
to depart from this school, terminating the first phase of
your naval career, I should like to extend to you all my
best wishes, as well as those of the officers of this com-
mand who have been responsible for your training.
It has been a pleasure to guide you through this first
phase and now, on behalf of the Navy, I welcome you,
who I know have the courage and determination to join
this fight side- by side with your brother officers in our
march to total victory.
To each of you I say, good luck, good hunting, and a
happy landing.
Jr Richard Barry
Captain, U. S. Navy
Entrusted with the responsibility of putting into action the orders of the station, Commander T. C.
_ Scaffe has done just that since last March when he became Executive Officer of the Midshipmen’s school.
As one biographical sketch in the past stated, “Com. Scaffe is discipline tempered with a sense of justice
and understanding in the art of commanding men.” No better statement could be made. '	'
As he laid down the law to personnel, his fairness, competence and character was borne out, and he
gained the admiration and respect of the regiment.	’
Commander Scaffe was graduated from Annapolis in 1919, a World War I midshipman class. His
first duty upon graduation was the transporting of troops back from the European war theatre. But he
. had been an athlete in his day, and so back he went to Annapolis in 1920 as assistant football coach.
From the time of his Academy graduation until 1925, he served on the battleship New Hampshire, the
destroyer Flusser, on which he was executive officer: and the cruiser Cleveland, where he was chief engineer.
In 1925 he served his first duty as a training school administrator when he and another officer established
the first NROTC unit at St. John’s College. This unit was an experimental unit and was used as a test of
such training as to possibilities and value.	,	.
Retiring from the Navy in 1927, Commander Scaffe served as athletic director of Wofford College until
1933. At that time he left Wofford to accept a position with the_Gulf Corporation in Atlanta, Ga.
With the approach of the current war, he was. recalled to duty in 1940 with the rank of lieutenant.
From that time until he came here, he taught engineering at the USNR school (at Annapolis and again
acted as-assistant,football coach for four seasons.
’ Commander Scaffe was promoted to his present rank during the July-October term.
§ ;	Congratulations upon the completion of your midship-
■	man training. By success here, you have indicated capa-
a; .	bilities of performing the more exacting duties of a naval
| i . officer aboard ship.
H.	Here, you are students—aboard ship you will be leaders.
I	' Only by demonstrating complete knowledge of your duties,
H \	and the duties of the men under your command, will you
8 ’ - gain their confidence and respect. The foundation of your
'	■ knowledge has been laid here, how well you build on that
,	' foundation depends on you alone. '
f , 'Make the most of such training opportunities as it may
f---	l)e your good fortune to experience. Do not overlook your
~	. most valuable source of help—older and more experienced
\ officers. Aboard your first ship, take full advantage of
" . , your acquaintance with these men—learn their store of
J-	knowledge, follow their advice—observe and make your own
I ’	those intangible qualities which betoken leadership.
'■	My parting word is one of confidence and one^of hope;
"	confidence that you will do your work well while you are
t:	in the Navy, and hope that you will enjoy satisfaction and
'■	' safety in the performance of your duties..
. T. C. Scaffe r
Commander, U. S. Navy (Ret.)
c4 Parting Zfkoagkt
from
Jrank Knox
Secretary. o( tke J^avy} 1937-1944
You are going out to become leaders of men. The
time will come soon when other men’s lives, and the
success of their assigned tasks, will be in your hands.
. . . No officer can put too much thought into the
qualities that go into good leaders of men. I suggest
here that you watch the officers under whom you
serve, noting their successes and analyzing, to your-
self, those things about them you consider inade-
quacies, based on common sense and the technical
knowledge you have gained ...
* * *
Eventually it will fall to you to assist in deciding
- upon the strategy and tactics to be used. Then you
will be called upon to exercise the results of continuous
'study. You will then find that careful preparation
is the best safeguard against failure.
• . * * * ■
One of the greatest pitfalls in which human ability
can be trapped is self-satisfied complacency. Ships
have been sunk, men have been lost because of self-
complacency on their part or the part of those above
them. One capable battleship skipper remarked re-
cently that he would feel whipped before going into
battle if he. knew his-menunderestimated the task
ahead of them. It is only common sense to realize,
too, that over-confidence and the underrating of our
enemies are other short-cuts to failure and. defeat.’
You can be sure that our enemies are not under-
rating our striking ability. And we in turn must
not underrate theirs.
■ * * *
• A retired admiral, who long was known in the Navy .
as a hard driver but a model officer, had this to say to .
.a young lieutenant who was complaining that tra-
ditional customs on shipboard were being neglected:
“Young man,” the old Admiral barked, “don’t get
wrapped up in spit and polish and forget the job you
are being sent out to do—to fight and defeat your
enemies. Spit and polish has its place, but keep it
there.”	-
* * * .•
As you go out to take.your places on the battleships,
. the cruisers and carriers, the destroyers and sub-
marines of America’s fleet, I hope -you do not forget
that we are not alone in this war. The decent ele-
ments, the decent nations of the world are fighting at
our side, and’ they are giving a good account * of
themselves. You are going to come into contact with
members of other United Nations forces on every sea.
When you do meet them, salute them, for the bravery, •
the determination, and the aggressiveness they have
. shown .against our common enemies under almost
. constant fire for four years.

His days of hectic activity, however, arc
over and at last he is back • • •
ship’s service officer.

Lt. R. C. Tefft, ah assistant superintendent
of schools before the war, was one of the
many who donned Navy 16 oz. serge after
Pearl Harbor.	-
He received his training at Harvard and
Columbia and was ordered to Notre Dame.
Here his duties included an instructorship in
Navigation. He now acts as Administrative
Aide. Buy another War Bond today.


'. World War I was Com. G. S. Vogan’s first
introduction to military medicine. He re-
cieved a commission in the Army Medical
Corps after graduation from the University
of Pittsburgh, receiving training at the Army
Medical School, Washington, D. C._
In 1935 he entered the Navy and was called
to active duty in December, 1941, serving at
the Naval Hospital, Philadelphia. His pres-
ent duty at Notre Dame began in October,
1942. Midshipmen with not less than 102°
fever are excused from swimming. .
„ Lt. (jg) F. C. Roberts, Fourth'Battalion
Commander, came here from indoctrination
at fort Schuyler. Prior to going there he had
begn an instructor at Camp Perry, where he
finished boot training.
After receiving an AB degree at Wofford
College, an LLB at the University of South
Carolina, and an LLM at Columbia Uni-
versity, Mr. Roberts became Professor of Law
at the University of South Carolina. He also
was an attorney in Columbia, S. C.
. . Lt. (jg) Anne Warden came to Notre Dame
in April, 1943, from her teaching profession in
Tennessee. But on her arrival here there was
no apple for. the teacher. Instead'her duties
included acting as Women’s Reserve Repre-
sentative, Wave Division Officer, and Com-
munication’s Officer. •
With this handful of assignments she has
coped, fulfilling all the requirements, and
still keeping her powder dry.
Lt. Com. H. W. Rinesmith holds a D.D.S.
from Washington University of St. Louis and
was an assistant professor in dental surgery at
his Alma Mater before being commissioned
in 1938. Before his attachment to Notre ,
Dame, Com. Rinesmith was with the Barnes
Hospital, Medical Unit in St. Louis.
At Notre Dame he heads the Dental De-
partment and extractions have become pain-
less, but only in the financial sense.

For Lt. J. W. Covington it was but a short .
step from bank cashier to disbursing officer.
After graduating from Duke University he
worked in the Farmers Bank and Trust Co.
- in Rockingham, N. C. In April, 1942, he
entered the Navy and served as assistant
supply officer at the U. S. Navy Yard in
Charleston, S. C. In June he went to the
Navy Supply Corps School at Harvard for
. eight months training.
. In April, 1943, from the Seabee base at
Davisvifie, R. I., he was ordered to Notre
Dame as disbursing officer and is now serv-
ing as supply officer of the school. But life
has always been give and take.	.
Not long ago the Disbursing Office’s Lt.-(jg)
was known as Eloise Bealle, \V-V(S) SC, but.
then wedding bells rang. It is customary for
the bride involved in such incidents to change
her name, but in this case the change was
slight. She is now Lt. (jg) Eloise Bealle Bell.
Before entering the Navy Lt. Bell was an
accountant with the Ordnance Department,
U. S. Army. Now she handles the fire and
shell of midshipman pay accounts.

; Notre Dame, Ind., Oct. 27.—Navy
officials at the USNR Midshipmen’s
School were startled today by the
zsudden disappearance of the USS
Morrissey from her anchorage near
the campus greens. A watch officer
reported that the Morrissey had sailed
west about 0200 under full steam. He
had been patrolling the“harbor” when
he noticed a lurching movement from
the old ship as she belched forth a
cloud of smoke and steamed away past

of the

pJ 'commissioned ensigns who had spent

Notre Dame Midshipmen

Washington,' D. C., Oct. 30.—
:	Navy Department official* revealed
ii . today the approval of plan* for the
i immediate conversion of Badin Hall
I at the USNR Midshipmen’s School at
j . Notre Dame, Ind.,. into a training
i . ground for invasion tactic*.
i; ' \ The hall ha* been tclected for it*

ders have long afforded cliff-scaling
;	practice for midshipmen at Notre
~ Dame, but it was not until	recently
t	that the Navy Department	realized
3	its titanic value..
“Battle conditions are readily simu-
‘	' fated in Badin whenever more than

Michigan City, Ind., Sept. 13.—
Midshipmen returning from a one day
crash boat cruise on Lake Michigan
this afternoon, excited the town with
a tall tale of having spotted a white
whale in the vicinity of St. Joseph's
harbor.
* Seven middies declared excitingly
that they had spotted the whale while
serving as lookouts on the Hying bridge
and one went so far as to say that the
white whale was the once famous
Moby Dick.	*
“I saw several harpoons protruding
from his white back while we were
several miles away from him. I at first
thought it was one of those obstruc-
tions like the Germans had constructed
on the Normandy beach, but as we
came closer, I saw the high spout of
water. He submerged while we were
still some distance away," Midship-
man John Cawley, Chisholm, Minn.,
stated.
Tamsky’s Nose
Strictly Made
for Business
{Reprintedfrom S. F. Chronicle)
' San Francisco, Cal., June 17.—
Joseph Tamsky's nose for business led
to his enlistment in the Navy, and this
probably marks the first time tn history
that a man's nose brought him into
the nautical service.
As Joe tells the story, “I was stand-
ing in the Army recruiting line one
day talking to a friend who was join-
ing the dogfaces. I had no Idea of
getting into any service just yet, but
there was a Navy recruiting line paral-
lel to the Army line and I kept walking
up with my buddy. Well just the time
I reached the chief who was signing
up the Navy volunteers, some one
pushed me. My nose turned right
toward that chief and before I knew
what.was happening, he damped my
nose in a door and said 'sign here.'
“Several days later I came to. I
had ‘volunteered* for the Navy."
Another sport has been added to the
athletic schedule at the University of
Notre Dame. ' Cross country racing
has suddenly achieved a renewed pop-
ularity. Enthusiasm has been ex-
pressed by midshipmen stationed on
the campus, but'so far Navy officials
have seen fit to restrict participation in
the sport to the members of the Fourth
Battalion, quartered in Badin Hall.
The men have little time for extra-
curricular activities, but the tireless
efforts of company officers have re-
sulted in permission to engage in cross
country racing at least once a day.
Special rules have been instituted for
increased enjoyment.. Hours for the
sport are unannounced and are usu-
ally surprises for whiling away super-
fluous study periods.
These are the rules now in effect.
First, the battalion forms and marches
two miles to a drill to get in shape -or
possibly to see a training film. Then
the battalion is marched back past
Badin, past Howard, and on to Morris-
sey where it halts. Instead of shouting
“on your mark, set, go" the substitu-
tion of a newer phrase has added
novelty to the sport. At the word
“dismissed" all fourth battalion men
are given the privilege of dashing
madly for fifteen minutes over all ob-
stacles until they reach their goal
in Badin.
Sicrttary Forrutal.
First Batt Middies
Announce New
Secret Weapon
Midshipmen in the first battalion
have announced the invention of a
new secret weapon as yet released only
to fellow midshipmen. It is known as
the automatic Jumping Jack and Cal-
isthcnic Exerciser.
Controlled mechanically by a slen-
der rod, it can be operated by a mid-
shipman reclining under a bush or
hedge more than six yards away. The
machine hops and waves dummy arms
realistically and is guaranteed against
detection oy theJOOD at a distance
of more than 12 feet.

Beloved Canine "Salty”
Gone Way of all Flesh
Ordnance Dept.
Has Designed
New Type Gun
South Bend, Ind.—Recent rumors
coming from the USNR Midshipmen's
School here indicate that the Ord-
nance Department has made a progres-
sive step toward formulation of plans
designed to give the U.S. Navy a newer,
harder-hitting dual purpose gun.
The new gun will have a barre] that
is neither monoblock, radially ex-
panded nor built up, and according to
Washington bizwigs, who allegedly
examined the plans today, a new era
in gunnery has begun.
Mail Orderlies
Must Handle
Mail Tactfully
Mail orderlie* have been instructed
to deal tactfully with the problem of
midshipman mail. Survey* show that
mail has a pronounced effect on mo-
rale and that the lack of correspond-
,ence has even resulted in cases of
_ mental collapse.
- One .midshipman is reported re-
cuperating in the infirmary after suffer-
ing an emotional shock induced by
mail call. For three week* he had re-
ceivcd no letter*. Then one morning
' the section snail orderly called his
. name five time*. His elation proved
too much ofa strain, and he collapsed.
Later examination of the letter*, how-
ever, gave evidence that the shock may
have been induced by disappointment,
for the fatal letters contained a brief
note front the midshipman's home
(without enclosed funds), ads from two
tailoring establishments, a local church
notice, and a blank for a magazine
' : ’ nibscription.	,
Infirmary reports show that the
, midshipman is well except for his con-
.. *tant writing of letters which he ad-
'■, dresses to himself. . x
ment, whose name has been withheld
upon request, said the idea for the new
type barrel is an outgrowth of an idea
he had while on duty in Lyons Hall
asJOOD.
“It occurred to me that a revolu-
tionary move in gunnery could be
made if by some means a barrel could
be cast that would afford super resist-
ance to shock like the passageways in
Lyons do to midshipmen traffic when
formation bells ring. The idea was de-
veloped from that," the inventor said.
With the announcement of more
rigorous calisthenics, production has
jumped more than 200 per cent and
the inventors have more orders than
they can handle. Their chief difficulty
is the scarcity of bushes in the vicinity
of Badin Hall to screen customers
when they receive their dummies.
This difficulty has been temporarily
surmounted by a new instruction man-
ual titled Goldbricking in Three Easy
Lessons.
Sec. Forrestal ■
Reveals Story j
of Navy Heroes j
Washington, D. C., (ZP) Oct. 26.-	।
A new campaign ribbon hat(been z I
authorized by the Navy Department , ■
and all persons having participated io - ;
the Battle of Notre Dame on or prior i
to October 26, 1944, will be eligible
to wear the ribbon of honor. • j
In a speech today before a gathering
of veteran Marine Leathernecks on
Saipan, Secretary ofthe Navy Forrestal / 1
said “Last week we authorized the
wearing of a new campaign ribbon for
the courageous spirit of tho Navy men
who have oecn on duty at Notre Dame
since the war began. Few men in the
Navy's history have fought more gal-
lantly than those."
Secretary Forrestal in describingthe
coloring of the new ribbon said, “This	-
Notre Dame defense bar will be col-
ored beautifully. It has a deep orange
background with light yellow stripes
running horizontally, and a green foot- ;
ball in the center. I know the mid-
shipmen and other personnel attached -.
to the Indiana stronghold will be
overjoyed with this announcement.” •
“It is the opinion of the Navy De-
partment that any midshipman who
has the stamina to withstand the kill-
ing affect of sixteen weeks training at
Notre Dame should receive some rib-
bon for meritorious service. Some
officials have even suggested that the
Purple Heart be authorized for per- i
sonnel injured through athletics or
morning calisthenics. This was voted
down, however, because the possibility
of wholesale distribution of Purple-
Hearts might exhaust the supply," r
Mr. Forrestal said.
Another Navy Department offia’al
commenting upon the new ribbon ।
stated that “a special provision is go-
ing to be entered into the bill whereby
all instructors at Notre Dame will re-
ceive a gold star for each class that .
graduates. This clause will be retro-
active, thus giving some of the in-
structors currently assigned to duty
there enough stars not only to coyer
the ribbon but additional ones which
may be worn on either side of the
hat device."	'
Should officers be retained on the
station for the duration, small, com-
pressed Japanese heads will be awarded
them by the President of the United
States as a token of their bravery and
extreme devotion to duty without re-
gard to their personal safety. .. .,
This is the story of a dog. •
* More than 1200 bluejackets checked
in at the USNR Midshipmen's School
at Notre Dame on 6 July 1944 and
began training—a full 16 weeks of
training that is tough from the begin-
ning and doesn't leave much to live
for when each night rolls around.
There were few bright spots in the
week. Not many men smiled more
than a couple of times from Saturday
until the next Saturday. It was a kind
of morbid existence that you dream
about on nights when you have indi-
gestion. Men double timed in a daze
more than they dreamed themselves
capable.
But there was just one little life that
added something to the day.. That
little life gave the day a tiny tinge of
home and peace and serenity. That
little life was America in an insignifi-
cant kind of way because all Ameri-
cans are lovers of creatures like it.-
Yes, it was nothing more or less than
a pup of a pooch that apparently never
had had a home. He had wagged his
stub of a tail around the campus for
many months before the July middies
came to the campus. He had long
been a part of the midshipman day,
sometimes the only reminder of pre-
war happiness and privileges now
shattered.
But “Salty," as he was called by all,
didn't fit in with the midshipman
training program. He did sometimes
trot along in front of formations and
even came out for calisthenics some
mornings. But he liked the boys and
they liked him. That's what made
it so bad.
Salty was not part of the program.
He was just a pain in the neck to some
weird officers.
. Thus his life was snapped a bit short
with six bullets through his tiny head.
Boston to Frisco
“I have been on liberty in just about
every town from Frisco to Boston, but
never have I seen so many women who
were ready to talk to a sailor as there
are right here in South Bend," Mid-
shipman Joe Scroggins said upon be-
ing interviewed by the Puddleburg
Daily Splash today.
“Yeah, I have served a hitch in the
Navy and have been all over the east
and west coast. But in spite of the
notorious name that sailors have for
finding women, I never had much ludc
until my‘ good fortune guided me to
Notre Dame and midshipman training.
Why, there are more girls around here
than you can shake a stick at,"
Scroggins said.
“Now a fellow like me who had his
face smashed in by a mule's kick when
he"was a baby has little chance among
the fairer sex in most towns. -They
usually just give me one look and say
they didn't know Frankenstein had a
son. But around here the situation is
different. I think I’m a kind of
favorite with 'em." ,
Midshipmen today mourned
the advent of autumn and the
coming of the harvest. They
gathered in knots on the drill
held and gazed, sorrowfully at
the adjacent fields where stand-
ing com once waved. No more
would tall stalks screen them
from the rigors of calisthenics
and athletics. After a moment's
silence they turned away and
began a game of touch football
under the watchful eye of know-
ing instructors.
V-12'er Slips
in Midshipmen's
School Ranks
Officials have Imposed a strict cen-
sorship upon the station pending the
investigation of the charges that a
prospective V-12 was caught in the
melee of incoming midshipmen last
July and had completed the training
course without realizing his mistake.
They stated that one man coming from
the fleet to Notre Dame unwittingly
stepped into the wrong line and was
whisked through one day of indoctri-
nation. But the error was caught
when a WAVE discovered that his
serial number did not end in 2 or 3.
Undisclosed sources indicated today
that the administration fears a large
scale attempt on the part of V-12’s to
insinuate themselves into the ranks of
midshipmen, and are making every
attempt to' disprove the report.

I, J. Archibald Gish, Jr., was poured into the
Regimental office at the University of Notre Dame
...	.	Midshipmen’s School on
™ v B •	6 July 1944, two and one-
tenth minutes before my
leave papers said “you
1 damned well better be
| checked in by this time or
go on report for being
A.O. Loose.” At least that was the gist of thesentence.
“Whatcha mean by cornin’ in ere grunk? Ats

O.O.D. said when I walked (very deliberately)
into the office.
“I’m not drunk, sir. Why can’t you talk better
than that? I believe you are doused to the eye
balls,” I said boldly.
J- A week later I was returned to midshipmen’s
school after a not so pleasant sojourn in the brig.
Time moved on with the speed of a snail.
' All in all I spent hundreds and thousands of days
at Notre Dame between July 6 and October 26,
every day a duplicate of the one before it. But
just for the heck' of it, I’ll run through a day’s
excitement and thrills.

I, J. Archibald Gish, Jr., was poured into the
Regimental office at the University of Notre Dame
।	.	u	.	Midshipmen’s	School on
k	Kh n h .	6 July 1944, two and one-
\	tenth minutes	before my
|	leave papers	said “you
1	damned well	better be
checked in by this time or
go on report for being
A.O. Loose.” At least that was the gist of the sentence.
“Whatcha mean by cornin’ in ere grunk? Ats
no way to git goin’ in midshipmanhs schoosl,” the
O.O.D. said when I walked (very deliberately)
into the office.
“I’m not drunk, sir. Why can’t you talk better
than that? I believe you are doused to the eye
balls,” I said boldly.
A week later I was returned to midshipmen’s
school after a not so pleasant sojourn in the brig.
Time moved on with the speed of a snail.
All in all I spent hundreds and thousands of days
at-Notre Dame between July 6 and October 26,
every day a duplicate of the one before it. But
just for the heck' of it, I’ll run through a day’s
excitement and thrills.
Let’s call that day Juvember 32, because it was
no different from any of the others.

and slammed against/the bulkhead. All teeth
amazingly remained secure.
0158—“Ready to relieve you, son,” I half-con-
sciously murmured, slumped into shadows of Lyons

the (Beginning ,.
That first week was hell, wasn’t it?
We will long remember, and for that matter
never forget, those days in the beginning when
- every hour was packed full of rush and run, hurry
and scurry, when you forgot the very meaning of •
the word “leisure.” There was no such thing left
in the midshipman’s world.
They started straggling in about 1 July, and from
then on until 7 July, gobs checked in at head-
quarters. They came from all over, from Wash-
ington’s woodland to Florida’s Everglades, from the
tip of Maine to the Texas horn, from California’s
sunshine to New .Orleans’ seaswept shores.
It was a bunch of youngsters, too. It marked
the first time that a class had been made up almost
solely of V-12 students, with ages less by two years
than previous Notre Dame trainees.
There was pleasure in shedding that white bell-
bottom regalia for the chino greys. It made every
nerve tingle a bit with that old feeling of nearness
to something that had been in the far distant. It
made no difference in the beginning that we were
just midshipmen without portfolio, without anchors
and without having said those words which made
us “officers , in a qualified sense.” And from the
way we reacted to every ensign’s whim, we soon
realized that we were “qualified” in a very limited
sense. It did not take long to break the spirit of
the most vehement egotist. He soon realized his
minuteness, his insignificance; and a robot’s ex-
- . istence was told, in the life he led until 26 October.
Classes began with a bang. They ended the
same way. College students who had had a rela-
tively simple task of making scholastic hurdles
found themselves faced with something abstract in
everything. There was no resemblance to the past.
A new era had dawned-—an era that initiated aca-
demic hysteria for all concerned, and it was ap-
parent that tedious hours of painstaking study were
in store for all.
Indoctrination was no fun. Everything was
thrown in our face. Baffled, confused and demoral-
ized, some stepped down at the end of that, first
- three weeks and marched off to the Lakes. But
the vast majority had pulled through. Now things
will let up a little, we optimistically dreamed, Be-
cause the weeding out process has passed. How
wrong we were!
That first week after indoctrination was twice as .
tough as anything prior to it. Seamanship and the
communications that went with it are still just
swirls of clouds in a memory of turning right, turn-
ing left,, but mostly just going around in circles.
Navigation, likewise, found many at wits’ end.
Buoys, red lights, green lights—but again mostly
red lights because that was the stop signal. It
stopped some, too.
, Ordnance and Damage Control waited a bit to
add -their confusion. That came the second
semester.
Marching men. Boot camp had been the
“privilege” of some middies who came in from the^
fleet. But boot camp was never the equal of mid-
shipmen’s school. It was soft in comparison.
Every chow formation-was a mad 100-yard dash
at a double-double time pace.' The war had
really speeded, up.
I ■'

I 246 ] . '.
And then there was executive. Forward, double .
to the rear, by the left flank and halt. Hut-tut-
three-four and on and on it went. It is good to
look back at those things instead of toward them.
[Athletics in general was not so bad. The biggest
kick came from the persistent playing of the game
we liked least. If you liked football, you played
volleyball; if you liked volleyball, you played soft-
ball, and so on.
The days passed. The weeks started flashing by.
Midterm exams became the chief subject of con-
versation. And then with lightning-like rapidity
those oversized P-works went by. And another
group of middies turned in books, packed their gear
and high-tailed it to the Lakes. Our ranks were
dwindling. Didn’t the Navy need any more offi-
cers? It seemed that way.’
But just before those midterms and immediately
following them, Ordnance decided to shoot the
' works. Fire control, that something or other that
the instructors talked about for a couple of weeks
•that had to do with trajectory, rejectory, projectory
or something came floating over the-class rooms.
What were they talking about? .The “trees” grew
larger. It was a pleasure to read' Einstein fqr re-
_ laxation to find something' that was not so dense
and obscure.	.	'
Damage Control had its day. Stability became
the pass word. What causes a ship to do this and
what causes it to do that, and would you have to
throw the Captain overboard in jettisoning due to •
. the free surface effect? Before long we came to the
conclusion that the proper people to throw over-
board were the DC instructors. Our dynamical
an
STS
m a
stability was considerably decreased.
Some people had liberty, or rather all had
liberty and some took advantage of it. - Liberty in
South Bend was a bit of. all right if you were free
and twenty-one. It was not anything extraordi- ✓
.nary for the .younger set.
But we will always be indebted to the Service
Men’s Center. Without that organization, liberty -
would have been a bore in many cases. Their free
eats, cigarettes and dancing facilities were enjoyed
by every midshipman at one time or another.
The midshipmen dances also added something
to the recreation. It brought South Bend’s attrac-
tions, at least some of them, to Notre Dame instead
of taking Notre Dame’s attractions, if you can call
them that, to South Bend.
Well, you could rave on forever about any and
everything including those final exams that KO’ed ’
some middies. You could tell about the Notre
Dame and Tulane football game and a score of
other things. Mostly it would be just so many
things that we found inconvenient to our accus-
tomed way of life. Just let it be said that we
survived the ordeal. All in all, it was not fun and
there is little need for hypocrisy. But, perhaps, it
was not supposed to be fun. "Perhaps there is a
war going on and the life we lived was Utopia in
comparison to that of former midshipmen now
scattered over the earth’s face.
Perhaps we sliduld feel a bit ashamed, about as
low as a snake’s belt buckle, at having griped so
much and so consistently about everything^ But
we don’t. We are next to be scattered. Let’s
.fight a bit.

Intermingled with class routine, four midship-
men dances were arranged during the term and
were the chief entertainment features offered on
the base.	_ ■
Bringing to Notre Dame’s campus the damsels
of South Bend gave the middies an opportunity to
relax and forget and at the same time brought them
closer acquaintance with the officers of the station.
Under the guidance of Lt. P. T. Sprinz. a mid-
shipman dance committee made the arrangements
necessary to the sponsorship of the entertainment
and to them goes credit for the smoothness which
prevailed at every dance.
Decorating the Drill Hall with every flag in the
communications vocabulary was their task prior to .
every dance. They did a good job and gave the
hall a Navy atmosphere. The'colorful flags blended
in with the
maidens and
evening gowns of the South Bend
added beauty to every occasion.

When marching melody and rhythm were
needed, the band came to the rescue. A cosmo-
politan outfit reported for first rehearsals. Dozens
of representatives from college bands were in
the group.	-
Molding that’heterogenous group into a coordi-
nated outfit was the lot of Ensign Richard Tainter,
an old timer in the Navy who seryed as a band-
master in World War I. Mr. Tainter did a fine
job with the band and before the first two weeks
had rolled by, a presentable organization began
its thrice daily—meal time—appearance.
Indeed, it might be said that Mr. Tainter’s per- -
sonality kept the bandsters alive during the term.
Upon every occasion when another piece of music
was introduced to the boys, Mr.‘ Tainter told a
story about it.
' Jack Shad was chosen leader of the band shortly
after it began and waved the baton ably despite
his extra-curriculas including business manage-

been the same without the glee club, and those
services proved to be the chief occasion when the
songsters could put forth with their songs. How-

Under the direction of' amiable Ensign H. N.
Duda the Regimental dance band entertained the
middies on numerous occasions during the period
from July 6 to October 26. Its “music sweet with
a dash of heat” will be long remembered. The
dance band’s music is one of the things that broke
up the routine of Notre Dame sameness.
Calling for volunteers among the middies after
the term was well on its.way, Mr. Duda was greeted
with 15 men who were willing to venture into
extra curricular activities despite the burden of
academic “musts.”
The material was on hand from the beginning
because the middies came from all over and many
had played with college and semi-professional
bands previously. ,	...
Among the standouts in the outfit was I. Dworkin,
ace trumpeter, and D. C. Cantwell with his clarinet.
Other members of the band were M. F. Browne,
R. A. Beuter, J. Royal and R. E. Billmeyer, tenor
.saxes; K. H. Killinger and R. M. Foote, trom-
bones; B. R. McEwen, R. L. MacCormick and
J. R. Durfey,.trumpets; E. M. Casey, piano; G. W. ‘
Walton, base fiddle; J. F. Ringelstein, drum; and .
J. O. Crosby, guitar.

Despite an acute shortage of extra time, some
thirty-odd middies answered the first call for Capstan
volunteers, but as the term grew older the staff grew
smaller. We ended up with a mere handful who
still were willing to sacrifice liberty and jeopardize
academic standing to preserve for posterity the
things that happened to you at Notre Dame.
- But that sounds noble and is not what we wish
to-convey. The men who are responsible for this
, edition worked purely for the love of journalism,
art and photography. There was no ulterior mo-
tive, no selfishness, no desire to miss anything that
every other midshipman endured.
Time was precious and weekends just meant
many hours of work for Capstan members. Even
with hour upon hour of work, we still had diffi-
. culties meeting deadlines; and, indeed, it might be
truthfully said that we might never have made
them had not a great deal of work 'been done by
Ensign C. L. Latimer, advisor. Many were the
nights he worked until the wee hours of the morning.
The advertising staff deserves its share of credit.
Efficiently and swiftly they canvassed the adver-
tisers, meeting their quota and making this book
available to you at what we think is a reasona-
ble price.	,
It was all fun. We only hope that something
has been created worth the time and, trouble, and >.
that you are pleased with the results.

.saxes; K. H. Killinger and R. M. Foote, trom-
bones; B. R. McEwen, R. L. MacCormick and
J. R. Durfey, trumpets; E. M. Casey, piano; G. W.
Walton, base fiddle; J. F. Ringeistein, drum; and ,
J. O. Crosby, guitar.
Despite an acute shortage of extra time, some
thirty-odd middies answered the first call for Capstan
volunteers, but as the term grew older the staff grew
smaller. We ended up with a mere handful who
still were willing to sacrifice liberty and jeopardize
academic standing to preserve for posterity the
things that happened to you at Notre Dame.
But that sounds noble and is not what we wish
to-convey. The men who are responsible for this
edition worked purely for the love of journalism,
art and photography. There was no ulterior mo-
tive, no selfishness, no desire to miss anything that
every other midshipman endured.
x Time was precious and weekends just meant
many hours of work for Capstan members. Even
with hour upon hour of work, we still had diffi-
culties meeting deadlines; and, indeed, it might be
truthfully said that we might never have made
them had not a great deal of work 'been done by
Ensign G. L. Latimer, advisor. Many were the
nights he worked until the wee hours of the morning.
The advertising staff deserves its share of credit.
Efficiently and swiftly they canvassed the adver-
tisers, meeting their quota and making this book
available to you at what we think is a reasona-
ble price.
It was all fun. We only hope that something
has been created worth the time and, trouble, and
that you are pleased with the results.

One of the world’s largest producers of military vehicles
Now producing the Army’s
Studebaker-built Wright Cyclone engines
for the Boeing Flying Fortress
Studebaker heavy-duty military trucks are
in service all over the world
THIS amazing new military ve-
hicle made its first large-scale
appearance in the combat areas,
’ ' coincident with the Allied landings
in Normandy.
Nicknamed the Weasel, because
of its stealth and swiftness and its '
uncanny ability to find footing on
virtually any kind of terrain, it’s the
brain-child of the Office of Scien-
tific Research and Development, the
War Department and . Studebaker
engineers.
It’s built by Studebaker under con-
tract with the Ordnance Depart-
ment; Army Service Forces.
It’s powered by a six-cylinder
Studebaker Champion engine.
The Weasel adds another major
item of war equipment to a list that
includes Studebaker-built Wright
Cyclone engines for the Boeing
Flying Fortress and heavy-duty, mul-
tiple-drive Studebaker military
trucks for the armies of the United
Nations. ■
Studebaker workers _ put a full
measure of traditional Studebaker
care and painstaking into the con-
struction of the Army’s M-29 Weasel.
They’ve left nothing undone to
make this unique vehicle of real
assistance to the valiant fighting
men of the armed forces.

Navy's new Grumman, "Hellcat" fighter plane can land safely because '
of Bendix-Pneudraulic Struts. These precision-built "land legs" com-
bine maximum strength with light weight. They (not the plane) take .
, the shock of the first contact of the wheels with the ground. Their
hydraulic cylinders cushion the impact and help to make the "Hell-
cat" one of the "sweetest planes to handle" the Navy airmen have had.
Bendix* Landing Gear is outstanding for its rugged strength, pre--
cision and simplicity which makes its advantages readily available to
all types of aircraft.

SOUTH BEND LATHE WORKS
£	SOUTH BEND 22, INDIANA
LATHE BUILDERS FOR 37 YEARS

Battling the sea with blasted hulk and crippled gear,
many a wounded ship has been brought safely into
port through the heroic efforts of its crew. Such a feat
calls for co of heads and fast work—for skilled hands,
and the right tools.
Fighting ships are huge machines composed of engines,
turbines, pumps, hundreds of precision instruments
and automatic controls, all of which must be kept in
order at all times. Maintenance and repair are always
important. But when it becomes a case of "fix it or
sink,” grave responsibilities fall upon the ship’s ma-
chine shop. Tool equipment must be equal to the
emergency—accuracy and speed are absolute require-
ments. The Navy expects machines, as well as men, 7
to deliver unfailing performance.	..
. It is significant that South Bend Lathes have been se-
lected for service in the machine shops on board many
of the Navy’s fighting ships. Providing these lathes is
one of our many wartime jobs.
