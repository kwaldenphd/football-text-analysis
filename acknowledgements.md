### Text and Data Mining for ND Archive Materials

Any text and data mining endeavor is supported by heroic and ongoing work that happens at the nexus of digital infrastructure, archives/special collections, metadata, digital preservation. The workflows outlined in this project would not be possible without significant past, present, and ongoing work from colleagues in the University of Notre Dame Libraries, specifically (but not exclusively)...
- [University Archives](http://archives.nd.edu/) (Patrick Milhoan, Scott Kirycki, Joseph Smith, and Matthew Wilken)
- [Rare Books and Special Collections](https://rarebooks.library.nd.edu/) (Rachel Bohlmann, Tracy Bergstrom, Sara Weber)
- [Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship](https://cds.library.nd.edu/) (Daniel Johnson, Eric Lease Morgan, Matthew Sisk)
- [Digital Services](https://directory.library.nd.edu/directory/departments/1195) (Mikala Narlock)
