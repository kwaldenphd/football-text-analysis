# Distant Reader

"The Distant Reader takes text as input, does analysis against it, and outputs sets of structured data called 'study carrels', which students, researchers, or scholars can use to do both close and distant reading...[it is] a tool intended to supplement the traditional reading process. Given a set of one or more texts acquired through a variety of means, the Reader: 1) applies different forms of text mining and natural language processing against the texts, 2) saves the results as a set of structured data amenable to computing, 3) summarizes everything in a set of interactive HTML reports, 4) compresses everything into a .zip file, and 5) provides the means for you to view the results online or download the whole thing to your computer. This resulting .zip file is affectionately called a 'study carrels."

To learn more about Distant Reader:
- [About](https://distantreader.org/about)
- [Getting Started](https://distantreader.org/getting-started)

57-You will need to have or create an ORCID to use Distant Reader.
- [Link to register](https://orcid.org/register)

58-Once you have an ORCID, log in to Distant Reader.

59-Let's create a carrel for the scholastic football review materials:
- Click on the "Create Carrels" menu item on the top of the page.
- Select the option to create a "New Carrel."
- Select the "Zip file" option
- Give your carrel a name
- Upload the `zip` folder of scholastic football reviews from 1901-1931 ([Link to download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zK99DK_Cd-w9tu2u2M5vlAOSidZYdVTd?usp=sharing)
- Click the "Create" button

60-The process of creating a carrel will take some time. Give it a few hours, come back, and you should see the new carrel under "Browse Carrels" and "Browse Your Carrels."

61-Once the carrel has been processed, you can click the "View" option to see Distant Reader's analysis of your text.

62-Spend some time exploring the carrel analysis and visualization.

## Distant Reader Reflection Questions
